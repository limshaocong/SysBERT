1999_dii_PURE,"Automatically: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent on information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information / parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved. Business Rule: A narrative description of policies, procedures, or principles within an organization. Business rules can be divided in to four categories: definitions, facts, constraints, and derivations. Definitions are business rules that define entities and attributes. Facts are either links (relationships) between entities or associations between an entity and attributes Constraints are conditions about the data that must always be true. They are the integrity rules that protect the data in the eventual database. Derivations are business rules that materialize a new piece of information (often attribute values) from other pieces of information. For example, a mathematical derivation might specify that you can obtain a person's age by subtracting his or her birth date from the current date. Commit/Rollback: An individual transaction is processed (commit) or discarded (rollback) by the proponent maintainer of the data items involved. Discretionary Access Controls (DAC): A means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission on to any other subject. Dynamically Generated Processing: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent upon information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information/parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved. Location Transparency: occurs when the physical location of data is transparent to the applications and users of the database system. For example, a view that joins table data from several databases provides location transparency because the user of the view does not need to know where the data originates from. Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Imediates access to an object based on the clearance level of the subject (user) and the sensitivity label of the object. (These controls are always enforced above any discretionary control implemented by users). Mirrored Databases: Replication and maintenance of a database on a transaction basis for the purpose of rapid error or failure recovery as supported by the resident COTS RDBMS own system utilities and operating system. Object: A passive entity that contains or receives information. Access to an object potentially implies access to the information it contains. Examples of objects are records, blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, directory trees, and programs, as well as bits, bytes, words, fields, processors, video displays, keyboards, clocks, printers, and network nodes. Proponent Scheme: Describes the sites at which databases are replicated and also who owns and has update authority with respect to the data at each site. It refers to proponency at the source and record level. Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID): A RAID system appears as one very large, reliable disk to the CPU. The main reason for using RAID storage is its reliability. RAID has the same advantages as shadowing and striping at a lower cost. There are several types/levels of RAID implementations, including: RAID 0 (known as disk striping), RAID 1 (known as disk shadowing), RAID 3 (in which data is distributed in small increments across all data disks and adds a parity value to a separate disk for recovery if any disk fails, RAID 4 (in which data is distributed in large chunks across all data disks and also has a single parity disk. RAID 4 intended to overcome performance penalties of RAID 3 for small transfers. RAID 5 (in which parity over RAID 3 or RAID 4 implementations), and RAID 6 ( in which two parity disks in addition to data disks are used in an attempt to further improve performance). In a RAID 5 implementation, the data is stored as are check sums and other information about the contents of each disk in the array. If one disk is lost, the others can use the check sums and other stored information to recreate the lost data. Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level implementations to improve performance and reliability. Remote Data Access (RDA): is an ISO (9579) application layer interoperability standard (protocol and formats) to support access by an application to a (remote) DBMSs over an OSI network. The goal of RDA is to allow interoperability between applications (clients) and databases (servers) of different manufacturers so that an application is able to read and update data in remote databases via well defined standards. RDA defines a set of client and server standards and a mapping of SQL commands to these services. RDA also defines an interface to ISO (transaction processing) two phase commit TP services in the case where updates to multiple remote databases need to be coordinated. RDA does not yet define interoperability between server databases (i.e. it is not yet a standard for distributed database management). Replication Scheme: Information that precisely identifies DBs, or partitions of DBs, to be copied and/or distributed, replication schedules, and master/remote sites that are to receive the copies. Spatial DBMS: Geographic information system that organizes and maintains spatial data (i.e. data with graphical attributes) in terms of type, scale, location(s), extent, topology and geometry. Supports queries of spatial data where the selection criteria are defined by spatial attributes. SRI: A Standing Request For Information (SRI) is a capability in which CASS monitors for the occurrence of conditions established by an application program, and notifies the calling or establishing application program when the conditions are satisfied. An SRI may be one of three types: timer-based, data-based, or message-based. Subject: An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or device that causes information to flow among objects or changes the system state. Technically, a process/domain pair. Transaction Journalling: Individual messages or database transactions are stored in a journal file, which may be a linear log file or a circular file."

1995_gemini_PURE,"Fault-tolerance and recovery See Attributes, Section 4.1 on page 4 - 1. Error logging. There are three types of errors: Fatal Fatal errors occur if there is no acceptable recovery procedure that will allow operation to proceed. Under fatal error conditions, the system falls back to a safe ""backup"" state requiring human intervention for restart. Serious Under serious errors, the system does not need to move off-line, but the current operation cannot be completed. Serious errors require human intervention to restart full operation. Warning All other unexpected conditions result in warnings that are properly logged. The system continues operation, though perhaps with reduced eficiency. All subsystems must group errors into these categories. In addition, errors that result in an ""alarm"" should be described, along with the proper action required to acknowledge and eliminate the alarm condition. Besides the time-stamp, error logging should provide enough information to trace the condition back to its apparent source, both in equipment and in event sequence. There should be tools available to extract error (and other) logging information by subsystem component, time- sequence, previous events, and so on. The Gemini Control System formally distinguishes alarms from errors. Errors result from failures to successfully complete commands, while alarms represent asynchronous failures. Note that an error may result in an alarm.There are two types of alarm conditions. The define are automatically monitored alarms, which exist as long as the errors persist and are then automatically cleared. The second type of alarm require human acknowledgment to clear. Recovery In addition to start-up procedures, there must be well-defined recovery procedures for any subsystem that has become inoperative. Command retries must be included in the system for most common timeouts or noresponse conditions. These retries should occur automatically in the command handling to avoid unnecessary error conditions. Performance The performance of error-mode recovery is specific to the subsystem and is defined in the Functional specification for that subsystem. Normally, there is no recovery possible from a fatal error except to shut-down and then restart the subsystem. However, in the case of an instrument failure, it may be possible to continue operation by rescheduling to use observations that do not require that particular instrument For serious errors, it may be possible to continue operation with degraded performance. For example, failure of automatic tracking may require manual tracking; other errors may result in operation with a different instrument Under normal conditions, the number of warnings should be small. The system should monitor the rate of warning messages since an increase might indicate that some tuning or maintenance is appropriate. Ideally, such conditions should be noted by the subsystems before reaching the OCS level. Failure conditions should not cascade. That is, failure of one subsystem should not affect other, working, subsystems, including communication links."

Independently of the location of users at the telescope site, they shall be able to access (according to their privileges) any part of the whole setup with a simple logon and coniguration operation. In other words. any subsection of the whole Gemini 8m Telescopes system should be accessible and controllable from any single point (but of course with protection ensuring security and safety). A particularly simple case of multi-use of the system is multi-point monitoring. By this it is meant that, while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, someone else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and instruments. This will typically be needed by the operation supervisor. All other users wishing to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by Operations and get permission to do so. The multi-point monitoring mode might also be important when certain dificult or rare problems occur, when expert advice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely. Multi-point monitoring allows them to follow directly the results of tests performed and investigate how the system is working (e.g. by selecting different display pages with the up-to-date status information on different parts of the system). Multi-point monitoring also allows a local observer to be monitored and advised by a remote supervisor.
