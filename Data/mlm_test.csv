2007_getreal02_PURE,"Users are typical Oregon high school students, grades 9 to12 in ALL high schools across Oregon. Two potential groups of viewers (students) exist: 1) students interested in CS finding more concise information about a CS career, and 2) college bound students not necessarily interested in CS who might be attracted to a CS career with the right âpushâ from information on the Get Real site. A third group of students might be those interested careers as diverse as protein research, weather prediction, neurobotics, medicine, law or other sciences where a CS minor could contribute to a better understanding of data and information. A âConsider a CS minorâ section could provide helpful information. Oregon High school students from several schools and classes were interviewed to gain their feedback on version 1 of the Get Real site. Common themes emerged in the need to change/update overall site graphic design and real people. Students who are not generally interested in CS, suggested graphic design changes, more white space, pictures, and easier to navigate pages. This group was much less tolerant of the site than the CS folks had been. They wanted a site that âspoke to themâ and felt that if you were not a computer science student, it had very little to offer. The suggestion was very strong that the site be broken into more readable chunks of information. The term âwalls of textâ appeared several times. The need for more visually attractive information also was a central theme. They wanted color, photos, diagrams, charts, etc. to break up the text and make the site attractive. Many of them commented positively on the spinning globe and satellite menu. Students who are interested in CS and engineering suggested changes in the Real People, Resources, and Colleges sections. Most of them spent their time in the college comparison chart, and in the real people part of the site. It sounded like they were attracted by the pictures. Several commented positively on the sections in each personâs story. The college comparison chart again scored positive marks. Changes to version 2 should include design changes to all existing pages to shorten up paragraphs and add bullets and charts where possible to accommodate faster page reading and shorter reader attention span. One example used on the engineergirl.org site uses an interactive table menu for more detailed information, leaving the main pages short and to the point.

(b) Verify that the output indication is within ±3 dB of the applied signal, considering all losses from the generator to the measurement receiver and, if deviations larger than 3 dB are found, locate the source of the error and correct the deficiency before proceeding.         (c) Connect the receive antenna to the coaxial cable as specified in Figure 5-28, set the signal source to 1 kHz pulse modulation, 50 % duty cycle, establish an electric field at the test frequency by using a transmitting antenna and amplifier, and gradually increase the electric field level until it reaches the limit specified by application of clause 4.2.8.

2008_peering_PURE,"CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise. It is formed by a set of autonomous CDNs, which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure for cooperation in order to virtualize multiple providers. It is expected that an effective peering arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur. Initiation: A CDNâs reach and scale is limited by its ability to handle peak load, cost of equipment, scalable infrastructure, and/or demand for the increased coverage of its infrastructure. Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing with other CDN(s). It is triggered by an initialization request sent to the mediator under exceptional circumstances, e.g. flash crowds, when the (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the workload on its Web Servers (WSs). The triggering condition must consider the expected and unexpected load increases in the initiating CDN. Negotiated relationship: The controlling interest of a CDN to interconnect with other CDNs leads to the creation of a negotiated relationship. In the business domain, this relationship (most likely) would take the form of a legal document which describes the expected level of services from the involving parties such as storage requirements, the required rate of transfer, cost of services; the expected duration of receiving service, penalties for service violations, and other preconditions such as the initiating CDNâs preference to gain resources at a particular region. Negotiated relationships can also be established through means nontechnical terms (financial statement) or technical terms (SLAs). Thus, negotiated relationships must specify the interactions among entities including service administration, coordination and disband (or re-arrangement) of internetworked CDNs. In the CDN peering architecture, the mediator instance obtains the resource and access information from the Service Registry (SR), whilst SLAs and other policies from the Policy Repository (PR). The mediator instance on the primary CDNâs behalf generates its service requirements based on the current circumstance and SLA requirements of its customer(s). Therefore, divergent policies are allowed that specify the information that can be shared during interaction through providing a certain level of visibility to preserve privacy. Resource discovery: Once the initiating CDN identifies its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with. The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers. The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs. If there are any preexisting peering arrangements (for a long term scenario) then these will be returned at this point. Otherwise, it carries out short term negotiations with the Peering Agent (PA) identified peering targets. CDN peering protocols: The next step is to configure the âCDN peeringâ protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly specified through the negotiated relationships. This step includes advertising the configurations (topology aspects, geographical proximity, capability, performance, etc.) of enlisted CDNs through inter-PA communication. On establishment of a peering arrangement, these protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer. Request-redirection in a peering arrangement depends on the content distribution and request-routing policies (specified in the CDN peering protocols) associated with the content as well as the specific algorithms and methods used for directing these requests. Operational management: When the primary CDN acquires sufficient resources from the peers to meet its SLA with the customer, the new peering arrangement becomes operational. Hence, necessary functional policies are deployed and administered in an effective way. Once a peering arrangement is established, all participating parties cooperate in the execution of common goal(s). Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships. If no CDN is interested in such peering, peering arrangement creation through re-negotiation is resumed by tuning the negotiated relationships with reconsidered service requirements. Disband or re-arrangement: An existing peering arrangement may need to either disband or re-arrange itself (within the scope of the negotiated relationships) if any of the following conditions hold: (a) the circumstances under which the arrangement was formed no longer hold; (b) peering is no longer beneficial for the participating CDNs; (c) an existing peering arrangement needs to be expanded further in order to deal with additional load; or (d) participating CDNs are not meeting their agreed upon contributions. Figure 1 presents the interaction flows within the architecture of the CDN peering with an abstraction on its components."

The software must be strictly modular, i.e. the functionality of a subsystem should correspond to that which belongs to that subsystem and only to that, so that software for different subsystems can be installed and maintained independently of all the rest.This is needed in particular for multi-instrument operation, for example, as instruments share the same subsystems on the telescope. At the same time, the possibility must exist to acquire information about other parts of the system (for example, telescope coordinates) (as mentioned in the control requirements in Section 3.1.1).
