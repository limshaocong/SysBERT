2008_peering_PURE,"The software infrastructure enabling peering between CDNs can be featured with the following major goals: Development and validation of peering and manage the complexity of content delivery across Web servers of multiple CDNs that scale across the globe. Decrease cost of Web access, increase QoS through reduced latency, reduce server load, and bandwidth consumption (by a particular CDN server), thus improving the performance of content delivery. Assists an existing CDN to alleviate congestions by detecting and handling short-term load spikes (i.e. flash crowds) effectively. The operations performed by the product components [3] assist to realize the above goals. Component-wise major functions are noted below. The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents are as follows, A Web server replicates content on-demand from the origin server and stores it for future use. In the event of Web hotspot, it initiates request to trigger peering. The Web services host ensures the delivery of content to end-users based on the negotiated policies with other CDNs. The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted. The SLA-allocator performs the provisioning and reservation of Web serverâs resources (e.g. CPU, bandwidth, storage etc.) to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced. The Web serversâ underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers. The Mediator performs the following major functions, It generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships. It passes the service requirements to the PA. It works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs. Once a peering arrangement is established, it controls what portion of the Web traffic (i.e. end-user requests) is redirected to the Web servers of the peering CDNs, which content is replicated there, how the replication decision is taken, and which replication policies are being used. It ensures that the participating entities are able to adapt to changing circumstances (agility) and are able to achieve their objectives in a dynamic and uncertain environment (resilience) The main functions of the Service Registry are as follows, It encapsulates the resource and service information for each CDN. It helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details. In the face of traffic surges, it supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator. When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources. The Policy Repository is used to perform the following functions, It virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including PWS, PM, and PPeering (i.e. Web server-specific policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peering arrangement. It provides a set of rules to the mediator to administer, manage, and control access to the resources in a peering arrangement. It returns existing peering policies to the PA during the establishment of long-term peering arrangements. A Peering Agent carries out the following major functions, It acts as a policy-driven resource discovery module for establishing negotiations. It exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs. It is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with PAs of other peers and to acquire resources from them. The operations performed by the components of the CDN peering is driven by semi-autonomous logic that ensures content is served reliably through content replication, request-routing and redirection whilst maintaining constant awareness of the health (e.g. load information) of participants. These major architectural features of the CDN peering are briefly described in the following: Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data. Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach, where current bandwidth and resource usage of web servers in a CDN is reported to the CDN gateway (i.e. mediator, PA and policy repository as a single conceptual entity) in a periodic or thresholdbased manner. The gateways of participating CDNs then communicate aggregated load information describing the load of their constituent servers. Request assignment and redirection is performed at multiple levels â at the DNS, at the gateways to local clusters, and also (redirection) between servers in a cluster. Therefore, endusers can be assigned via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate."

1995_gemini_PURE,"Observing, as such, is the purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. But interactive observing is perhaps, in some cases, not the most efficient way to achieve this, although it will be necessary for certain kinds of observations (such as adaptive optics) and in certain phases (such as commissioning and test periods). Service observing, on the other hand, means that the observing program can be performed by someone other than the proposing astronomer. It will be done on his behalf at a convenient moment that is not exactly predefined and may be intermixed with programs from other users. Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments. This might typically be a few times (2) per night, when sky conditions change. It requires also that the observing program is so well specified that it can be executed by someone else. In other words, it requires a computer executable observing program. Service observing requires a suitable organization to support it, and define of all, considerable experience with a smooth running system. For these reasons it can only be applied to the Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been fulilled and been in operation for a while. Nevertheless, the software and data structures to support classical observing which have to be present in a system that is only interactive at the start might require considerable redesign to be adapted later to the service observing requirement"

Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, they may become telescope operators, operations supervisors of the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope, and instrument operators and have to overview the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation. These users will be very experienced users of the system. They will be very familiar with the Gemini 8m Telescopes and/or its instruments. Purpose of work Operations staff will control the Gemini 8m Telescopes indirectly via a scheduler program or directly via commands. They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments efficiently. They shall also monitor general performance and system safety. Privileges Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance procedures in case of problems. This includes direct control of physical units. However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal operation. If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures have to be run. Operation mode Operations staff shall have access to operation tables in update mode, while observing astronomers will have access to them only in read mode (for example the list of filters mounted on an instrument). Again, the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. At the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument requirements in this area. They shall be able to change the operational status of units according to the results of tests performed on such units (e.g. to see if a faulty unit can be declared as operational again and redefined as part of the environment in use)."
