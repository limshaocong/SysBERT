2009_spica_srd_WEB,The telescope operating temperature shall be stable to within 0.25K over a typical observation duration.
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"The telescope shall provide adequate internal straylight control such as baffling to allow for SPICA observations with sky-limited sensitivity. In particular, the straylight rejection level shall be such that total background from out-of-field stray sources (artificial and natural) shall not increase the in-field optical background signal (from zodiacal light and telescope thermal self-emission) by more than 20% (goal G15: 10% TBC)."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"Any emission from observatory structure at surface temperatures >10K (respectively >50K, TBC), that enters the FIR instrument FoV (respectively the MIR instrument FoV) at telescope focal plane shall be attenuated by the telescope system and associated baffles in order to reduce the view factor to these surfaces (including their in-band emissivity and from the focal plane instrument field of view) to less than 1 part in 104 (TBC)."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,"Scattered light from any natural source inside the telescope field of view (but outside the respective field of view of the focal plane instruments) shall contribute, into the respective aperture (defined by the respective FoV) of any focal plane instrument, less than 10-3 (TBC) of its peak irradiance when imaged by the telescope."
2009_spica_srd_WEB,Scattered light from any natural source outside the telescope field of view shall be attenuated to the maximum following tabulated relative levels defining the telescope PST in any azimuthal direction:
1995_gemini_PURE,The document defines the operational requirements for Gemini Control System software. The goal of the SRS is to provide a functional tool for guiding the development of controls and data acquisition systems in a manner consistent with their operation within the Gemini System. It establishes both general criteria and specific functional requirements for software and controls design in the Gemini Project.
1995_gemini_PURE,"It is oriented toward the developers of control and data acquisition systems, not toward the science user of the Gemini telescopes. As such, it logically follows the Operational Concepts document, which addresses the control of the Gemini system from a more general perspective. The impacts of the science requirements, as well as requirements of control system design are covered in this document."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The users of the Gemini system are classified into the following categories. A.Astronomer. This person is using the Gemini system for the collection of science data. In a very real sense, the astronomer is the customer for the services provided by the Gemini telescopes. The astronomer has worked out, with the Gemini system, a science plan for the collection of the data. This science plan may include interactive observing. B.Science observer. This is the on-site person responsible for monitoring the data acquisition and validating the data integrity being collected for the astronomer, as well as ensuring that the science plan is functioning to the needs of the astronomer. C.Telescope Operator. The on-site controller of the telescope and instruments. This person is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the system and for keeping the system functioning accurately during observations. The Telescope Operator works with the Observer and the science plan to produce as good data as is possible. D.Support. On-site (or near-site) support personnel are responsible for the maintenance of the system, hardware and software, as well as the installation of subsystems and configuration changes. E.Developer. Developers are responsible for the designing, testing, configuring, and upgrading of subsystems. F.Administrator. Administrators are responsible for high-level functional control of the Gemini system as an integrated system. They work with other users to determine appropriate observation scheduling changes, maintenance down-time, and system modifications. It is possible that a particular individual would fall into several of the categories. For example, it is not unusual for the astronomer to also be the science observer."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Gemini system, when powered on, exists in one of several disjoint operational levels. Access to the system is restricted according to the current level of operation. The operational levels are: A.Observing level. The observing level is the normal operational mode of the system. B.Maintenance level. Maintenance level permits access to all subsystems for routine maintenance and diagnostic work. The telescope is typically at maintenance level during daylight (non-observing) hours. C.Test level. The most primitive operational level, test level operation is used for installation/deinstallation of subsystems, including full diagnostics and installation calibration activities."
1995_gemini_PURE,"At any level, but particularly during observing level operation, the software imposes on the Gemini system a series of access modes. These access modes balance ease and convenience of use against flexibility, control, and the security of the system. The access modes provided by the Gemini system are: A.Observing. This mode provides simple and safe access to the system for the collection of science data, selection of instrument parameters, and quick-look data reduction. Access to the system is through the sequencer with no direct control of telescope and instruments B.Monitoring. This is a special, read-only case of the observing mode that can be invoked on a subsystem basis. Under no circumstances should monitoring affect the performance of an ongoing observation C.Operation. This is the access used for direct control of the telescope and instruments, typically during observation level operation. It is normally available only to the Telescope Operator and the science program sequencer when at operation level. D.Planning. Access to the Gemini system is provided during science planning. Actual access to the telescope is not permitted in this mode, but the virtual telescope capability of the Gemini system provides a telescope simulator that is useful for planning observations, as are on-line databases. E.Testing. Test access allows full, direct control of any subsystem. All features of the subsystem are available in this mode. Under no circumstances should testing affect the performance of an ongoing observation. F.Administrative. It is possible to inquire about system utilization, efficiency, etc. using administrative access. No control is available in this mode, only status and scheduling information is accessible. Under no circumstances should administrative access affect the performance of an ongoing observation. It is entirely possible for a single user to be accessing the system through several modes simultaneously. In fact, this is the typical situation with the Telescope Operator, who is often concurrently accessing the system through the observer, monitor, and operator modes. There are times when an astronomer might be using both observer and monitor modes."
1995_gemini_PURE,Users of the system will be located at one or more facilities. These are referred to in general as Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities. The Gemini 8m Telescopes enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility are referred to collectively as the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.
1995_gemini_PURE,This is the enclosure housing the telescope. In general such use would be limited to maintenance and engineering.
1995_gemini_PURE,This is the facility collocated with the enclosure. It is from here that nightly operations would take place.
1995_gemini_PURE,This is the facility where off duty personnel reside while stationed on the summit. This would be the Hale Pohaku facility on Mauna Kea and Cerro Tololo in Chile (assuming no support facility is constructed on Cerro Pachon).
1995_gemini_PURE,"This is the facility where offices, shops, etc. are located. On Hawaii this would be with the JACH in Hilo and in Chile it would be either the La Serena or Cerro Tololo facilities."
1995_gemini_PURE,"These are super sites, in general located in partner countries, which have direct links to the telescopes via communications lines. They may or may not be collocated with any administrative organization associated with the Gemini telescopes. These sites have remote operations capability"
1995_gemini_PURE,"These are sites with high bandwidth connections to the super sites. They have remote operations capability but at a reduced level. Will these high bandwidth connections be private or public, or doesn't it matter? I don't understand the different between a remote operations facility and a satellite site. Why does the satellite site not just connect directly to the telescope?  Steven."
1995_gemini_PURE,"These are sites, generally located at existing observatories, universities, etc. that have some form of connectivity, perhaps via satellite sites and/or super sites, to the telescopes. Although they have remote operations capability, the link capacity will determine at what level."
1995_gemini_PURE,Each class of users has different needs of the system. The general requirements of each user class are summarized below.
1995_gemini_PURE,"Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, all requirements and modes presented are intended to be available to all users of the system. It should also be noted that what the system has to guarantee in terms of operations must fulfill all possible requirements, but it does not mean that all features will be made available to all users at all locations at all times. The available capabilities will have to be adapted to the operational needs both locally and remotely and these decisions can only be taken later in the life of the project."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Definition Observing astronomers are the end users of the system. They range greatly in experience from occasional users of the system to very experienced users such as staff astronomers at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site and service observers. Purpose of work Whatever their level of experience, observing astronomers will wish to concentrate on the efficient acquisition of astronomical data and on-line assessment of data quality, rather than on the details of controlling the telescope and instruments. To allow observing astronomers to achieve this objective, the system must offer to a user an interface which, while fulfilling the various operational requirements in the different modes and offering status information both automatically and on request at any required level, is still simple to learn and secure in its use. Privileges Observing astronomers shall have no privileges as far as the direct control of the telescope is concerned. They shall not be able to send control commands directly but they must be able to enquire about the status of the telescope or any subsystem at any time. The intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. Programs, as opposed to observers, may have the capability of direct control of the telescope. This would allow the observer to create an observing program which requested a telescope control function but would not allow the observer to enter (for instance) a command to slew the mount. Astronomers are typically given control access to instruments, however. Operation mode Traditional interactive operation shall normally be replaced by operation via an automatic sequencer. This is essential to support operational requirements such as service observing and flexible scheduling (as defined later in Section 2.7 on page 2-12). A certain degree of interaction shall be provided, meaning in this case that the user will interact with the scheduler program, rather than with the control programs directly. Observing commands will normally be submitted via the User interface to a queue for later execution. It must also be possible to break and resequence this queue. e.g. as a result of the quality assessment of previous data. In particular, Operations staff will be able to enable direct interactive operation, but this shall not be considered as the normal operation mode for the reasons explained in Section 2.7 on page 2-12. It is evident that, for some functions (such as adjustment of spectrograph slit width for seeing conditions) it must be necessary to include interactive capability. However each instance of such a function should be examined as a candidate for automation - such as focussing. The existence of the scheduling queue shall be transparent to the on-site observer during the initial phases of telescope operation. Only after experience has been gained with the system will the existence of the queue become evident to the on site observer."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Definition Currently, operations staff includes 'night assistants' and staff of the 'operations group'. Depending on the operations implemented on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, they may become telescope operators, operations supervisors of the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope, and instrument operators and have to overview the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation. These users will be very experienced users of the system. They will be very familiar with the Gemini 8m Telescopes and/or its instruments. Purpose of work Operations staff will control the Gemini 8m Telescopes indirectly via a scheduler program or directly via commands. They will supervise telescope operation and will be able to advise observing astronomers on what they have to do to use telescope and instruments efficiently. They shall also monitor general performance and system safety. Privileges Operations staff shall have privileges to access all commands and maintenance procedures in case of problems. This includes direct control of physical units. However, they shall not have access to subsystems while these are in normal operation. If they need to access other parts of the system appropriate reconfiguration procedures have to be run. Operation mode Operations staff shall have access to operation tables in update mode, while observing astronomers will have access to them only in read mode (for example the list of filters mounted on an instrument). Again, the intent is not to restrict the capabilities of the observing astronomer in any way but rather to establish a single point of control and responsibility. At the present time it is not clear how to handle visitor instrument requirements in this area. They shall be able to change the operational status of units according to the results of tests performed on such units (e.g. to see if a faulty unit can be declared as operational again and redefined as part of the environment in use)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Definition Software development and maintenance are staff: ¢based either at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or base facility, or ¢based at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility, or ¢non Gemini staff from a contract company or from an associated Institute. These users will have a deep understanding of the way the Gemini 8m Telescopes software works. Purpose of work Software development and maintenance staff intervene when there is a major problem to be solved or an upgrade to be installed. They also perform system generation and installation of new software packages or new releases, according to established test and validation procedures. Privileges Software development and maintenance staff need the highest privilege in order to be able to modify everything in the system. Nevertheless strict configuration control guidelines must be followed to prevent interference with ongoing normal operation. Operation mode Software development and maintenance staff usually work at the test level (see Section 3.2.1.3 on page 3-4) for the part of the software under test. Other parts of the Gemini 8m Telescopes may also need to run in test mode to support integration tests. This means that a number of commands are available which allow the hardware concerned to be tested (test commands) and are not accessible to observing astronomers."
1995_gemini_PURE,"This section derives directly from Gemini 8m Telescopes program requirements and specifies the operational context, which is a direct consequence of the structure of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. The Gemini 8m Telescopes operation has to cope with a complex environment produced by: multi-telescope concept multi-instrument context visitors instrument context multi-user context."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Although there are two telescopes as part of the Gemini system there are no plans to support concurrent use of them as if they were a single facility. It is, however, a long term goal of the Gemini project to be capable of being used in conjunction with nearby, perhaps non-Gemini, telescopes on the same site (for instance for interferometry)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Normally three scientific instruments are mounted on the cassegrain focus of the telescope. The Gemini 8m Telescopes are thus characterized all the time as in a multi-instrument context. Parallel access to all the mounted instruments shall be provided, though only one instrument has access to the telescope beam (active instrument).Instruments which feed two detectors by using beam splitters or ield splitters is considered as a single active instrument. Feeding two separate instruments via beam splitters or ield splitters and providing separate control nodes is not a requirement. Various situations are possible for the other (inactive) instruments: they shall be able to take calibration or ï¬at ield exposures in parallel they shall be able to prepare for an exposure to start as soon as the telescope beam is switched back to them (in this case, they are in a hot standby situation) they shall be able to work; at all foreseen operation levels (observing, maintenance, test) (see Section 3.2.1 on page 3-3)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Regardless of the status of an inactive instrument, it shall not be possible for any of its permitted actions to adversely impact the active instrument"
1995_gemini_PURE,"The requirement to provide for support, installation, and operation of outside instruments brought by the observer has several implications for the system. Due to the specialized nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that complete integration into the Gemini environment is either feasible or warranted. In this case a subset of the available functionality must be made available through a standardized interface. The Gemini Telescopes view all instruments as operating as servers, responding to commands from the upper levels of the system. Visitor instruments must be capable of operating in this mode to be adequately supported. It should be the goal of this interface that it be a subset of the existing instrumentation interface (rather than a separate system). At a minimum this interface should support: acquisition of status information of instrument by other systems capability to enter preprogrammed observing sequences capability to offset the telescope position and focus"
1995_gemini_PURE,"It should be a goal, but not a requirement, that the interface provide support for coordinate transforms between visitor instrument and the Gemini system archiving (or archivibility) of visitor instrument data maintenance of operations tables (such as ilter lists) which can become part of an observation's permanent record"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Due to the nature of visitor instrumentation it is unlikely that more complicated functionality can be supported. In particular coordinated motions of the Gemini system components with those of the visitor instrument (other than simple raster scans) will not be supported. This does not mean that more complicated functionality will not be possible for visitor instruments that require it. Such functionality will not be offered as a standard service but will require a joint effort on the part of Gemini and the visitor instrument team. As more complicated functionality will be supported via standardized interfaces for the Gemini instruments, such as coordinated motions, it should be possible to adapt visitor instruments to this standard. The dificulty with offering such services as an externally supported standard, as opposed to an internally supported standard, is that decisions to change internal standards do not impact external users. It is important that the visitor instrument interface be stable and long-lived, as the time between successive uses of the same visitor instrument can be as long as one or two years. The support of visitor instrumentation is made simpler if the visitor equipment adheres to the Gemini standards. However it must be recognized that: the Gemini standards may not prove cost effective for some visitor instruments the Gemini standards will evolve over time as requirements and technology change the evolution of Gemini standards might require existing visitor instruments to rewrite or rework large areas of their control system visitor instruments built later in time than the initial complement of Gemini instruments may want to take advantage of different and/or less expensive technology if it better suits the goals of their project"
1995_gemini_PURE,"For these reasons it is probably not possible to establish a combined standard to which all instruments, both Gemini and visitor, adhere to completely. It is much better to establish a subset of Gemini facilities which will be made available to visitor instruments via long lived, stable interfaces. Visitor requirements outside of these would be handled on an as needed basis. The support of both Gemini and visitor instruments would beneit by the provision of a Gemini observatory simulator. This simulator, appearing to the instrument as a standard set of hardware and software interfaces, would present a functional Definition of the observatory"
1995_gemini_PURE,"The requirements to have instruments operated as single units imply that several user stations will be active at the same time on the Gemini 8m Telescopes. On these user stations, different kinds of users may be working at the same time with the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. Independently of the location of users at the telescope site, they shall be able to access (according to their privileges) any part of the whole setup with a simple logon and coniguration operation. In other words. any subsection of the whole Gemini 8m Telescopes system should be accessible and controllable from any single point (but of course with protection ensuring security and safety). A particularly simple case of multi-use of the system is multi-point monitoring. By this it is meant that, while some (active) user is in control of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, someone else can follow what they are doing by monitoring all the relevant data from telescope and instruments. This will typically be needed by the operation supervisor. All other users wishing to monitor Gemini 8m Telescopes operations have to go through the procedures set up by Operations and get permission to do so. The multi-point monitoring mode might also be important when certain dificult or rare problems occur, when expert advice is needed and can only be obtained from colleagues situated remotely. Multi-point monitoring allows them to follow directly the results of tests performed and investigate how the system is working (e.g. by selecting different display pages with the up-to-date status information on different parts of the system). Multi-point monitoring also allows a local observer to be monitored and advised by a remote supervisor. Monitoring shall exist both in the form of automatic displays of status information at different locations, and in the form of explicit access to the required status information from any point. Monitoring shall not affect the performance of ongoing observations."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The different observing modes (interactive, queue-based, remote-operations and service) impose constraints on software design."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Requirements: .Normally executed with the sequencer by providing a computer executable program, in order to make efficient use of the Gemini telescope. .Interactive operation is supported, but always through the Observatory Control System (OCS). .There is a visual user interface to the OCS to allow for changes to the viewing program. It is possible to have more than one station participate in the observing."
1995_gemini_PURE,Interactive observing with time allocation for full nights is a define basic requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes. It is therefore an essential requirement that telescope operation is supported by the software in a smooth and very friendly way in this mode. Interaction will normally be via an automatic sequencer (see Section 2.5.9 on page 2-6). This is clearly a top priority requirement and one which will have to be realized before implementing any other mode. The initial implementation of the automatic sequencer will operate in a pass throughmode where all commands are accepted and transmitted with minimal checking and delay.
1995_gemini_PURE,"Queue-based observing is the primary observation mode used with the Gemini telescopes, as it is the best means of providing sound science data while maximizing efficient use of the telescope. While its requirements include all those given below for service observing, it has the following special requirements. The observing program must be fully automated, requiring very little human interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software must include a suficiently rich programming environment to make this feasible. In addition, this should be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to the astronomer. There should be a full telescope simulator to enable the astronomer to test observing programs for completeness, errors, and functionality. This simulator should function within the virtual telescope environment of the Gemini system. All control software must provide support for simulated use within the virtual telescope There is a requirement for software to assist in object selection both within an observing program and across observing programs, in order to optimize observing eficiency. This software must consider target positions, weather conditions, and instrument conigurations There must be software to support the ï¬exible scheduling, both manually and via a scheduler, allowing for the interleaving of observing programs in a manner that is transparent to the individual observing programs. This includes managing the collection of science, environmental, engineering, reference, and calibration data. To maximize the use of the available observing time it must be possible to queue all of the observing that is possible with the currently available instruments. These would be in the form of preprogrammed observing sequences. It should be possible to resort the queue so that the next observation to take place comes to the front of the queue. This sorting will be based on properties of the individual observing sequences, current site conditions, and other rules established by the observatory directorate.While these rules have yet to be worked out one could imagine rules such as no more than 15% of observing will be preempted or a 10% overhead to the prime observing project is acceptable in order to pick up observations in similar parts of the sky with identical ilters."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Thus queue scheduling is a superset of preprogrammed observing, with similar requirements. As the costs of implementing such a scheduler are currently dificult to estimate it may prove necessary to implement it in a future phase of the project. The system design, if it does not include a scheduler, should specifically allow for its future implementation."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Remote operations includes both remote observing, with the science observer offsite, and remote telescope operation, with control of the telescope also off- site. It also covers remote eavesdropping, monitoring, coniguration, and diagnosis. (There will always be support staff on-site during observations, however.) The requirements for supporting remote operations are: All software should be developed to permit remote operations. There should be no conceptual difference between software working on-site and remotely. All observing facilities should work both on-site and off-site. It should be possible to do full operations remotely Team observing, with multiple observers at different sites should be supported. It must be possible to restrict specific operations to specific remote sites. For example, at the Mauna Kea site, remote telescope control might be restricted to Hale Pohaku. The method used to restrict such operations should be independent of the operations themselves, and dynamic. It is assumed that the hardware involved in remote operations has been specified with suficient bandwidth to support remote operations. However, we will take advantage of commercially available protocols such as ISDN, TCP/IP, Internet, etc."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The choice of the name remote operations is meant to suggest an entire category of operations, such as remote observing but also remote access for diagnostic support. In this sense it is more general than pure remote observing. Despite the obvious limitations introduced by the link bandwidths available at the different locations, the system shall be totally transparent to local or remote use. It is only necessary that the functionality of the system be transparent, it is accepted that the speed of the link will determine the perceived transparency of the system. However the system design should minimize the impact of link bandwidth on transparency. Security of operation shall be considered and might imply different operation levels and privileges at different sites. It is required that the remote operations software be considered from the beginning in the Gemini 8m Telescopes software design, to avoid redesign later. This should reduce the amount of specific software needed for remote operations, as the common layers of software shall cope from the beginning with a distributed environment."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Remote control means that the function normally associated with a local Telescope Operator, that of entering telescope control commands, would be available from a remote site. In practice remote control will be restricted to the Gemini 8m Telescopes Enclosure and Gemini 8m Telescopes Control Facility. The philosophy behind this is that, for safety considerations, telescope control commands cannot be issued without a staff member (not necessarily the same person) having direct access to: a hard wired stop button real time video and audio control of the telescope"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Remote observing means that users shall be able to observe from a remote site such as Cerro Tololo, Hilo or even home Institutes. This possibility has to be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes. The extent to which realistic observing conditions can be reproduced depends, of course, largely on the link bandwidth available. Experience with previous telescopes at other OBSERVING MODE REQUIREMENTS observatories shows, however, that, even with very limited bandwidths, remote observing can be implemented, provided the software is suitable for this. Remote observing, as meant in this context, does not mean remote control. Remote users shall normally interact with the system via operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes control facility operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site facility operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facility operators at the Gemini 8m Telescopes remote operations facility via the scheduler program and shall not control any part of the Gemini 8m Telescopes directly."
1995_gemini_PURE,In the last case they will use a remote User interface to submit commands to the Gemini 8m Telescopes scheduler at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site.
1995_gemini_PURE,In this mode the monitor's screen appears as a duplicate of that seen by the observer. The monitor's keyboard would not have any effect on the observer's environment
1995_gemini_PURE,"Remote monitoring is the simplest level of remote observing. It is sometimes called 'eavesdropping'. It is a requirement for the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation and will complement service observing, making it friendlier for users. Remote monitoring coincides to a large extent with multipoint monitoring, but allows the remote user to pick and choose the information that is displayed on the remote screen. There is no requirement that the remote screen be a duplicate of the local screen. The remote keyboard will have no effect on the local user's environment. A remote observer might also need a real-time video and voice link with the operator in the control room, perhaps using a portable video camera which the operator can position as necessary. It is assumed this facility is provided entirely by hardware, and is beyond the scope of the Gemini software."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Quite apart from remote observing, remote access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes and its instruments is required for monitoring and diagnostic purposes. This might be necessary to back up local users expertise and to help in case of problems. Remote access, in this case, must be possible from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facility. Distributed access to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software, once implemented. also allows, without extra requirements, local access (at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site) or remote access (Gemini 8m Telescopes support, base, and remote operations facilities)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Service observing implies that the Gemini staff are responsible for performing the actual data collection for the astronomer. A special case of service observing, queue-based, is given earlier, and assumes that the observing program can be executed with minimal interaction with the client astronomer. The more general case, where a science observer is present on site and the client astronomer is remotely connected, is considered here. The requirements specific to service observing are: The observing program must be automated, requiring little human interaction during the observation. The means that the Gemini software must include a suficiently rich programming environment to make this feasible. In addition, this should be a visually-oriented environment providing a simple, easy-to-use interface to the astronomer. This programming environment should be available both to the astronomer, for developing the program, and to the observer, for review and adjustment of the program. This access may or may not be done concurrently on a shared environment. The programming environment should allow for the communication of special notes, instructions, and comments from the astronomer to the observer, possibly involving multimedia techniques. The use of this feature would, however, be discouraged for queue-based observing."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Observing, as such, is the purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. But interactive observing is perhaps, in some cases, not the most efficient way to achieve this, although it will be necessary for certain kinds of observations (such as adaptive optics) and in certain phases (such as commissioning and test periods). Service observing, on the other hand, means that the observing program can be performed by someone other than the proposing astronomer. It will be done on his behalf at a convenient moment that is not exactly predefined and may be intermixed with programs from other users. Service observing requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments. This might typically be a few times (2) per night, when sky conditions change. It requires also that the observing program is so well specified that it can be executed by someone else. In other words, it requires a computer executable observing program. Service observing requires a suitable organization to support it, and define of all, considerable experience with a smooth running system. For these reasons it can only be applied to the Gemini 8m Telescopes once the Classical observing requirement has been fulilled and been in operation for a while. Nevertheless, the software and data structures to support classical observing which have to be present in a system that is only interactive at the start might require considerable redesign to be adapted later to the service observing requirement"
1995_gemini_PURE,"To achieve efficient service observing, queue observing, and ï¬exible scheduling, it should be possible to carry out observations automatically, in accordance with predefined sequences of exposures, as is commonly done in space observatories. This corresponds to what is meant by planned observing, which still requires competent monitoring at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site or remotely. At the same time, one does not want to lose the advantages and the extra ï¬exibility of ground-based astronomy. So whichever scheme is adopted to perform automatic sequences, interaction shall be allowed at the desired level (for example, only on error conditions, any time the user is allowed to break a sequence, etc.)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Flexible scheduling means the possibility of reacting to changes in weather and other conditions by allocating the current use of the telescope to the optimal observing program for those conditions. It will require the use of service and/or remote observing, as users cannot stay around indeinitely waiting for the conditions required by their program. This can be complemented by remote monitoring, if users can be on standby at a suitably equipped remote site. Flexible scheduling requires the possibility to change telescope scheduling quickly, exchanging observing programs. This can be achieved only with the help of appropriate scheduling software, which must advise the operations team on the best choice to make which is compatible with the relative priorities of the various observing programs. It should be recognized that such expert scheduling' software does not currently exist - it should be a requirement of such software that it have an operational mode which merely supports the decision making process by presenting appropriate information. Flexible scheduling requires switching during the night among telescope modes and instruments (typically 2 times per night). Thus ï¬exible scheduling is a superset of queue scheduling, with similar requirements."
1995_gemini_PURE,"These requirements apply to the commands and replies between sub-systems (including status information requests and replies), information to and from on-line databases, and commands and software for the IOCs."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The syntax of control commands is to be consistent across the system, whether accessing workstation software or IOC software. See Section 3.2.5 on page 3-6. All subsystems must respond to a common set of commands to test operational status, inquiries as to version, perform self-tests, etc. These common commands are described in Section 5.3 on page 5-2. All IOC subsystems must respond to additional common commands for such activities as start, stop, initialize, reset parameters, etc. These IOC common commands are described in Section 5.3 on page 5-2. The support structure for communicating commands must be reliable, with a uniform ACK/NAK protocol adopted across all systems. Timeouts must be supported at approximately 500 msec. Handshaking of commands between IOCs must occur within 100-200 msec, signaling acceptance of each command. For commands allowing delayed replies, timeouts for that reply must also be supported. Peak control information within the system is expected to be 100 TPS. This assumes bridging between communication sections, to isolate trafic in relevant sections only."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The following requirements apply to the control and transfer of astronomical data in all forms (science, engineering, reference, etc.)"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Data . Data from detectors must be stored in the most effective method permitted by available technology. Astronomical data is often detector readout limited so that disk access and data transfer times are not significant. Maximum acceptable readout time for detector data is very dependent on detector type and size as well as the intended application: For focusing and related activities, maximum acceptable detector readout time is about 0.1 sec, though only a portion of the detector may be read during that time. For mosaicked, large optical detectors, a full readout of the detector must be done in about 2 or 3 minutes. Concurrent data access and display. Since the Gemini system supports monitoring of operation, there must be the capability of providing multiple, simultaneous access to data. Data transfer between the virtual telescope system and attached workstations therefore imposes significant transfer requirements on the LAN. The LAN must support a transfer rate of 20-40 Mbits/second. Data acquisition format. Data is normally acquired as uncompressed data, but may be compressed using a loss-less compression technique for transmission from the Gemini system or across the system LAN. The goal of compression is to minimize bandwidth impact on the LAN and WAN and to save space on removable media. For data that requires preprocessing, such as infrared detector data, only the preprocessed data is stored. Storage of data. Data from all instruments and detectors is stored as compressed data, using a standard format. There is a define level of storage within IOCs, to secure data in the event of link failures.A second level of storage is on the Gemini system data disk(s), possibly also on removable media. Quick-look data quality assessment is done using this level. Archiving of data is automatically done while in observing and maintenance level operation to the Gemini Archive subsystem. Shipping of data to a central archive follows later. Data transmission format. Data is transmitted between Gemini and home Institutes using a FITS format and contains all header information provided with the data. System-wide data capacity. The data capacity of the system is limited by transfer methods and technology, as well as archiving capacity on site. The system data capacity is capable of retaining 7 days of data produced by the largest instrument, the last 3 days of which must be available interactively from hard disk or similar medium."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Video information originates from target acquisition, guiding, and site monitoring cameras. The requirements for transferring video data are: The system must allow for fast transmission of rough images every 0.5 sec. This may be assisted through the use of data-loss compression techniques (e.g. JPEG, MPEG, etc). In addition, there is the need for transmission of images matching the original resolution. This high-quality transmission must require less than 20 sec, and can only be assisted with loss-less compression."
1995_gemini_PURE,"To preserve the integrity of the system, there must be a system of privileges established at each operating level of the system. These privileges should be determined in a simple manner during logging into the system. Protection against accidental interference is to be implemented using an Access Mode Allocation system that dynamically identifies and assigns resources as needed. Critical resources (those that can support only a restricted number of simultaneous uses) are assigned solely through this allocation system. The allocation system must ensure that the system cannot remain deadlocked with respect to this resource allocation. Finally, procedures must be implemented for convenience and system integrity, to simplify and codify common tasks. The tasks that require such procedures include: Telescope start-up and shutdown Telescope system self-testing. Instrument start-up and shut-down. This is not permitted to interfere with telescope operation. Instrument self-testing and self-diagnosis This is not permitted to interfere with telescope operation Coniguration and reconiguration Dynamic reconiguration of observing coniguration (beam switching without restarting instruments and telescope). The control software should know what subsystems are installed and their status at all times."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The telescope and instrument software shall contain built-in test (BIT) facilities to verify Gemini 8m Telescopes system and Gemini 8m Telescopes software performances. Every Gemini 8m Telescopes software module shall have corresponding test specifications to check normal operation of releases, to be used both for acceptance tests and as an on-line test procedure. The Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall also provide for execution of self-test sequences of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system and subsystems. These shall automatically exercise all subsystems present in a given operational coniguration. Regression tests should be a part of every Gemini 8m Telescopes software package"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Subsystems must notify the user when faults occur. This notification must be specific as to origin and problem. The notification must also be capable of being electronically logged. It may also prove useful to have multiple levels of fault notification such as detailed, verbose, short, etc. to aid in tracking down problems."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Should a subsystem fail (e.g. one detector, one instrument) predefined procedures must exist to redefine the environment in such a way that operation can restart with the remaining equipment. In case of computer hardware failure concerning the user station equipment, it shall be possible to transfer control from one user station to another via a simple software reconiguration procedure. In the case of IOC failure, no transfer of control to another IOC will be possible, due to the local connections and interfaces to the control electronics. In this case there shall be a procedure to replace faulty cards and/or assemblies. If it is possible to observe with that particular IOC in a failed state (in general, this is limited to IOCs that are associated with individual scientific instruments) then it must be possible to reconigure the system to do so."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Full redundancy is not a requirement of the Gemini 8m Telescopes and it will be acceptable to have to replace units in case of failure. There are subsystems which are relatively inexpensive to support as redundant systems, such as telescope control computers. For each area where redundancy is decided to be cost effective, procedures for switching to the backup system will be established. There is no requirement for automatic switching to the backup system. All communication shall be based on the use of standard communication protocols, where retry procedures are applied (a form of software redundancy) as part of the protocol. Certain network concepts may be preferable as they offer intrinsic redundancy (e.g. double loops) and re-routing possibilities in case of node failures (single point failure protection)."
1995_gemini_PURE,The Gemini system software is designed under the following constraints.
1995_gemini_PURE,".There should be no restrictions imposed by the software on users. Only policy decisions (permissions, access privileges, etc.) should prevent any user from accessing any part of the Gemini system from any local or remote station. .Similar functionality should be presented to the users using similar user interfaces. However, user interfaces should clearly reï¬ect access modes and operating levels."
1995_gemini_PURE,Hardware constraints are covered in the individual chapters the Software Design Description.
1995_gemini_PURE,"There are a number of general constraints placed on the Gemini Software. These are: Commercial packages, off-the-shelf public domain software, and standards are to be used whenever feasible. Existing external software will be integrated with the Gemini software. The interfaces involved in this integration are considered part of the Gemini software system. All Gemini software is to be developed using standard methodologies and development environments. One of the goals of Gemini software is that all components be easily (preferably automatically) combined into an integrated system. Gemini software developers should maintain accurate change logs showing software modifications as they are applied to the system software. Gemini software developers should adhere to a standard method for the reporting and recording of errors from both internal and external sources. Gemini software should be developed in evolutionary fashion, using the CVS version control system All Gemini subsystem packages should include as part of the software both a simulator module for inclusion in the virtual telescope (see Design constraints, below), and user interface modules for the user interface environments that the subsystem will be operating in. The interfaces required of these user interface modules are described in Section 3.3 on page 3-6. All Gemini software is to be fully documented, internally with appropriate comments, and external documentation. External documentation must include Unix-style man pages. All Gemini subsystem packages must provide modules for the testing and diagnosis of the subsystem. All instrumentation control software must provide full access to all instrument functionality. It is likely that different user interface modules (see above) would present different portions of this functionality to the user. The information required of each interface module is found in the Functional Requirements specifications for each instrument. All Gemini software must be version labeled, both in source and binary form. The version information is to be retrievable from executing software via control commands."
1995_gemini_PURE,"There are different requirements for software running on different layers. For example, strict real-time control is restricted to the IOC layer. Also, the use of a virtual-telescope model in the Gemini system means that the integrated system can be tested and developed independently of the target hardware. This is useful not only in the use of the telescope simulator during science planning, but in maintenance and testing as well. Therefore all hardware subsystems must provide a software simulation module (as stated earlier) that responds in reasonable fashion to commands directed at that hardware. This simulation may require a standard environment, such as VxWorks, EPICS, and VME crate/cpu, but it cannot require any hardware specific to the application. .Gemini subsystem should be as self-contained and autonomous as possible, thereby decreasing the functional width of the interface to the rest of the Gemini system. No subsystem package should make any assumptions about the surrounding environment beyond that provided in the interface specifications."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The purpose of the Gemini 8m Telescopes software is the acquisition of astronomical data in digital form in the most efficient way. To achieve this, many other data concerning the telescope and instruments (parameters) and control commands will have to be exchanged between different processing units in order to setup and control telescope and instruments. Additionally, video and voice data are also necessary (for example, ield monitors)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Control information must be transferred, typically in the form of commands and replies from users, to telescope and instruments. Replies might contain status information and, in general, data concerning instruments and telescopes, to be stored together with the astronomical data. Control information on all controlled variables must be provided by all subsystems on request. No request for information shall produce a delay of control activities or locking, even if the corresponding equipment is not available or faulty. Delay times for the exchange of control information must stay within precise time limits to be defined in General Description in Chapter 2. One can afford to retransmit commands in case of transmission error or collision, but the protocol has to be predictable in that commands cannot get lost and replies have to come back reliably. In a number of cases, synchronization with the Time Reference System at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site is also necessary. Access to control parameters, telescope and instrument information for monitoring or other use makes a significant contribution to the control , and may be logged at quite high rates for short periods (i.e. up to 200 Hz for some information). It is explicitly required that all such information is available to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software and is capable of being available to all users of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, subject only to restrictions with respect to updating. It must also be possible to restrict user access to such information. In particular also, the meteorological information coming from a weather station should be available centrally."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Detector data must be acquired and stored in the most effective way technology will allow; effectiveness should be evaluated in terms of cost, space requirements, longevity, and speed. This shall lead to the Definition of a Gemini 8m Telescopes standard, used on all instruments. In general, operational overheads must be kept as low as possible, to maximize actual observing times. Intermediate storage of raw data in memory on different nodes and in different formats should be kept to a minimum. However, there must be at least two copies - one to secure data as acquired and one to do assessment of data quality on-line (this last copy preferably on removable media). The link chosen to transfer data should represent as small a bottleneck as possible for data acquisition."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Normally, raw data will be acquired and stored as such for quick look evaluations. There might, however, be cases (for example, infrared detectors) where fast preprocessing is needed and where, therefore, raw data will not be stored as such, but in a preprocessed format."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Astronomical data will have to be transported between GEMINI and the home institutes of visiting astronomers in FITS format (as defined by NOST 100-1.0, Definition of the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS), NASA Science Ofice of Standards and Technology)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"TV data concerning site monitoring and voice need to be capable of being available at all operations facilities. It will be a question of interfacing and bandwidth costs whether such information is actually available at a specific location. It is not a requirement that point to point video be available between Gemini 8m Telescopes operations facilities. It is a requirement that voice connectivity, perhaps point to point, be available on a permanent connection. Other astronomical information such as that coming from sky ield monitors, autoguider cameras and sky monitoring devices such as cloud and seeing monitors shall also be capable of being available."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Operation of telescope, instruments and subsystems can be carried out at three different levels. There will be parameters associated with each level of operation which define the status of the system and / or control the system. The specific access by different types of users to particular parameters of the different levels are given in Section 2.5.8 on page 25."
1995_gemini_PURE,"This is the normal operational mode. It allows a certain number of embedded tests, normally at a fairly high level. Monitoring is also done at this level. It is anticipated that all user categories have access to this level."
1995_gemini_PURE,"This allows maintenance tables (for example, with instrument parameters) to be updated. It is anticipated that the majority of parameters at this level will be accessed by operations and development staff."
1995_gemini_PURE,"This allows the installation and testing of new packages or new releases. Any low level test can be performed in this mode. It shall be possible to update all non-protected parameter values, i.e. those not used by operations at observing level. Access to this level will be extremely limited."
1995_gemini_PURE,Privileges and protections are also important parameters to define user operations.
1995_gemini_PURE,"A further subdivision within the levels can be achieved by implementing privileges associated with categories of users or with the location of the user station (local or remote). For example some users might only be allowed monitoring, as a subsystem is in use by someone else."
1995_gemini_PURE,Protections must also be enforced (see also Security in Section 3.5.6 on page 3- 20) among users and the operational software should indicate clearly to users the current operation level and check the compatibility between subsystems in different modes.
1995_gemini_PURE,"The capacity of the system can be expressed in terms of nodes, which is defined as the number of workstations, or in terms of users, which is defined as the sum total of users at all the nodes. The capacity requirements will be expressed in terms of nodes. Each node will have the capability to run at all operation levels. When the Gemini 8m Telescopes telescope is used in its normal observing mode, there will be a single operator node for the telescope and two data acquisition and instrument control nodes. OPERATION Some tests might be run in parallel on instruments that do not have the light beam at that moment, so in principle additional nodes might be working at the same time. The system will provide for one auxiliary data acquisition and instrument control nodes. In addition, the system must support off-site observing modes. The system will provide for a single off-site data acquisition and instrument control node - to be located at either the Gemini 8m Telescopes Site Support or Base Facility. One supervisor will monitor the system, and other users might need to monitor the running of observing programs, locally or remotely. The system will provide for a single local monitoring node and a single remote monitoring node. As a conclusion, the Gemini 8m Telescopes control software shall allow simultaneous operation of up to six active control nodes and up to two more monitoring nodes (one local and one remote) without appreciable degradation of performance. In practice the operation and facilities foreseen so far for the Gemini 8m Telescopes will limit this number to a maximum in the order of three active nodes, but the Gemini 8m Telescopes computers and software shall be capable of coping with the load of 10 active nodes, should the case arise"
1995_gemini_PURE,This section is intentionally kept at the level of performance criteria rather than response times (found in Section 2.11.2 on page 2- 22). Every command must be acknowledged in a positive or negative way before the occurrence of the corresponding action within given response times.
1995_gemini_PURE,"There must be automatic procedures to implement startup and shutdown of the telescope and instruments. These must allow startup and shutdown of instruments independently of the telescope and without affecting the telescope operation. Reconiguration procedures must exist, to change the observing environment. The Definition of the observing environments must be dynamic, i.e. feasible during operations without the need to restart everything. The same applies to the related light path. Operations staff have privileges to change the environment, meaning selecting a suitable combination of instrumentsThe operational software should know which subsystems are installed and operational at any given time."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The user interface defines the way users see the Gemini 8m Telescopes system. Given the large number of instruments, there can be many different stations which are active at the same time. It is essential for operational and maintenance reasons that, in spite of the obvious differences of the setups and commands available, the same philosophy is applied throughout. This calls for a homogeneous user interface, which can be achieved only by applying the same user interface tools to the whole project, providing the Gemini 8m Telescopes user interface's look and feel'. The user interface should not be seen as a package linked to a specific computer. Given the requirement to be able to access the Gemini 8m Telescopes from several points, the user interface should rather be seen as a package to be callable from a large number of stations, depending on where a user is. It should also be network transparent so that it does not matter where it is being run. The user interface tools shall be based on standards, defined in Section 4.2.5 on page 4- 7, which will be portable across different computer hardware platforms (Portable User Interface Toolkit). The intent of a portability requirement is to facilitate migrating existing and future Gemini systems to different hardware as the need arises. It is the current intent to limit the selection of computer hardware platforms to as few as is practical"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Main processor computer hardware requirements will be defined in the Hardware constraints (see Section 3.4.2 on page 3- 12). This section deals instead with external hardware interfaces, namely the ones from the microprocessors to the control electronics. The Definition of these terms is as follows: main processors - these are the computers with which the user interacts control electronics - these are the computers controlling the instruments microprocessors - these are computers embedded in the instrument (for instance a DSP or transputer required for array control functions, or special purpose controllers for the primary mirror support actuators)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Standard interfaces to the control electronics shall be available, in the form of: standard bus systems a standard set of interface cards to be used on all the subsystems and instruments a standard software skeleton running on the control electronics"
1995_gemini_PURE,"The existence of hardware standards is clearly essential for maintenance and repairs. It is also essential to avoid software duplication, and to simplify the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. Microprocessor software in particular tends to contain hardware specific software, though one should try to keep it as hardware independent as possible, isolating different software layers. The standard software must be adequate for the real-time requirements and must offer drivers to the standard electronics to be used on all the Gemini 8m Telescopes software subsystems and instruments. Links between electronics interfaces and main processors must meet the requirements imposed by the data specifications (see Section 3.1 on page 3- 1)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software covers all aspects of control and data acquisition related to the telescope, instruments, and auxiliary instrumentation. It also covers all the operational aspects of the Gemini 8m Telescopes, including on-line scheduling and rescheduling. There is also software which, although it will be interfaced to the Gemini 8m Telescopes, is referred to as external. The external software consists of: commercial software integrated into the Gemini 8m Telescopes software (e.g. DBMS) preexisting software used in the Gemini 8m Telescopes (e.g. image processing systems, star catalogues) software associated with visitor instrumentation embedded software dedicated to hardware control, but not communicating on-line with the other Gemini 8m Telescopes software (in general this would be microprocessor code)"
1995_gemini_PURE,The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must interface to the external software and clearly the interfaces are fully part of the Gemini 8m Telescopes software.
1995_gemini_PURE,"In order to make efficient use of the telescope, to support different observing modes, and to support the versatility requirements, some form of on-line image (or pixel) quick-look analysis is required. The following statements are proposed: It shall be possible to monitor the quality (image quality, spectral resolution, signal to noise, etc.) of the astronomical data as it comes in. Standard reduction procedures should be available for basic on-line calibrations of the observed data. Ultimately, one would like to have fully reduced and calibrated data at the end of the observations. Advanced pipeline procedures might make this feasible, at least for observations of a standard nature."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The above statements define the goal of quick-look analysis for the Gemini 8m Telescopes. Quick-look data processing should be provided on the Gemini 8m Telescopes, with procedures suitable for fast on-line data preprocessing. A prerequisite for this is that acquired data are made available as directly as possible in a common format, and that all additional data related to an exposure and logging information are made available on-line at the same time. Quick-look should be usable within exposure sequences to provide results and feedback parameters to the control software in a programmed way, without the need for manual intervention. This document does not try to be specific about the requirements for Quick-look other than that it should be synchronous. Near-line processing should be available for simple data reductions required for data integrity validation (i.e. remove instrument and observatory effects so the observer can make decisions about further observing actions). This data reduction proceeds sequentially through requests, but asynchronously from data acquistion. In particular, data acquisition takes precedence over near-line data reduction. Off-line pixel processing for full data reduction should also exist at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, but does not have any interface to the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. The Astronomical communities have made considerable investments in image processing software, and therefore, compatibility with and adaptations to these packages must be sought. EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS It should also be noted that some Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystems, such as adaptive optics, may require their own special on-line pixel processing software, which is better defined in the requirements for those subsystems. This is largely due to the dificulty of applying on-line the same algorithms used for full off-line reductions  in general due to the time critical nature of the image processing needs. The same situation might also occur with other instruments, where specific observer support software has to be foreseen for on-line use. In all these cases the specific on-line (quick-look) software development shall be seen as a subset of the development for the off-line data reduction system, to avoid as far as possible duplication of development effort."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The output format of the Gemini 8m Telescopes data must be compatible with the GEMINI archive requirements. As comparisons with previous data might be of great value and affect the actual observing program, on-line interactive access to the data archiving system should exist, so that access to this database is possible for Gemini 8m Telescopes users. The specific types of data available; ï¬at ields, calibrations, science exposures, etc.; the amount of a specific exposure available; header only, averaged exposure, complete raw data set; and the time frame within which such data will be made available; same night, weekly, after proprietary period; will be established by the Gemini Archiving Requirements. Computer access to star catalogues is also required, so that an automatic selection of candidate guide and standard stars can be made."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software must be able to interface with all commercial software packages available on the Gemini 8m Telescopes and integrated into the Gemini 8m Telescopes operation. A relevant example of such a package is a general database management system (DBMS), where operational information such as schedules, logs, problem reports and maintenance information related to various pieces of equipment should be kept.Being in itself a distributed telescope system and having a large number of instruments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes system has internal communication needs"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Being in itself a distributed telescope system and having a large number of instruments, the Gemini 8m Telescopes system has internal communication needs."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The LAN shall support the majority of the Gemini 8m Telescopes system internal communication needs. This LAN must be capable of dealing both with the data bandwidths required (at peak and on average) and with the required response times and synchronization needs. This LAN shall be supplemented with a Local Time Bus, for distribution of absolute and relative time signals, and both a digital reï¬ective memory bus and an analog event-based bus, for distribution of signals with requirements not satisied by a LAN. Independently of the physical layout of such a network, its functional requirements can be split into several categories: Local coordination and synchronization needs within a subsystem (for example, coordination of active support system for primary mirror, bi-directional trafic of commands/replies). This layer could be considered as internal to a given subsystem or instrument, but as more than one subsystem might need it, one should aim for a unique solution at the hardware and software level. Global synchronization needs, such as the universal time synchronization requirement. The required accuracy will be defined in Section 2.9 on page 2- 19. Exchange of control information, in the form of commands and status information. (Bi-directional trafic) (see also Section 3.1.1 on page 3- 1). ¢Collection and transfer (for archiving or remote access) of raw astronomical Access from Wide Area Network (WAN) for remote diagnostics and monitoring from operations facilities (Bi-directional trafic)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"No distinction is made here between WAN and point to point links as there shall be no difference in the software between the two cases. However the system architecture will be designed so as to minimize the communication load placed on peer and higher level networks. Control data and astronomical data have already been defined in the Data specifications (see Section 3.1 on page 3- 1). The reason for repeating them here is to have a complete view of the required network functionality.To eliminate conceptual access problems, while coping with different bandwidths, LAN and WAN interfaces shall be homogeneous and shall be based on standards which allow migration on different media, should they become required during the Gemini 8m Telescopes project life. For maintenance reasons and hardware independence, a clear hierarchical model must be implemented, supporting separation of logical and physical layers, e.g. ISO/OSI model. It is recognized that this hierarchy may need to be violated for (in general) performance reasons. This results in point-to-point connections between peer systems or direct connections bypassing the hierarchy. Network redundancy should also be considered in the design phase as a way to increase reliability and security, in particular for control information. Due to the uncertain future of the Internet, only non-essential tasks may employ it. All essential tasks, not including remote observing, must take place on resources controlled by the project (such as leased lines). Violation of the hierarchical nature of the system can lead to testing and maintenance problems. The use of these features must be limited and constrained by the following guidelines: Peer-to-peer connectivity should only be used to overcome a demonstrated performance problem. Bypassing the hierarchy (connected between grandmother and granddaughter with no path through the mother) should only be used for transmission of status information or bulk data, not control "
1995_gemini_PURE,"It is envisaged that observing astronomers who have travelled to the Gemini 8m Telescopes site will make use of the Gemini 8m Telescopes control room facilities. This will allow centralized support and coordination of their operations, providing both operations support for individual instruments and supervision for all of them. However, even at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site there will be users (e.g. software development and maintenance staff) installing or enhancing other parts of the system, possibly working directly at the telescope. Finally, in the case of remote operations, other users (e.g. support staff) might be on Cerro Tololo or in Hilo. To allow coordination both locally at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site between the various users and with remote users, the software shall support access to the system from any user station. It will then be an operational decision, implying privileges and priorities for the various categories of users, and Definition of what a given user can actually do. Access from any user station will make user stations in principle identical and software conigurable as the user station of this or that subsystem. This should greatly simplify the coordination problem posed by the large number of simultaneous users (as already described in the Capacity requirements, Section 3.2.2)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"There are a number of constraints for the Gemini 8m Telescopes computer hardware. Although some of these constraints may appear redundant the project recognizes that: during the next 5 to 10 years new hardware will be available with features and costs that could beneit the project the hardware chosen as the standard at this point of time may be no longer available at some point in the future the cost of maintaining an existing hardware standard, even if available, may exceed the costs of adopting a new hardware standard"
1995_gemini_PURE,"These constraints recognize that the majority of the expense in changing hardware standards is the cost of the software. Particular constraints are: Computers used at the Gemini 8m Telescopes site, particularly in the test phase when they are outside the control room and near the subsystem under test, shall be checked against altitude and humidity specifications for the Gemini 8m Telescopes site (see also [EDS] in Section 1.3). Computer hardware must be able to run the Gemini 8m Telescopes software environment (operating systems, Gemini 8m Telescopes software) and provide compatibility in data format (identical internal data representation). .Common development and implementation tools must be both available and supported Identical network access must be supported .Local processing power must be such that telescope and instrument control does not represent a significant overhead in the whole process of executing an observing program (the overhead, if any, should be limited by the time it takes for physical devices to act) The choice of a scalable hardware architecture with computers at various performance levels should solve the problem of adequate on-line data assessment, as the amount of this activity is very variable and dependent upon the kind of detector and method used. .Due to the limited bandwidths which may be available remotely, there will be constraints on the functionality of remote operations and access."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Depending on funding, it is probably reasonable here to make a minimum and a desirable specification. The minimum situation could also coincide with what is needed in the test period before coming to full remote operation. In any case, remote operation must include remote monitoring from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facilities, together with access tools for diagnostic and test use. It should be a goal to support remote observing from the Gemini 8m Telescopes base facilities."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Some of the general requirements which have a direct effect on the software are here explicitly transformed into software constraints. These are: Individual instruments must be able to run fully independently. Telescope software at the two telescopes must be maintained to be identical in the upper layers (even if hardware should differ). Additions of new instruments should aim, as a goal, at introducing no modification to already operational parts. Modifications should be conined to the operational procedures and should not affect the bulk of the existing software. .Switching to different conigurations must be possible at any time with appropriate procedures. There must be easy procedures to reconigure the system when subsystems are modified or removed. The number of main packages of software must be kept to a minimum to facilitate maintenance, but compatibly with the need to have the right degree of modularity. Commercial and public domain packages should be used whenever possible. Existing software packages should be reused wherever possible. Existing software expertise should be consulted whenever possible. All software which does not directly control specific hardware must be written as machine independent, portable code. Even for microprocessor software, the software should be hardware independent, to allow a later choice of the target microprocessors. To allow for expansion and maintenance, Gemini 8m Telescopes standards must be defined for the on-line software and the development environment. On-line version control must be implemented. That is, the version control system must be available to recover/restore versions at all times. .At boot time, the Gemini 8m Telescopes software shall check the consistency of versions of all the various software components. .Table-driven software should be used whenever possible, to avoid unnecessary compilations."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Whether the software is table driven, message driven, or a combination of both is a function of the individual work packages and defined in the appropriate work package description. Changing system constants, such as arcseconds/bit for an encoder, shall not require recompiling but will be updated as part of system startup, and, for some constants, will be modifiable during operation. System status parameters will be maintained to an extent that will allow restarting the system and regaining the previous state. The extent of duplication of the previous state will be dictated by safety and practical considerations. Strict checking should be applied on this to preserve maintainability and reconiguration of the system."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Regardless of application, the software and control systems produced as part of the Gemini Project Work Packages exhibit numerous common attributes. The specific attributes described in this document are: Simplicity Supportability Reliability and Availability Maintainability Human Engineering Security and Safety Environmental Compatibility Testability Expandability Modularity Concurrency"
1995_gemini_PURE,A supportability plan will be part of the Gemini Control System. The goals and issues to be addressed by this plan and the elements of the plan are detailed below. The plan is TBD.
1995_gemini_PURE,have supportability inï¬uence design translate availability and readiness requirements into supportability requirements identify and plan for necessary support provide support at minimum cost
1995_gemini_PURE,maintenance personnel availability and work hour constraints personnel skill level constraints operating and support cost constraints target failures correctable at each maintenance level allowable downtime at site turnaround time to ix and maintain system standardization requirements
1995_gemini_PURE,"maintenance planning manpower and personnel supply support support equipment technical data training and training support computer resources support facilities packaging, handling, storage and transportation design interface"
1995_gemini_PURE,A reliability program is part of the Gemini Control System. The requirements for this program and some measures of reliability are detailed below. The plan is as provided by Glen Heriot of the Canadian Gemini Project Ofice.
1995_gemini_PURE,"Reliability is defined as The duration or probability of failure-free performance under state conditions or The probability that an item can perform its intended function for a specified interval under stated conditions. The [GSR] sets as a requirement 2% and a goal 1% for total system (mechanical, electrical, and software) downtime due to failures - this translates to a maximum of 15 minutes per night or 1 night per month of downtime. This in turn sets quite stringent requirements on both MTBF and MTTR for the software and controls. To guarantee maximum availability of the control system, retry procedures must be embodied in the software in case of error or failure (e.g. time-out, hardware failure) to achieve recovery on-line whenever possible. Should recovery also fail, the error or failure has to be reported in a clear form (to identify the cause of the problem) and the system shall put itself into a safe state, whenever a safety aspect might be involved. To avoid unnecessary downtime, it must be possible for the system to reconigure itself in order to continue observing, in a different mode if required, given the failure of a single non-critical subsystem.To increase software robustness, range checking and validity checking shall be supported before execution of any input command. This must be possible ahead of time, preparing observing sequences for automatic observations and simulating observations to estimate results. On-line pre-checking of the operational status of equipment should be done prior to sending critical or time consuming commands. It must be possible to apply continuous monitoring to all subsystems on request, both when in operation and when idle, to check their operational status. A measure of fault rates should be done during commissioning to establish baseline rates for system reliability monitoring. There are to be recovery procedures to restart after error failure. The system should be constantly monitoring active subsystems to be sure they are operating correctly before sending command to each subsystem. This monitoring should continue on inactive subsystems. The goal for recover and/or reconiguration is 5 minutes from onset of the error condition to observing again. specific requirements are: measurable, realistic reliability needs performance criteria for the system Definition of failure conditions of use and environments means of verification period of time during system life"
1995_gemini_PURE,A detailed plan for maintaining and periodically upgrading the Control System over its lifetime will be part of the Gemini Control System. The plan will consider: Maintenance requirements including an estimate of required resources. The method of upgrading the system to add capabilities and performance. Areas where upgrades are anticipated should be identified with an estimate of the required effort and resources.
1995_gemini_PURE,These issues will be addressed in the context of the mountain environment where the system will be operating. The plan will be delivered with the control system
1995_gemini_PURE,"Maintenance of commercial software (Solaris, VxWorks) used by this work package is the responsibility of the WPR and the maintenance costs are not covered by the work package budget. Community software support (EPICS) is available nominally free-of-charge through the normal release and bug-ix procedures used in the community. All subsystem software is to include modules to aid in the maintenance and testing of the subsystem. For example, each subsystem is to include a simulator that provides a reference behavior for that subsystem. Simple mechanisms should exist for replacing a subsystem with its simulation. The following self-check levels are to be supplied with sub-system software: Monitor level Each subsystem should have a background task running whenever that subsystem is operational, performing such tasks as checking power supply levels, temperatures, performance, correct responses to commands. The OCS is to be notified of any detected problems. Self-test level. Each subsystem should provide a module for fully exercising all subsystem components, both hardware and software. This module is executed automatically during start-up and on demand through the defined interface. Problems are to be automatically reported to the OCS via the defined interface. System level. There are also software modules for testing the subsystem as an integrated portion of the entire system. This software would be executed on demand during maintenance operation level."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Quantitative maintenance requirements will be allocated to the system, subsystems, and each component. The requirements must be achievable and stated in such a way that verification is permitted. The requirements will be expressed as: Mean Time to Repair for each maintenance level Maximum Time to Repair for each maintenance level Preventative Maintenance hours per year"
1995_gemini_PURE,All equipment shall support a programmed adjustment and maintenance interval of 30 days or longer
1995_gemini_PURE,All Gemini Software must be designed with human engineering requirements under consideration. The human engineering requirements for Gemini Software include: provisions for minimizing stress effects and fatigue feedback on operation on specific tasks people and machine interfaces procedures training and experience interaction with team members management and organizational behavior
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Gemini Control System development effort will obey and abide by both the letter and the spirit of all applicable engineering practices, laws, regulations, and policies. All necessary safety approvals will be obtained before devices will be accepted. The safety precedents and requirements are detailed below."
1995_gemini_PURE,"MIL-STD-822B, System Safety Program Requirements, defines safety and risk as: Safety: Freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, or damage to or loss of equipment or property Risk: An expression of the possibility of a mishap in terms of hazard severity and hazard probability"
1995_gemini_PURE,"In addition the Gemini project defines a hazard as: Hazard: Something that could cause death, injury, illness, or damage/loss."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Gemini system must be self-monitoring to invoke safety monitoring to prevent risk to people or damage to equipment. The software should be able to quickly bring the Gemini system to a safe state upon notification of such danger. Subsystems must be able to detect such danger and report it appropriately. In the event that the risk persists, subsystems must be able to move themselves into safe states to protect people and equipment (i.e. if there is a failure in the higher-level systems). Safety protection must be applied whenever there is the risk that the actions of the control software could endanger people or cause damage to any Gemini 8m Telescopes subsystem, for example, by driving beyond limits or by overexposing detectors. This protection, where implemented, must be independent of the software. In general this will require mechanical hard stops, electrical interlocks, electrical hard limit switches, soft limit switches, software limits, and watch dogs,. The order in which these systems will work is as follows: software limits - the software will not allow unsafe actions; the command will be rejected soft limit switches - the software will detect unsafe areas and halt; the software will allow movement off of soft limits software watch dogs - the software will halt if its watch dog has not been reset hardware watch dogs - the system will halt if its watch dog has not been reset hard limit switches - these switches will remove power from actuator when beyond soft limits; the software/electrical systems will allow movement off of hard limits hardware interlocks - these will prevent both software and hardware from action - there will be no bypass of these systems hard stops - the mechanism cannot move beyond this point due to mechanical limit(s). In general hard stops will use dampers to avoid damage to equiment."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software shall be able to bring the Gemini 8m Telescopes system quickly to a safe state upon detection of danger. Safety aspects shall be analyzed during the functional specification phase of the software. Security must be provided in order to both prevent accidental mix-up of commands from different users on different parts of the system and to prevent intrusion from the wide area network into the Gemini 8m Telescopes. In particular, the astronomical database must be protected from intrusion, whether the purpose is to access private data or to be destructive. It is acceptable, and may well prove to be the best solution, to provide intrusion security by a well designed network gateway acting as a irewall. A system that is operating in Engineering/Maintenance mode must ignore directives from other systems, though status information should still be provided for use by other systems. There should be security preventing the intrusion into the system by unauthorized users, or users at unauthorized access levels. All systems are appropriately interlocked. This interlock must not depend on any software for reliable operation. Details of the interlock system are found in the Mount Control System Work Package Definition. The interlock philosophy is as follows: All hazards capable of causing death and/or loss of irreplacable equipment shall be passively interlocked. All hazards capable of causing injury and/or severe damage to equipment shall be actively interlocked (severe damage implies that repairs are not repairable at the depot level All other hazards may be interlocked via software."
1995_gemini_PURE,The precedence for conforming to safety requirements will be: design for minimum risk incorporate safety devices provide warning devices develop procedures and training
1995_gemini_PURE,"The general safety requirements are: eliminate hazards through design, including material selection isolate hazardous substances from people minimize hazard to people during operation and maintenance from high voltage, electromagnetic radiation, sharp edges, hot surfaces, chemicals, etc. minimize risks due to environmental conditions, such as temperature, noise, vibration, etc. minimize risks created by human error use interlocks and other protective devices when hazards cannot be eliminated provide distinctive markings and warnings to protect people"
1995_gemini_PURE,"A Controls Test Plan is part of the Gemini Control System. This plan will address all areas of testing from design, acceptance, commissioning through to hand-over. The objectives and requirements of this plan are detailed below. MIL-STD-1309C, Definitions of terms for Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment, has these Definitions: Testability: A design characteristic which allows the status of a unit to be conidently determined in a timely fashion. Built-in-test: An integral capability of the mission equipment which provides an onboard, automated test capability to detect, diagnose, or isolate system failures. The fault detection and, possibly, isolation capability is used for periodic or continuous monitoring of a system's operational health, and for observation and, possibly, diagnosis as a prelude to maintenance action."
1995_gemini_PURE,The major objectives are: test effectively with minimum effort and cost reduce maintenance induced problems reduce the cost of test equipment and programming reduce cost of documentation testability requirements
1995_gemini_PURE,The interpretation of this table is that we should discover the failure of a subsystem 90% of the time before the failure impacts observing.
1995_gemini_PURE,"Since the Gemini software will be developed in stages over a period of years, and since computer technology is expected to evolve rapidly over this same period, the software is to be designed to be easily extended and upgraded with modifications to non-changing components. The software itself, its installation process, and its documentation must be developed with this expandability in mind, using general industry standards."
1995_gemini_PURE,"All software is to be developed using typical modularization and standardization techniques. In particular, each module's environment is strictly defined by its interface to other components. No module can rely upon information outside of this interface. Module selection should be done in logical fashion to minimize the size of the interfaces between modules. The on-line databases can be considered part of this interface, but are only accessible through their defined interfaces. The software must be strictly modular, i.e. the functionality of a subsystem should correspond to that which belongs to that subsystem and only to that, so that software for different subsystems can be installed and maintained independently of all the rest.This is needed in particular for multi-instrument operation, for example, as instruments share the same subsystems on the telescope. At the same time, the possibility must exist to acquire information about other parts of the system (for example, telescope coordinates) (as mentioned in the control requirements in Section 3.1.1). It also important that there are no undesired interactions between subsystems. This may be enforced either at the client/server interface or at the message system level."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Fault tolerance. The security and safety of the system should be guaranteed even in the event of failure of any component, including the higher-level software. Redundancy. Hardware redundancy is a not requirement of the Gemini systems. However, the ability to reconigure the software if one actuator fails is desirable. Data redundancy is also a requirement, to prevent a single failure from causing the loss of collected data. The goal is to minimize the effects of single-point errors throughout the system."
1995_gemini_PURE,"As much as possible, the system is to take advantage of parallel operation to improve eficiency. The Telescope Control System should be capable of detecting and invoking parallel operation as it is responsible for control of all of the telescope and enclosure subsystems."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Gemini 8m Telescopes software has to be developed according to a structured and formally defined development model. The purpose of this is to: make the development process visible (for quality and maintenance reasons) avoid incomplete specifications discover errors early (via review and audit procedures) secure structured, maintainable software guarantee software quality improve and ease cooperation."
1995_gemini_PURE,"This has to be defined in [SMP] and [SCP] (see Applicable Documents, Section 1.3), which will cover: Development methods Formal approval, review and audit procedures Documentation Coding and debugging Simulation Component and integration-verification and testing Coniguration and version management."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The development environment for the Gemini 8m Telescopes software consists of the computer hardware and system software (operating system, languages and tools) chosen optimally to support the development model presented in the previous section on life-cycle aspects. The choice of such an environment has to be defined, together with the choice of all the Gemini 8m Telescopes standards, but excluding the target computer hardware, in Section 4.2.5 on page 4- 7. The following criteria for later selection shall be kept in mind: Emphasis on development and productivity requirements, including cross support tools Portability of software (target hardware independence) Hardware and vendor independence Use of industrial and defacto standards."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Test procedure methods have to be defined in the Software Test Plan (STP), while test plans shall be written for all individual software packages and modules comprising the Gemini 8m Telescopes software. Apart from the component and integration test procedures, a formal release system should exist at package and module level, which should be checkable on-line by the operational procedures for consistency. Every system must thus be able to supply its current version upon request. The test operation level has already been discussed in Section 3.2.1 on page 3- 3. The phasing of the various parts of the project is given in the [SMP]."
1995_gemini_PURE,This section presents the specific attributes and requirements for Gemini software. Only the high-level requirements for Gemini software are presented here. Detailed specifications for the subsystems are found in the individual chapters of the Software Design Description.
1995_gemini_PURE,"Regardless of application, the Gemini software exhibits numerous common attributes. These attributes are described in this section."
1995_gemini_PURE,The Gemini system maintenance philosophy is described in the Software Management Plan (SMP). Preventative maintenance is scheduled as specified in the Gemini Design Requirements specification.
1995_gemini_PURE,"All software is to be developed using typical modularization and standardization techniques. In particular, each module's environment is strictly defined by its interface to other components. No module can rely upon information outside of this interface. Module selection should be done in logical fashion to minimize the size of the interfaces between modules. The on-line databases can be considered part of this interface, but are only accessible Reliability and availability A measure of fault rates should be done during commissioning to establish baseline rates for system reliability monitoring. There are to be recovery procedures to restart after error failure. See section Section 3.2.5 on page 3 - 5. During science planning, there should be validity and feasibility checks to help ensure effective and efficient use of the telescope. Where appropriate, these checks should also be performed during operation. The system should be constantly monitoring active subsystems to be sure they are operating correctly before sending commands to each subsystem. This monitoring should continue on inactive subsystems."
1995_gemini_PURE,"All telescope and instrument parameters are kept in an on line database to permit easy implementation of table-driven applications. The interface between software control packages is normally done via interface calls to the on-line database. The requirements for this database package are: .All telescope, instrument, and detector control information is to be available at any operation level. Access times to the database are to be in the range of 2-3 msec per access. Asynchronous writes are to be supported, allowing for concurrent operation. Time-access critical information is available in memory. There is to be a consistent and logical (i.e. name based) access method. The database must support both remote access and distributed data."
1995_gemini_PURE,The internal (within the IOC) implementation of this database is to be based on EPICS. The implementation within the host workstation is TBD.
1995_gemini_PURE,"A fundamental criteria of Gemini telescope operation is that it support a full implementation of remote operations. This includes remote observing, remote control of telescope, enclosure, and instruments, multipoint monitoring, remote monitoring, remote access for testing, development, diagnostics, and maintenance, It is expected that all operational capability found in on site operations is extended to remote operations, with some degradation in performance resulting from WAN bandwidth considerations. This means the video data signals must be encoded digitally and transferred via the WAN to remote sites. There must be some form of security to control access to system features, possibly restricting some operations to specific remote sites (e.g. Hale Pohaku or Hilo in Hawaii, Cerro Tololo in Chile, etc.)"
1995_gemini_PURE,"The various types of data were presented earlier. This section examines the input, output, and interrelationships of the various data types."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Final storage locations for the data types is presented here, along with a description of the different databases that are available. The on-line data store holds astronomical data for the current observation. Astronomical data are automatically stored onto the Archive medium (external software). Star catalogs are available in Astronomical object catalogs (external software). Telescope and instrument parameters are distributed in databases across the IOCs for those systems. There is also a central repository maintained by the OCS that holds these databases for down-loading to the IOCs. (developed software) All additional data that is not required on line (coniguration information, detailed documentation, operation logs, etc.) are stored in a relational DBMS. (supported software)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Input data are all data that are predefined at operation start. This includes catalogs, calibrations and ï¬at ields available in archives, etc. Observing commands (whether entered interactively or via the Sequencer) are input data that provide information on the course of operation and trigger events."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Replies to commands, including status information, updates to parameters, video and astronomical information are considered data outputs. These data end up in the different databases. Operational information, such as logging messages, alarms, and errors are special forms of output data, since they are made available for later inspection and debugging."
1995_gemini_PURE,"One criteria is that suficient information be recorded during an observation to recreate the sequence of events that occurred during the observation. This requires that all input and output data be logged appropriately. Given an initial set of coniguration parameters, the Gemini system operates via a sequence of commands. This operation is complemented by using previously stored data, calibrations, and star catalogs"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Automatic operation. This is the normal mode of operation. The observation is performed through a preplanned program requiring little or no interaction with the observer. Interactive operation. Science planning and program changes are accomplished through interactive operation. Is is possible to enter interactive operation from automatic operation to handle exceptional conditions.This is the normal mode of operation at maintenance and test levels. Modes and control. Normal operation is possible at all operation levels (observing, maintenance, and test) and applies to the following conditions (where appropriate) on any subsystem: Observing Stand-by Maintenance and testing Performance. Overall performance of the Gemini telescope is defined as the percentage of viewable time during which exposures have been taken (i.e. sum of all exposure times over available time for exposures). To improve this performance, all possible concurrencies in system operation should be used. Best use of concurrency occurs when using the Sequencer. Start-up and shut-down. There are start-up and shut-down procedures that must exist at many different levels: Cold start-up, starting the system from scratch (including time to download all software) should take about 5 minutes. This does not include time to start-up the telescope or instruments. Warm start-up, starting from scratch but also excluding software download time should take about 1 minute. Telescope start-up, measured from end of cold or warm start-up should be about 4 minutes. Instrument start-up, measured from end of telescope start-up, should take 2 minutes or less.There must be a way to shut down all subsystems (hardware and software). All start-ups and shut-downs are to be automatically logged with time stamps, to allow for statistics on system availability. Logging System logging information should include all important events, properly timestamped and indexed. The goal is to be able to recreate the steps in a observation from the system logs. Engineering Logging It must be possible to log engineering data at up to 200 Hz rates for short periods of time. This data must be available to external software packages for analysis. Long-term logging of engineering data must be possible at slower (1 Hz or less) rates, into a common format (baselined as SYBASE)."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Fault-tolerance and recovery See Attributes, Section 4.1 on page 4 - 1. Error logging. There are three types of errors: Fatal Fatal errors occur if there is no acceptable recovery procedure that will allow operation to proceed. Under fatal error conditions, the system falls back to a safe ""backup"" state requiring human intervention for restart. Serious Under serious errors, the system does not need to move off-line, but the current operation cannot be completed. Serious errors require human intervention to restart full operation. Warning All other unexpected conditions result in warnings that are properly logged. The system continues operation, though perhaps with reduced eficiency. All subsystems must group errors into these categories. In addition, errors that result in an ""alarm"" should be described, along with the proper action required to acknowledge and eliminate the alarm condition. Besides the time-stamp, error logging should provide enough information to trace the condition back to its apparent source, both in equipment and in event sequence. There should be tools available to extract error (and other) logging information by subsystem component, time- sequence, previous events, and so on. The Gemini Control System formally distinguishes alarms from errors. Errors result from failures to successfully complete commands, while alarms represent asynchronous failures. Note that an error may result in an alarm.There are two types of alarm conditions. The define are automatically monitored alarms, which exist as long as the errors persist and are then automatically cleared. The second type of alarm require human acknowledgment to clear. Recovery In addition to start-up procedures, there must be well-defined recovery procedures for any subsystem that has become inoperative. Command retries must be included in the system for most common timeouts or noresponse conditions. These retries should occur automatically in the command handling to avoid unnecessary error conditions. Performance The performance of error-mode recovery is specific to the subsystem and is defined in the Functional specification for that subsystem. Normally, there is no recovery possible from a fatal error except to shut-down and then restart the subsystem. However, in the case of an instrument failure, it may be possible to continue operation by rescheduling to use observations that do not require that particular instrument For serious errors, it may be possible to continue operation with degraded performance. For example, failure of automatic tracking may require manual tracking; other errors may result in operation with a different instrument Under normal conditions, the number of warnings should be small. The system should monitor the rate of warning messages since an increase might indicate that some tuning or maintenance is appropriate. Ideally, such conditions should be noted by the subsystems before reaching the OCS level. Failure conditions should not cascade. That is, failure of one subsystem should not affect other, working, subsystems, including communication links."
1995_gemini_PURE,"All Gemini supported software is to be developed using a formally defined model. The Ward/Mellor approach to developing real-time systems is used and covers: Analysis, design and development methods Review procedures Documentation Coding and debugging Simulation Testing and integration"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Functional analysis is done using a CASE tool suitable for use with Ward/Mellor techniques, such as TSEE, by Westmount Technologies. The design is to use the techniques and diagrams introduced by Ward and Mellor and reviewed by the Gemini staff. Detailed design and development standards are not specified, but expected to conform to system goals and established practice. An object-oriented approach is encouraged but not required."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The upper levels (User-interface and OCS) are assumed to not require a real-time operating environment. However, the operating environment at these levels is expected to provide suficient performance for both human interaction and communications. Real-time support is required at the IOC level. Development system software. The choice for a development environment is based on the following criteria: Productivity and development tools Software portability and hardware independence Vendor independence Industry and de-facto standards Support for state-of-the-art user interfaces Support of a distributed environment Given these criteria, the following recommendations exist. The development operating system is UNIX System V, Release 4, using only POSIX compliant calls to the operating system. In particular, vendor specific extensions are not permitted. Compliance to POSIX is measured against the book: POSIX Programmer's Guide - Writing Portable UNIX Programs, by Donald Lewine, O'Reilly & Associates, Inc. 1991. Any special needs that cannot be acceptably met by the available operating system calls are to be discussed with the GPO on a case-by-case basis. Some packages (such as GUI interfaces and database interfaces) have higher portability requirements that may require the specification of higher level interfaces to the OS. The GUI systems are to use X-windows, version 11, release 5 (X11R5) or release 6 (X11R6). The principle language for developing GUIs is Tcl/Tk. The GNU software tool suite should be used where possible. Imake is recommended, with GNU's autoconigure utility an acceptable alternative. CVS is the recommended version control system. IOC and cross-development system software. A number of real-time operating systems were examined for compatibility with the goals for the Gemini Project. At the same time, the availability of cross-support development environments was considered. The recommendations are: The IOCs will use the real-time operating system VxWorks (from Wind River Systems). The communication interface between the IOCs and Unix workstations is to be IMP. It is assumed that all IOC software is to be developed on Unix workstations in a windowed development environment. The cross-compiler to be used for IOC software development is one specified by the Gemini Project. It is the GNU cc compiler as furnished with VxWorks. IOC software development is to be done using a common development environment, as specified in the Software Programming Standards (SPS) Software below the IOC level. There is likely to be software below the IOC level, but it should not require downloading, except possibly for upgrades, typically being placed into ROM or FLASH memory. Any access to this embedded software while it is connected to the system is strictly through software in the IOC. From outside the IOC this software appears as part of the electronics. Although this software is not considered part of the Gemini software, it is obviously an advantage (for maintenance purposes) to have it conform to the requirements of Gemini software. Installation system software The host workstation operating system is Unix, currently baselined as Solaris 2.3 or above. The installed target IOC operating system is VxWorks, with EPICS as the interface."
1995_gemini_PURE,Details of these standards can be found in the Software Programming Standards document.
1995_gemini_PURE,"The following recommendations are made: Communication hardware independence is accomplished by using the DARPA TCP/IP communication protocol over LAN's and the WAN. The communication software must support the standard ARPA services (telnet, FTP, SMTP, etc) as well as NFS, RPC, IPC, and the Unix socket interface library."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The recommendations are: .The software interface between workstation and IOC is to use DRAMA's IMP protocol for all control communication, using SDS as the command structure.. .Interprocess communication on the host workstations is through the same IMP protocol. .Communications between real-time components is to based on the EPICS Channel Access protocol. Data communications are typically through IMP/SDS Further details of the software interfaces are found in the Software Design Description."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Off line Data reduction. The off-line data reduction facility is not considered part of the Gemini software. However, it will be possible to connect such software into the Gemini system if interface routines are developed for connecting to the Gemini system. These interface routines are part of the Gemini software and must conform to the standards given in this document. Packages that might be used for off-line data reduction include ADAM, IRAF, Midas, IDL and Khoros. Quick-look analysis will be through PV-Wave/IDL. Archiving. All astronomical data are saved into the Archiving system. Data storage and transport for astronomical data will be in FITS format. On-line access to the archiver will be through STARCAT. .Star catalogs. The catalogs available on the Gemini system are described in TBD, as are software access requirements. Both on-line and off-line access is done according to STARCAT."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Astronomical data are stored both in the Archiving system and in the data storage subsystem. IOC control databases are distributed across the IOC subsystems, with down-loadableinitialization copies available on the Gemini disks. Coniguration, logging, maintenance schedules, and subsystem documentation are to be kept in the commercial relational database."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Only the development systems are considered here. Installed systems are to be chosen later, based on available technology and experiences with the development systems."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The computer hardware used for development must conform to the following: Workstations must match specified software standards and present a well-designed development environment, including cross-support for VxWorks development, if needed. .Workstations are expected to be state-of-the-art systems (CPU, communications support) in a scaleable family. This allows the migration of development systems to advancing technology. .It is assumed that workstations support Ethernet IEEE-802.3 and FDDI interfaces for communications. Internal data formats must be compatible across workstations used for development. SCSI-interface peripherals are to be available. .Reliability, manufacturer support, and upgrade capability of the development systems will be considered when selecting the target systems."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The following recommendations are made: Workstations Where Gemini is providing the computer equipment as part of a contractual agreement, the developmental workstations are to be SUN SPARC-10 (model 41) or SPARC Classic with 64MB of dynamic memory. Internal Gemini software development is done in a multi-platform environment, enabling selection of target machines to be made based on experiences with development equipment. Peripherals Workstations are to have at least 2GB of disk. DDS DAT cartridges are to be available for data acquisition on development systems, backups, and possibly for software transport (Internet is the preferred means of transport). A CD-ROM is needed for SUN OS and software upgrades. Any compression on a transport medium is to be done using a standard commonly available algorithm and archives are to be in tar format IOCs Where Gemini is providing the IOC CPU as part of a contractual agreement, the development systems are to be Motorola MVME-167B (68040@33MHz) with at least 16MB of dynamic memory. The IOC computer cards for development work are defined in the ICS work package description. The target IOC computer cards are not to be established until as late as possible, to take advantage of technology advances while staying compatible with the development systems. A baseline system is included as part of the ICS work package."
1995_gemini_PURE,"All accesses to the control electronics hardware will be through VME IOC's, using the EPICS software. No other control interfaces are permitted."
1995_gemini_PURE,"There are places in the Gemini system where software exists below the IOC level that is interfaced to IOC software. The standards for this interface is not part of this specification. The use of this software is to be explained and discussed on a case-by-case basis. In cases where there is a distributed network of target microprocessors involved at this level, it is appropriate to provide a standard sub-network. This type of Fieldbus is to be implemented using an ALAN/BRADLEY bus, ProiBus, or other approved Fieldbus. In cases where there is a distributed set of commercial equipment to be controlled the recommended method is to use an ALAN/BRADLEY system to control the equipment manually and interface to it using RS-422 or similar connection to an IOC."
1995_gemini_PURE,"All communication hardware must meet the data requirements and software protocols defined in this document. The following recommendations are based on currently available technology. It is entirely appropriate that changes will be made to take advantages of changes to that technology. The control LAN is based on Ethernet IEEE 802.3. The Time distribution systems are described in the Software Design Description. The detector LAN is also based on Ethernet, at least for the development systems. A solution meeting the performance requirements of the system is to be decided later. The backbone LAN cannot be Ethernet because of bandwidth requirements. A FDDI system is recommended for the backbone LAN. Cabling of LANs is shown in Figure 4 - 1. Also shown are cabling requirements to the base facility. Requirements for cabling are given in the Electronic Design specification. Interlock connections must be provided for all critical subsystems. The software interface to the interlock system is defined in the Instrument Control System Infrastructure Work Package Definition. Routers, gateways, etc. are defined in the Electronic Design specification. Their logical placements are shown in Figure 4 - 1, above. Links to the WAN are defined in the Electronic Design specification and shown in Figure 4 - 1, above. There is a requirement of at least one dedicated link of a T1 bandwidth for remote support, development and testing."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Wherever possible, Gemini software is to take advantage of existing software. However, all existing software is to be evaluated in terms of the specifications given here. This helps reduce life-cycle costs and maintenance efforts."
1995_gemini_PURE,Life cycle constraints are discussed in the Gemini Software Management Plan.
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) toolkit is the foundation of the Gemini control system. EPICS was originally developed at the Los Alamos and Argonne National Laboratories for use in large accelerator control and diagnostics systems. It is now an established standard within the international High Energy Physics community and is gaining acceptance amongst astronomical sites. Within the EPICS community there is understood to be an informal distinction between two classes of developers, labeled Internals' and Applications'. Although these Definitions are nowhere written down, this understanding serves as the basis for many discussions with the community and for the nature of training classes."
1995_gemini_PURE,"OPI Operator Interface. This is a UNIX based workstation which can run various EPICS tools. IOC Input Output Controller. This is VME/VXI based chassis containing a Motorola 68xxx processor, various I/O modules, and VME modules that provide access to other I/O buses such as GPIB. LAN Local area network. This is the communication network which allows the IOCs and OPIs to communicate. EPICS provides a software component, Channel Access, which provides network transparent communication between a Channel Access client and an arbitrary number of Channel Access servers."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Database The heart of an IOC is a memory resident database together with various memory resident structures describing the contents of the database. EPICS supports a large and extensible set of record types, e.g. ai (Analog Input), ao (Analog Output), etc. Each record type has a ixed set of ields. Some ields are common to all record types and others are specific to particular record types. Every record has a record name and every ield has a ield name. The define ield of every database record holds the record name, which must be unique across all IOCs attached to the same TCP/IP subnet. A number of data structures are provided so that the database can be accessed efficiently. Most software components, because they access the database via database access routines, do not need to be aware of these structures. Databases Access With the exception of record and device support, all access to the database is via the channel or database access routines. Databases Scanning Database scanning is the mechanism for deciding when to process a record. Four types of scanning are possible: Periodic, Event, I/O Event, and Passive. Periodic: A request can be made to process a record periodically. A number of time intervals are supported. Event: Event scanning is based on the posting of an event by any IOC software component. The actual subroutine call is: post_event(event_num) I/O Event: The I/O event scanning system processes records based on external interrupts. An IOC device driver interrupt routine must be available to accept the external interrupts. Passive: Passive records are processed as a result of linked records being processed or as a result of external changes such as channel access puts. Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers In order to remove record specific knowledge from database access, each record type has an associated record support module. Similarly, in order to remove device specific knowledge from record support, each record type can have a set of device support modules. If the method of accessing hardware is complicated, a device driver can be provided to shield the device support modules. Many record types, in particular all types not associated with hardware, do not have device support or drivers. The IOC software is designed so that the database access layer knows nothing about the record support layer other than how to call it. The record support layer in turn knows nothing about it's device support layer other than how to call it. Similarly the only thing a device support layer knows about it's associated driver is how to call it. This design allows a particular installation and even a particular IOC within an installation to choose the set of record types, device types, and drivers it wishes to use. The remainder of the IOC system software is unaffected. Every record support module must provide a record processing routine. It is this routine that is called by the database scanners. Record processing consists of some combination of a standard set of functions. Databases Monitors The routines described in this section provide a callback mechanism for database value changes. This allows the caller to be notified when database values change without constantly polling the database. A mask can be set to specify value changes, alarm state changes, and/or archive changes. At the present time only channel access uses database monitors. No other software should use the database monitors. Because they are of interest only to channel access, the monitor routines will not be described."
1995_gemini_PURE,Channel access provides network transparent access to IOC databases. It is based on a client-server model. Each IOC provides a channel access server which is willing to establish communication with an arbitrary number of clients. Channel access client services are available on both OPIs and IOCs. A client can communicate with an arbitrary number of servers. It should be noted that channel access does not provide access to database records as records. This is a deliberate design decision. This allows new record types to be addedwithout impacting any software that accesses the database via channel access. A channel access client can communicate with multiple IOCs having differing sets of record types.
1995_gemini_PURE,"EPICS provides a number of OPI based tools. These can be divided into two groups based on whether or not they use channel access. Channel access tools are real time tools, i.e. they are used to monitor and control IOCs. Channel Access Tools MEMD Motif version of combined display manager and display editor. DM Display Manager This tool reads one or more display list iles created by EDD, establishes communication with all necessary IOCs, establishes monitors on process variables, accepts operator control requests, and updates the display to reï¬ect all changes. ALH Alarm Handler This is a general purpose alarm handler driven by an alarm coniguration ile. AR Archive This is a general purpose tool to acquire and save data from IOCs. Sequencer A tool which runs in an IOC or OPI and emulates a inite state machine. Other OPI CA clients It is possible to interface preexisting software systems to the channel access library. This has been done for several commercial packages including IDL/ PvWave, Mathematica, and WINGZ to allow access and manipulation of EPICS process variables by these applications. Othe OPI Tools DCT Databases Configuration Tool This tool is used to create a run time database for an IOC CAPFAST and GDCT Graphical Databases Configuration Tools These tools are used to create a run time database for an IOC EDD Display Editor This tool is used to create a display list ile for the Display Manager. A display list ile contains a list of static, monitor, and control elements. Each monitor and control element has an associated process variable. SNC State Notation Compiler It generates a C program that represents the states for the IOC or OPI Sequencer tool. Build Tools Tools are available to create the various database components from ASCII Definition iles. Source/Release EPICS provides a Source/Release mechanism for managing EPICS."
1995_gemini_PURE,"EPICS consists of a set of core software and a set of optional components. The core software, i.e. the components of EPICS without which EPICS would not function, are: Channel Access - Client and Server software Database Scanners Monitors DCT Build Tools Source/Release"
1995_gemini_PURE,"All other software components are optional. Of course any application developer would be crazy to ignore tools such as MEDM (or EDD/DM). Likewise an application developer would not start from scratch developing record and device support. Most OPI tools do not, however, have to be used. Likewise any given record support module, device support module, or driver could be deleted from a particular IOC and EPICS will still function."
1995_gemini_PURE,Each of the Gemini Controls work packages will be involved with some aspect of EPICS development ranging from creation of new device drivers to database creation and the design of new CA clients.The details of the EPICS work required can be broken down into several broad categories which reï¬ect the nature of the various work packages. This breakdown is given in the following subsections:
1995_gemini_PURE,"Channel Access - Client and Server Software, Scanners, Monitors Gemini will not modify the heart of EPICS. We leave this to Los Alamos. Host-based Development Tools (CAPFAST, EDD, etc.) Neither will Gemini plan on creating new development tools."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers For Gemini this entails support for new devices: PMAC, VMIC5578, BANCOMM"
1995_gemini_PURE,Other OPI CA Clients The OCS may need a CA client that implements the OCS Attribute/Value protocol. The DHS may need a CA client that gathers logging information. This could be an EPICS AR (or AR_cmd) task.
1995_gemini_PURE,"IOC Database IOC SNC programs Files associated with OPI Channel Access Tools These would include MEDM .adl display Definition iles, PvWave/IDL scripts, AR request iles, ALH alarm coniguration iles, and the like."
1995_gemini_PURE,"For the purposes of work performed for the Gemini 8-m Telescopes Project the following Definitions will be used to differentiate between the two ï¬avors of EPICS development work: Internals work would include any of the following: Channel Access - Client and Server Software, Scanners, Monitors Record Support, Device Support, and Device Drivers Host-based Development Tools (CAPFAST, EDD, etc.) Other OPI CA Clients The define two items would be suitable topics for an advanced EPICS course on EPICS System Development. The latter two items would be covered under Advanced Application Development and a case can probably be made that they constitute a category unto themselves which should be labeled something like Internals - Tools' Applications work would then include any of: IOC Database IOC or OPI SNC programs Files associated with OPI Channel Access Tools"
1995_gemini_PURE,"These are all topics that would be covered in an EPICS Basics, Building and Using Applications course."
1995_gemini_PURE,For each class of developer a specific set of skills is required. The following sections list those that would be commonly used.
1995_gemini_PURE,Knowledge of VME and other I/O electronics EPICS Database design techniques SNC programming Use of standard EPICS OPI tools Basic knowledge of UNIX and VxWorks as development environments
1995_gemini_PURE,Advanced C/C++ programming techniques UNIX internals VxWorks internals Real-time programming techniques Motif application development skills Networking skills: TCP/P and UDP/IP sockets
1995_gemini_PURE,"The experience of the High Energy Physics community is that only a core group of Internals developers is required for maintenance and enhancement of EPICS IOC software and of the standard development and CA client tool set. specifically, the IOC core software is almost exclusively in the domain of the Los Alamos AOT-8 ofice. Two major ï¬avors of development tools are in use with support coming from key groups within Los Alamos and Argonne. Many sites contribute custom CA client tools as this generally involves C or C++ programming under a UNIX O/S to interface to the standard CA library. In addition, many sites create their own database record types and new device support and driver layers. Although there is presently a large amount of activity in the enhancement of EPICS Internals software especially in the ields of non-IOC core software, this is an order of magnitude less than the amount of Applications work under way at over 20 distinct programs."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Another large group of predominately Applications developers that are starting work are the Collaborative Access Teams (CATS) at Argonne's Advanced Photon Source (APS).The APS is a facility to produce high brilliance X-rays for a variety of experiments and includes 36 experimental halls with 2 lines each. As of March 1994, there were 15 CATS at the APS with most CATS responsible for a single sector (2 beamlines). Each CAT has its own funding for designing/building/operating the physical beamline, instrumentation, controls, and data acquisition systems. Because the experimental areas must be coordinated with the main facility control system and since 25% of the beamtime must be made available to independent investigators it was strongly recommended that EPICS be used as the toolkit for all CATS development work. Not only would this simplify the integration with the central control system but would also provide a common environment for facility visitors. Typically, each CAT has 1 or 2 developers, and the major focus is not on the IOC software although some new records, like the Multichannel Analyser, have been created, but rather on the OPI CA client applications. Heavy use is being made of both Tcl/TK and IDL to support high-level sequencing and data reduction. This is similar to the Gemini architecture as the bulk of the control system intelligence is contained within OPI CA client tasks. Other items of concern are: Different science programs in use at each CAT which have complex associated data acquisition and reduction routines. The creation of large data sets. Simultaneous local and remote monitoring and intervention. Ease of use for one-time users. Data export to home institutions."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The Standard Instrument Controller work package is tasked with laying the Internals ground work for all other Gemini control system work packages. In this project, the only required IOC-based Internals work is the creation of record, device, and driver support for three VME I/O cards. It is anticipated that all other IOC-related work packages will be performing exclusively Applications work. In the advent of future work packages requiring Internals work it is planned the RGO SIC development staff will be made available. In this way the number of Internals staff is kept at a minimum."
1995_gemini_PURE,"There are several means of transmitting commands and data across the Gemini system: Direct A command source may directly specify the target subsystem. This is the most common means of command transfer from the Observatory Control System to the subsystems. Channel Commands and data may be routed through a channel. This mechanism requires that some (unknown to the source) target subsystem has been attached to the channel as the target. It is possible that the channel is 'intelligent', in the sense that data may be converted from one form to another during transmission. This might be implemented by connecting two channels with a conversion module. An example of a channel connection might be the data stream between the A&G system and the Primary Mirror Control System. The A&G might be transmitting Zernickes to the PMCS, which is receiving Shack- Hartmann data. The intelligent channel would be responsible for the conversion. It is possible that a channel have multiple sources, multiple targets, or both! Finally, a channel might use a separate physical route, to prevent large data transmissions (say) from interfering with the 'normal' command streams. Broadcast Some commands and data signals are simply broadcast across the control system. Any subsystem may examine these communications and respond or ignore as appropriate. For example, the OCS might broadcast a RunTest command, causing all subsystems to perform self-testing. As another example, a critical system failure might cause a ShutDown command to be broadcast."
1995_gemini_PURE,"All commands contain the same general structure: Identification: Command_ID Source Target The Command_ID is an identification that is unique to that specific instance of each command. A portion of the ID is monotonically increasing and functions as a timestamp for journalling and tracing. This is to be implemented using a technique analogous to the CFHT odometer. The Source and Target ields indicate the originator and the recipient for the command, as expected. The Target may be a specific recipient, a Channel, or simply a Broadcast, but the Source is always the origination point of the command. Istruction: Opcode Parameter set The remainder of the command provides the body of the command. The Parameter list structure is dependent on the Opcode."
1995_gemini_PURE,This section presents the generic commands that all Gemini systems must respond to. There are also Control Commands common to all Gemini systems to provide specific functionality during observing. These control commands are presented in the Gemini Software Design Description. specific commands are presented in the Software Design Descriptions for the individual subsystems.
1995_gemini_PURE,"The following commands are status queries used to obtain information about the state of the subsystem. Getversion The subsystem returns its version identification as a string value. Getstatus. The subsystem reports its current status as one of: DOWN the subsystem is not operational BOOTED the subsystem has been booted, but not yet conigured CONFIGURING the system is in the process of coniguring (Steven). CONFIGURED the subsystem is conigured, but not yet initialized INITIALIZING the subsystem is doing initialization actions RUNNING the subsystem is running at observing level MAINTENANCE the subsystem is running at maintenance level SIMULATION the subsystem is running in simulation mode DISABLE the subsystem is functional, but has been commanded to ignore control commands SHUTDOWN the subsystem is in the process of shutting down LOCKED an interlock exists on this subsystem Getstate. The internal state of the subsystem is returned as one of: READY the subsystem is fully operational, but currently idle. BUSY_ON command the subsystem is working, and currently processing the indicated command. NOT_READY the subsystem is not responding to commands at this time. A GetStatus command can be used to determine the current status. GetID The subsystem reports its unique identification tag GetConfiguration Detailed coniguration information is provided. This coniguration information includes details of any settings internal conigurations (ilters, positions, etc.) and, if requested, the detailed results of any self-tests."
1995_gemini_PURE,"The following commands affect the behavior of a subsystem independently of the specific task of that subsystem. SetStatus The target subsystem is to enter the state associated with the specified status argument. For example, SetStatus SIMULATION causes the targeted subsystem(s) to enter simulation mode. Setting the status to SHUTDOWN disables a subsystem. Not all status levels are reachable through SetStatus. SetConfigurations This command directs the downloading of a coniguration from the host to the target subsystem. It is important that care be taken to avoid coniguration values that would result in motion, etc. This command can operate with the GetConiguration command given above to provide 'sequencing points' for subsystem restarts or roll backs. RunTest. The subsystem runs a self-test and reports the result as one of: OK the subsystem has detected no problems, it is running within specifications BAD the subsystem has detected problems that prevent its successful operation WARNING. the subsystem has detected a problem that may prevent it from operating to full specification, but does not prevent it from functioning at this time There may be an argument describing a particular self-test to run. The individual selftests are specific to the subsystem and are given in the appropriate Work Package Description. Detailed results of self-tests are available through the GetConiguration command. SetLogging Logging by the indicated subsystem is set to occur at the specified level."
1995_gemini_PURE,"Communication of information is similar across all systems in the Gemini controls network. Instances of this communication is via routes, which may be direct channels, intelligent channels, or broadcasts. Communication via a route is typically asynchronous, with commands available to establish synchronization as needed. OpenRoute A route of the indicated class is being established for some item. The command includes suficient information on the route to permit the IOC to communicate through the route. The 'route' may be a specific subsystem, channel, or broadcast CloseRoute The route is to be reinitialized. Modules receiving this command are to ï¬ush buffers associated with this route and reset operating parameters to initial conditions. TestRoute A test message is transmitted across the route. All receivers on the route are to respond with an identification. AwaitItem The module sending this command is blocked until information is received via the indicated route, or a timeout occurs. SetCallback A callback is established to process data across the indicated route. ClearCallback A previously established callback is removed."
1995_gemini_PURE,The following commands are common to all IOC-based subsystems. (Most control subsystems are IOC-based.) These commands are processed by the IOC subsystem.
1995_gemini_PURE,"IOC crates in the Gemini system have local databases. Under the Gemini control system, it is expected that the majority of subsystem control is accomplished through these databases. The following commands provide access to those databases. LocateItem If the IOC local database contains the requested item, it responds with an identification suficient for establishing a route to that item. The LocateItem may be broadcast through the IOC network. GetValue The value of the specified item is obtained. PutValue A value is transmitted for the specified item. StartStream A stream of data is transmitted through the indicated route. The IOC system continues to transmit data values until a StopStream command is received. StopStream The indicated data stream is terminated SetEvent An event is established as a monitor of some database entry. Appropriate changes to that entry are to result in the indicated event being transmitted. ClearEvent A previously set event is terminated."
1995_gemini_PURE,Time synchronization is commonly required among control subsystems. These commands are to permit appropriate time synchronizations. Times will be provided in IRIG-B format as UTC. TBD
1995_gemini_PURE,Some subsystems may need to obtain information from other systems within the Gemini control system. This access is accomplished using the same communication and database access commands as given above.
1995_gemini_PURE,"Within the OCS, all commands are represented as ASCII strings. Fields within the command are labelled and nesting is permitted using braces ({ , }). For example, a typical command might be: Ident= {ID=314159 Source=Operator_Console Target=BROADCAST} Instruction=ShutDown"
1995_gemini_PURE,"Details of the implementation are the province of the OCS work package developers, who are responsible for providing procedures for constructing/deconstructing/routing command strings. The mappings of specific IOC commands between ASCII strings and EPICS channel access calls are determined by the individual IOC subsystem developers. Work Package Descriptions include baseline command descriptions that need to be implemented for that specific work package."

2008_peering_PURE,"This document describes the requirements specification (SRS) for the software infrastructure (or product) that enables the internetworking of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) through peering, henceforth termed as âCDN peeringâ, and provides an overall description of it. It presents a means for distinct CDNs to coordinate and cooperate with other CDNs, by investigating and developing (a) models for effective internetworking between CDNs though peering; (b) protocols for service delivery in a cooperative environment of CDNs; (c) some concrete examples (technology trends) that exhibits the notion of content networking; and (d) policies for autonomic management of service level through resource negotiation in an on-demand basis. Thus, this document provides a basis for evaluating the proposal for internetworking between CDNs. This is the version 0.1 of the software requirements specification."
2008_peering_PURE,"When writing this SRS for CDN peering, the following terminologies are used: Web server (WS): The container of content comprising of two layersï£§overlay, which is a collection of Web service host (e.g. Apache, Tomcat), Service Level Agreement (SLA)- allocator, and policy agent, and core, which refers to the underlying hardware infrastructure. Mediator: A policy-driven entity, authoritative for policy negotiation and management. Service registry (SR): Discovers and stores resource and policy information in local domain. Peering Agent (PA): A resource discovery module in the peering CDNs environment. Policy repository (PR): A storage of Web server, mediator and peering policies. PWS: A set of Web server-specific rules for content storage and management. PM: A set of mediator-specific rules for interaction and negotiation. PPeering: A set of rules for creation and growth of the peering arrangement."
2008_peering_PURE,"This document is written for the researchers, software developers, advanced practitioners, documentation writers, and users involved in CDN domain to initiation an open discussion for exploring development opportunities regarding the internetworking between CDNs. Section 2 discusses the steps that are to be undertaken to âbring-upâ or âceaseâ an internetworking arrangement between CDNs. In the next section, system features with their functional requirements are presented to highlight the major services provided by the intended product. Then the external interface requirements highlighting the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users are discussed. Finally, this specification is concluded with the reference documents on which this document is based on."
2008_peering_PURE,"The final product enabling CDN peering assists in coordinated and cooperative content delivery via internetworking among distinct CDNs to allow providers to rapidly âscale-outâ to meet both flash crowds and anticipated increases in demand, and remove the need for a single CDN to provision resources. An ad-hoc or planned peering of CDNs requires fundamental research to be undertaken to address the core problems of measuring and disseminating load information, performing request assignment and redirection, enabling content replication and determining appropriate compensation among participants on a geographically distributed âInternetâ scale. In contrast to a single CDN, for which these issues are deeply interrelated and co-dependent, the main thrust for the final product enabling CDN peering is to consider them in a coordinated and cooperative manner among many peered CDNs, whilst satisfying the complex multi-dimensional constraints placed on each individual provider. Each provider must ensure that their individual SLAs are met when serving content for its own customers to end users, while meeting any obligations it has made when participating in a group of many providers."
2008_peering_PURE,This document builds on the following references: An introduction to CDN technologies [1]. The research problem for internetworking of CDNs [2] The architecture for CDN peering [3]. The performance models to demonstrate the effects of peering and to predict user perceived performance [4]. CDN peering models along with the challenges for implementation [5].
2008_peering_PURE,"CDN peering allows different CDN providers to share resources in order to provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they could not achieve otherwise. It is formed by a set of autonomous CDNs, which cooperate through a mechanism that provides facilities and infrastructure for cooperation in order to virtualize multiple providers. It is expected that an effective peering arrangement between CDNs would require multiple steps to occur. Initiation: A CDNâs reach and scale is limited by its ability to handle peak load, cost of equipment, scalable infrastructure, and/or demand for the increased coverage of its infrastructure. Peering allows a particular CDN to achieve larger scale/reach through resource sharing with other CDN(s). It is triggered by an initialization request sent to the mediator under exceptional circumstances, e.g. flash crowds, when the (primary) CDN realizes that it cannot handle a part of the workload on its Web Servers (WSs). The triggering condition must consider the expected and unexpected load increases in the initiating CDN. Negotiated relationship: The controlling interest of a CDN to interconnect with other CDNs leads to the creation of a negotiated relationship. In the business domain, this relationship (most likely) would take the form of a legal document which describes the expected level of services from the involving parties such as storage requirements, the required rate of transfer, cost of services; the expected duration of receiving service, penalties for service violations, and other preconditions such as the initiating CDNâs preference to gain resources at a particular region. Negotiated relationships can also be established through means nontechnical terms (financial statement) or technical terms (SLAs). Thus, negotiated relationships must specify the interactions among entities including service administration, coordination and disband (or re-arrangement) of internetworked CDNs. In the CDN peering architecture, the mediator instance obtains the resource and access information from the Service Registry (SR), whilst SLAs and other policies from the Policy Repository (PR). The mediator instance on the primary CDNâs behalf generates its service requirements based on the current circumstance and SLA requirements of its customer(s). Therefore, divergent policies are allowed that specify the information that can be shared during interaction through providing a certain level of visibility to preserve privacy. Resource discovery: Once the initiating CDN identifies its roles and activities through the created negotiated relationships for coordination and cooperation between CDNs, the next step is to choose potential CDNs to peer with. The mediator instance passes the service requirements to the local PA to discover external resources from peers. The PA performs the resource discovery process through predicting performance of the peers, working around issues of separate administration and limited information sharing among enlisted CDNs. If there are any preexisting peering arrangements (for a long term scenario) then these will be returned at this point. Otherwise, it carries out short term negotiations with the Peering Agent (PA) identified peering targets. CDN peering protocols: The next step is to configure the âCDN peeringâ protocols at the conduit of the respective CDNs in order to technically support the terms and policies implicitly specified through the negotiated relationships. This step includes advertising the configurations (topology aspects, geographical proximity, capability, performance, etc.) of enlisted CDNs through inter-PA communication. On establishment of a peering arrangement, these protocols also allow participating CDNs to exchange information regarding the content availability and assists to redirect requests to an optimal peer. Request-redirection in a peering arrangement depends on the content distribution and request-routing policies (specified in the CDN peering protocols) associated with the content as well as the specific algorithms and methods used for directing these requests. Operational management: When the primary CDN acquires sufficient resources from the peers to meet its SLA with the customer, the new peering arrangement becomes operational. Hence, necessary functional policies are deployed and administered in an effective way. Once a peering arrangement is established, all participating parties cooperate in the execution of common goal(s). Peering also enables the CDNs to exchange accounting information to perform billing based on the negotiated relationships. If no CDN is interested in such peering, peering arrangement creation through re-negotiation is resumed by tuning the negotiated relationships with reconsidered service requirements. Disband or re-arrangement: An existing peering arrangement may need to either disband or re-arrange itself (within the scope of the negotiated relationships) if any of the following conditions hold: (a) the circumstances under which the arrangement was formed no longer hold; (b) peering is no longer beneficial for the participating CDNs; (c) an existing peering arrangement needs to be expanded further in order to deal with additional load; or (d) participating CDNs are not meeting their agreed upon contributions. Figure 1 presents the interaction flows within the architecture of the CDN peering with an abstraction on its components."
2008_peering_PURE,"The software infrastructure enabling peering between CDNs can be featured with the following major goals: Development and validation of peering and manage the complexity of content delivery across Web servers of multiple CDNs that scale across the globe. Decrease cost of Web access, increase QoS through reduced latency, reduce server load, and bandwidth consumption (by a particular CDN server), thus improving the performance of content delivery. Assists an existing CDN to alleviate congestions by detecting and handling short-term load spikes (i.e. flash crowds) effectively. The operations performed by the product components [3] assist to realize the above goals. Component-wise major functions are noted below. The functions of the Web server(s) and its constituents are as follows, A Web server replicates content on-demand from the origin server and stores it for future use. In the event of Web hotspot, it initiates request to trigger peering. The Web services host ensures the delivery of content to end-users based on the negotiated policies with other CDNs. The policy agent is responsible (in conjunction with the mediator) for determining which resources can be delegated and under what conditions (policies) delegation is permitted. The SLA-allocator performs the provisioning and reservation of Web serverâs resources (e.g. CPU, bandwidth, storage etc.) to satisfy both local and delegated SLAs, and ensures that the terms of the SLAs are enforced. The Web serversâ underlying algorithms perform on-demand caching, content selection, and routing between servers. The Mediator performs the following major functions, It generates service requirements as the basis for negotiated relationships. It passes the service requirements to the PA. It works in conjunction with its local PA to discover external resources and to negotiate with other CDNs. Once a peering arrangement is established, it controls what portion of the Web traffic (i.e. end-user requests) is redirected to the Web servers of the peering CDNs, which content is replicated there, how the replication decision is taken, and which replication policies are being used. It ensures that the participating entities are able to adapt to changing circumstances (agility) and are able to achieve their objectives in a dynamic and uncertain environment (resilience) The main functions of the Service Registry are as follows, It encapsulates the resource and service information for each CDN. It helps in discovering local resources through enabling the Web servers of CDN providers to register and publish their resource, service and policy details. In the face of traffic surges, it supplies any necessary local resource information to the mediator. When a new peering arrangement is established, an instance of the service registry is created that encapsulates all local and delegated external CDN resources. The Policy Repository is used to perform the following functions, It virtualizes all of the policies within a peering arrangement including PWS, PM, and PPeering (i.e. Web server-specific policies, mediator policies, peering policies), along with any delegated policies for resources as a result of the peering arrangement. It provides a set of rules to the mediator to administer, manage, and control access to the resources in a peering arrangement. It returns existing peering policies to the PA during the establishment of long-term peering arrangements. A Peering Agent carries out the following major functions, It acts as a policy-driven resource discovery module for establishing negotiations. It exchanges policy, resource information, and service requirements with external PAs. It is used as a conduit by the mediator to establish negotiations with PAs of other peers and to acquire resources from them. The operations performed by the components of the CDN peering is driven by semi-autonomous logic that ensures content is served reliably through content replication, request-routing and redirection whilst maintaining constant awareness of the health (e.g. load information) of participants. These major architectural features of the CDN peering are briefly described in the following: Content replication is performed using a cooperative pull-based approach where participating CDNs assist each others in serving data. Thus, content replication is featured through extending it to participating servers from the peers in a given peering arrangement, subject to the available resources they contribute Load distribution is performed by measuring the load information and disseminating it within individual CDNs and amongst other CDNs using a hierarchical approach, where current bandwidth and resource usage of web servers in a CDN is reported to the CDN gateway (i.e. mediator, PA and policy repository as a single conceptual entity) in a periodic or thresholdbased manner. The gateways of participating CDNs then communicate aggregated load information describing the load of their constituent servers. Request assignment and redirection is performed at multiple levels â at the DNS, at the gateways to local clusters, and also (redirection) between servers in a cluster. Therefore, endusers can be assigned via DNS (by the peering agents of participating CDNs updating their DNS records regularly) and also via redirection at the CDN gateway when appropriate."
2008_peering_PURE,"The users of the software infrastructure enabling CDN peering can be differentiated by using their membership and contributions to the system. A given peering arrangement consists of explicit and implicit members. Explicit members include the primary CDN, which is the initiator of a peering relationship, and any peering CDNs who cooperate for resource sharing. Implicit members are content providers and end-users. Implicit members are transparent to a peering arrangement but they share the benefit from it. In addition, users can vary based on the purpose, size, scope and duration of peering. For instance, a short-term peering arrangement is to be automated to react within a tight time frameï£§as it is unlikely that a human directed negotiation would occur quickly enough to satisfy the evolved niche. On the other hand, establishment of a long-term peering arrangement calls for a human-directed agent to ensure that any resulting decisions comply with participating CDNsâ strategic goals. Users can also be classified because of the preferential treatment that they may receive due to the policy that pertains to a particular providerâs business logic. Moreover, individual users (or a group of users) can have dynamic QoS requirements depending on the situations that will result in âcustomizedâ content delivery. Thus, users (or class of users) can be differentiated based on userdefined QoS specifications while accessing the service."
2008_peering_PURE,"The product (i.e. prototype system) enabling CDN peering is expected to be deployed it in a realworld test bed such as PlanetLab for global testing, observations, and for performance evaluation. In this regard, existing Web services technologies will be studied in detail to examine the feasibility of leveraging them. A modular implementation stack could be developed on top of the existing standard application layer (e.g. Apache, Tomcat) and protocols (e.g. HTTP, CDI, HTPC). A modular implementation approach would be useful to perform testing on modules at different stages to ensure correct implementation. It is anticipated that a cryptographically secure auction-based framework will be used to assist content replication among peered CDNs to allow incentives for all participants. Load information could be measured and disseminated within individual CDNs and among other CDNs using distributed load indices such as Distributed Hash Table (DHT) or variations of it. Request assignment and redirection could predominantly rely on DNS-level end-user assignment combined with a rudimentary request assignment policy such as weighted round-robin or least-loaded-first, which updates the DNS records to point to the most appropriate replica server of the peers."
2008_peering_PURE,"The challenges in developing the product include virtualization of multiple providers and offloading end-user requests from the primary CDN provider to peers based on cost, performance and load. Due to the proprietary nature of existing CDNs, limited information about response time or service cost is typically available from individual CDNs, and load balancing control is retained by an individual provider within its own Web servers. Therefore, request-redirections must occur over distributed sets of Web servers belonging to multiple CDN providers, without the benefit of the full information available, as in the single provider case. Moreover, an implementation model for the product enabling CDN peering could be based on a complex combination of attributes such as Web server responsiveness or load, expected network delay, or geographic location. Several of these potential attributes vary over time and there is no single repository for listing the value of attributes such as geographic location or expected delay for all Internet-connected systems. It is anticipated that the values used in a CDN peering implementation model are likely to be based on heuristics."
2008_peering_PURE,"Along with the software product, a user manual would be written to help people understand the working methodology and usage of the developed prototype system. It would be written for nontechnical individuals and the level of content or terminology would differ considerably from, for example, a System Administration Guide, which is more detailed and complex. The user manual would follow common user documentation styles capturing purpose and scope of the product along with key system features and operations; step-by-step instructions for using the system including conventions, messaging structures, quick references, tips for errors and malfunctions; pointers to reference documents; and glossary of terms."
2008_peering_PURE,"The product would build on leveraging existing systems. In this regard, necessary inspirations could be obtained by analyzing related systems such as CoDeeN, Coral, Globule, and MotusNet. In particular, the design and implementation approach of MotusNet could be helpful to draw a clear guideline for developing the intended prototype."

2008_keepass_PURE,"This document includes software requirements for KeePass Password Safe, release number 1.10. KeePass Password Safe is an OSI Certified Open Source Software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 2 or under. The system gives resolution to memorizing passwords problem. Its purpose is to keep all of the userâs passwords, data, email accounts, usernames and URLs stored in a very secure, encrypted database, protected by a Master Password. The system is very small so it can be easily transferred from one computer to another. It provides several functionalities on the already encrypted data and the new ones to be inserted. The database produced, is protected by a Master Password only known by its inventor with no backup if lost."
2008_keepass_PURE,Â· When writing this document it was inherited that all requirements have the same priority. Â· First there is presented an overall view about KeePass and then all features and functions are analyzed in detail.
2008_keepass_PURE,"This requirement document contains general information about KeePass, main classes and use cases, functions, features and special technologies. It describes in detail all that KeePass needs to work properly and with safety. The rest of the document is divided into chapters for better understanding. In chapter 2 an overall description of KeePass is provided. First product perspective is presented with product features and main functions. Then follow user classes and characteristics, operating environments that KeePass supports as well as design and implementation constraints. After all that user documentation is presented and will provide you with more details about each featureâs technology. In chapter 3 most important features are presented with detailed description, use cases and requirements. In chapter 4 user and communication interfaces are described. In chapter 5 requirements about safety and performance are presented. This document is intended for Developers: in order to be sure they are developing the right project that fulfills requirements provided in this document. Testers: in order to have an exact list of the features and functions that have to respond according to requirements and provided diagrams. Users: in order to get familiar with the idea of the project and suggest other features that would make it even more functional. Documentation writers: to know what features and in what way they have to explain. What security technologies are required, how the system will response in each userâs action etc. Advanced end users, end users/desktop and system administrators: in order to know exactly what they have to expect from the system, right inputs and outputs and response in error situations."
2008_keepass_PURE,"KeePass Password Safe is a small system that can be easily transferred from computer to computer by a simple USB stick. Its purpose is to solve a problem that really bothers many people today when they have to choose from memorizing a lot of passwords to be secure or to use every time the same one so they wonât forget it but risk be found out by others. So it provides you a very secure, encrypted database where you can keep inside all your passwords, usernames, email accounts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to find them. That is because KeePass Password Safe can lock every database with only one Master Password and/or key file. There are no duplicates, anywhere in your computer, of this Master Password and/or key file so in case of lost database cannot be opened by anyone. Not even by you and that is because there is no recovery password or back door. KeePass Password Safe beside security also provides you with several functionalities in order to keep your database organized and up to date. Those are analyzed in the following pages. More about KeePass you can find out at http://keepass.info/"
2008_keepass_PURE,"More about KeePass can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/ In this website you can find out more about the project and discuss any questions in the forums. You can go back and look at previous releases, code and problems that have been solved. There you can also find information about the developers as well as the projectâs main characteristics such as programming language and algorithms http://keepass.info/ This is projectâs official website where you can find links to all above and also find features available for downloading such as language translations and plug-ins."
2008_keepass_PURE,"KeePass consists of a database which contains data for one or more users. Each userâs data are divided into groups and subgroups so that they are organized in a form that serves right the user. Every user has a unique Master Key which can be simple or composite and its combination opens uniquely the database. If lost there is no recovery. Groups and subgroups contain entries with usernames, passwords URLs etc that can be sent or copied to websites, application and accounts. There is also the ability for a onetime key creation to be used once in a transaction without the risk of reused by others for any reason. In the diagram below there are the main components of the system, subsystem interconnections and external interfaces to help you understand the main idea of KeePass. All of them are analyzed with more details in this document."
2008_keepass_PURE,"KeePass Password Safe provides the user with the following functions: Database â New, Open, Close, Save, Print, Search, Import, Export User can create a new database locked by a Master Key. The database can be opened and closed whenever user wants it. Changes on the data are permitted and the changes can be saved. The user also can print all data in order to keep them with him even when a computer is not available. Also the user can search the database using key words through a search engine provided with the software. Last but not least, the database can be imported and/or exported from/to the Internet. Group/Subgroup â Add, Modify, Delete, Find Data are organized in groups and subgroups in the order that user wants and finds effective. Those groups can be modified whenever. New groups and subgroups can be added easily and can be deleted the same way. The feature of searching can be applied in just one group and not in the whole database if wanted. Entry â Add, View/Edit, Duplicate, Delete A new entry can be added in any group or subgroup and it contains title, username, password, URL and notes. Not all fields are required for an entry. An entry can be duplicated and deleted in the click of a button. Change Language At KeePass website there are available language translations that can be downloaded and applied easily. Auto-Type The user can select a sequence of keypresses that KeePass will be able to perform and send them to any window or browser. Command Line Options The user can pass a file path in the command line in order for KeePass to open this file at startup. Composite Master Key To open a database you must use all key sources such as password, key file and/or Windows account details that were used when the Master Key was created. All these together form the Composite Master Key and are all required in order to open the database. So the user cannot use a combination of them to unlock the database. Configuration This feature is used to explain how KeePass store its configuration and where. Â· Import/Export KeePass can support importing data from CSV files, Code Wallet, Password Safe and Personal Vault. Integration KeePass uses Global Hot Key to restore KeePass main window and Limit to single instance option to run only one instance of KeePass at a time. Password Generator There are available generations based on character sets and based on patterns the first for generating random passwords and the second for creating passwords which require specific patterns. There is also available generating passwords that follow rules which are determined further down on this document. Then there are security-reducing options which reduce the security of the passwords they are applied to. Finally there are configuring settings of automatically generated passwords for new entries so that a random password will automatically be created by KeePass when a new entry is wanted. Secure Edit Controls KeePass offers the ability for passwords and data to be appeared behind asterisks when the user wants it. When this option is turned on, secure edit controls stronger than the ones of Windows are protecting your data and no one can access them, see them or steal them. TAN Support KeePass uses TAN-Transaction Authentication Numbers for even more security. This feature can be used for generating one time passwords so that there wonât be any chance, for anyone to access e.g. your bank account even if he finds out that password. That is because when the password is entered one time it becomes useless. TANs can be added using the TANs wizard. URL Field The URL field supports various special protocols and placeholders and can be used for Standard capabilities where URL field can execute valid URLs for which a protocol handler is defined. In addition to that, KeePass supports all registered protocols that Internet Explorer supports. URL field also offers the ability of executed command lines instead of URLs. Also, placeholders can be used that will be automatically replaced when the URL is executed. Using Stored Passwords Passwords that are stored in the database can be copied to website accounts and applications with security and without retyping them again. This can be done by several methods such us Context-Sensitive Password List, Drag and Drop, Auto-Type and KeeForm. All of them are explained better further down. Lock Workspace Last but not least at all is the locking workspace feature. This feature is turned on and locks the database when minimized. So to unlock it the Master Key is required again. The workspace can be locked manually as well by selecting this option from File menu."
2008_keepass_PURE,"Advanced end users: users that are familiar with programming and can personalize their database by creating auto-types, using command line options and generally can use features and maybe expand their use by adding more functions. End users/Desktop: users with no particular knowledge on computer programming. They just use the database for organizing their data and to keep them safe. System administrators: administrators working on computers that support a lot of accounts and personal data for other users. Using KeePass the administrator can save all data with no risk of leak to third persons. Science/Research Telecommunications: for organizing data that have to do with lots of people and applications Industry: for one-time passwords that can be used for testing controls or for expired entries to gain access in particular systems and programs. Other Audience"
2008_keepass_PURE,"KeePass should run on Operating Systems: WINE, 32-bit MS Windows (95/98), 32-bit MS Windows (NT/2000/XP), All 32-bit MS Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP),Win2K, WinXP, Microsoft Windows Server 2003. The user interfaces used are: NET/Mono, Win32 (MS Windows) All new releases contain Filename Architecture Type KeePass-1.x-Setup.exe i386 .exe (32-bit Windows) KeePass-1.x-Src.zip Platform-Independent Source .zip KeePass-1.x.zip i386 .zip and release notes witch describe what has changed and what has been added. Nothing more than these is required for a fully functional KeePass. KeePass should run perfectly on older releases without any features limitations or data loss."
2008_keepass_PURE,"Timing requirements in KeePass Password Safe: When a password is copied for any reason, (e.g. copy to an application, account, and website) it remains in the memory for only 10 seconds. After 10 seconds pass there is nothing to paste and you have to recopy again. That provides security in a case a password is copied and not pasted anywhere so no one can find it out by pasting later. Language Requirements in KeePass Password Safe: Not in all translations translated help files and tutorials are available. Specific Technologies used in KeePass Password Safe: In order to keep the userâs data fully protected, 2 very secure algorithms are used: Cipher Block Size Key Size Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael) 128 bits 256 bits Twofish 128 bits 256 bits In both algorithms every time the user saves a database, a random 128-bit initialization vector is generated. For the creation of the 256-bit key the Cipher uses, the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-256 is used. All the bytes needed for the Initialization Vector, the master key salt, etc are generated via pseudorandom sources: current tick count, performance counter, system date/time, mouse cursor position, memory status, active window focus handles, window message stack, process heap status, process startup information and several system information structures. When the KeePass is active, all passwords are stored encrypted in process memory so in order for them to be completely safe the ARC4 encryption algorithm is used, using a random 12 bytes long key."
2008_keepass_PURE,"By downloading KeePass Password Safe, the user also gets: A compiled HTML Help file with a tutorial and full help on all features provided A KeePass Internet shortcut which take the user in the systemâs official website where are available downloads, translations, plug-ins and extensions."

2008_keepass_PURE,The user defines the sequences which can be sent to any other open window like browsers or login accounts. By default the sent keystroke sequence is {USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}. There is the ability for the user to define his own auto-type sequence in the notes field of each entry. The sequence must be prefixed with âAuto-Typeâ and length of one line. If a sequence is more than a line it cannot be used and in case of two sequences in one noteâs field only the first one is used. There are 3 methods to invoke auto-type. The first method is to use the context menu command and perform auto-type while the entry is selected. The second method is to select an entry and press Ctrl+V The third method is to use the system-wide auto-type hot key so that KeePass can search all entries in the database for matching sequences.
2008_keepass_PURE,The prefix âAuto-Type:â is required in front of each sequence
2008_keepass_PURE,Sequenceâs length must not be more than a line (59 characters)

2008_keepass_PURE,This feature is a composition of master password and key files and all its composites are required so that the database can be unlocked.
2008_keepass_PURE,"The database can be unlocked with a master password, a key file or both of them. But the same composition of them must be used always. A master key is a password the user creates. Once a master key is created for a database, it is always required. In case the user forgets it, the database can never be opened again by any way. A key file is a file that locks the database. The database opens when this file is present. If the file is lost and there are no copies of it, all data are gone forever and database never unlocks again."
2008_keepass_PURE,"If a master password is required to unlock the database, the database doesnât open unless the password is entered"
2008_keepass_PURE,"If a key file is required to unlock the database, the database doesnât open unless the key file is present"
2008_keepass_PURE,"If there is a composite key, both master password and key file are required"

2008_keepass_PURE,This feature gives the ability to user to import/export files from/to database.
2008_keepass_PURE,"There is the ability to import data from CSV files, code wallet, password safe and password vault. There are available plug-ins which add more import capabilities and formats and those are: File format CSV and File format XML. There isnât any standard password database format and every password manager uses its own file format. Despite that, almost all support exporting to CSV or XML files."
2008_keepass_PURE,REQ-29: File formats are not specialized password database formats
2008_keepass_PURE,REQ-30: File formats only specify a low-level layout of stored data
2008_keepass_PURE,This feature allows switching back from an application to KeePass.
2008_keepass_PURE,The global hot key takes the user back from one window to KeePass. In case of multiple databases running of KeePass the global hot key restores the window which was opened first of all. The global hot key is Ctrl+Alt+K
2008_keepass_PURE,Global hot key cannot be changed
2008_keepass_PURE,This feature generates random passwords.
2008_keepass_PURE,"The password generator creates random passwords every time an entry is created. This password may contain letters (big and small) and numbers. The user can keep it or he can put his own in the field. The generation can be based on character sets, patterns or can be created according by rules. This feature can be disabled if user wants it by selecting 0 as password length in the password generator dialog. More about characters sets and patterns can be found at KeePass Help Files including directions and examples."
2008_keepass_PURE,According to restriction rules that are applied every time.
2008_keepass_PURE,This feature allows creation of Transaction Authentication Numbers.
2008_keepass_PURE,"TANs can be passwords that provide security because they can never be used for more than once time. They can be added to userâs database by using TAN wizard and can contain all letters and numbers. When TAN are created, they appear as typical entries which in the field title contain âTANâ so that KeePass will know itâs a TAN. In TAN entries, user cannot change the title, user name or URL but notes can be added. When a TAN is used, its expiration time is set to that current time and the entry expires automatically."
2008_keepass_PURE,"Title, username or URL cannot be changed in a TAN entry."
2008_keepass_PURE,"When a TAN is used, it expires automatically and can never be used again."
2008_keepass_PURE,"User interface includes various forms and windows. The main database window consists of the main menu bar with file, edit, view, tools and help. Under main menu there is a toolbar with shortcuts to most used functions of KeePass. Those are: new, open, save, add entry, edit/view entry, delete entry, copy username to clipboard, copy password to clipboard, find in database and lock workspace. On the main database window are appeared entries from a selected group. Groups and subgroups can be found at a side bar. When a function is performed like adding, editing or deleting, the active window is the one performing the action. At this time the main database window is inactive and cannot be accessed unless the current active window is closed. KeePass as referred previously uses NET/Mono and Win32 (MS Windows) interfaces."
2008_keepass_PURE,Internet connection and a browser are required in order for several functions to be executed such as downloading plug-ins
2008_keepass_PURE,"When a password is copied, it remains on memory for only 10 seconds. If in the meanwhile it is not pasted anywhere, it must be copied again. That happens so that if user copies a password and not paste it anywhere, the password cannot be found by anyone later."
2008_keepass_PURE,"When a USB which contains the database is removed from a computer while changes havenât been completely saved, the database is damaged and cannot be opened. In this case the repair functionality can help by repairing KeePass database file from tools menu. In case the user forgets or loses the Master Password, the repair functionality wonât help. In case the header of the database, which is the first few bytes, is corrupted, again the repair functionality wonât help. To avoid this kind of situations, backups can be done regularly."
2008_keepass_PURE,"KeePass is a small and light project so it does not need to be installed. All it takes is unpacking from the Zip package. It can be transferred also in a USB stick with no additional configuration needed. KeePass is a project that once uninstalled from a computer, leaves no trace behind. So there is no way passwords and other data in the database to be found later. KeePass is developed under GNU General Public License version 2 or later (copy from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) and can be distributed under those terms.

2013_echo_mrd_WEB,The failure of an individual instrument channel shall not lead to a safe mode of the S/C.
2013_echo_mrd_WEB,"Any hazardous situation, which will not cause immediate loss of but may develop into the loss of the S/C or instrument, shall be prevented by design or protected against."
2013_echo_mrd_WEB,"The design shall allow the identification of on-board failures and their recovery by autonomously switching to a redundant functional path. Where this can be accomplished without risk to spacecraft and instrument safety, such switching shall enable the continuity of the mission timeline and performance."
2013_echo_mrd_WEB,"Where redundancy is employed, the design shall allow operation and verification of the redundant item/function, independent of nominal use."

0000_cctns_PURE,The Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS) report provides the detailed description of the functionalities required for the first version of the CCTNS. The key guiding principle behind the functional design of CCTNS V1.0 is to focus on the critical functionality that provides value to the police personnel at the cutting edge which in turn can improve the outcomes in the areas of Investigation of Crime and Detection of Criminals.
0000_cctns_PURE,"CCTNS V1.0 functionality is designed to focus on delivering value to IOs, records room staff and citizens within the broad crime investigation area. Based on the guiding principles stated above, nine different function blocks have been identified and the detailed functionality of each block was determined."
0000_cctns_PURE,"The functionality of the CCTNS application is focused on providing value to the police personnel, especially the officers operating at the cutting edge and easing the day to day operations of the police function."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Citizens can register their complaints with police and then based on the evidence, facts and following investigation, police shall take the complaint forward. The Registration module acts as an interface between the police and citizens and it eases the approach, interaction and information exchange between police and complainants."
0000_cctns_PURE,"After a complaint is initiated, police initiates the investigation process. The Investigation module of the CCTNS facilitates the investigation process and introduces operational efficiencies by automating most of the tasks that take place after initial entries are made during Registration."
0000_cctns_PURE,Interfacing with the courts during the prosecution of cases is an integral part of the responsibilities of police personnel. A designated constable from each police station constantly interfaces with the courts. The Prosecution module of the CCTNS aids this interfacing by providing a platform to record entries of the court interactions.
0000_cctns_PURE,"The Search module of the CCTNS gives police personnel the ability to execute a basic or advanced search on cases. Using the search functionality, police personnel can search for a particular person, type of crime, modus operandi, property etc. It also gives the user the ability to customize the results view by criminal/accused or by cases. It makes reporting easy for police by enabling them to execute different types of queries such as monthly reporting, RTI related etc."
0000_cctns_PURE,The Citizen Interface module of the CCTNS acts as a conduit for the information exchange between citizens and police units/personnel. Citizens can use it as a tool to get information or acknowledgements from police. The police in turn can use it to respond to citizens with very little turnaround time. It improves overall productivity by helping citizens and police to cut short the drudgery of large amounts of paperwork.
0000_cctns_PURE,"The Navigation module of the CCTNS provides role based landing pages which help in navigating through the CCTNS application. It shows information such as cases assigned, alerts, pending tasks etc hence helping police personnel to plan better and execute with greater efficiency."
0000_cctns_PURE,"The Configuration module of the CCTNS helps keep the application configured according to the states requirements in addition to keeping data elements/rules up to date. With a proper configuration, information such as act and sections, state specific data, castes, tribes, property information etc. can be created updated and deleted. The functional requirements for each of the modules are provided as A1 to A7 in separate enclosures."
0000_cctns_PURE,The non-functional requirements specify the qualitative attributes such as user-friendliness and performance of the system that are critical for the increased user-acceptance of the application.

0000_cctns_PURE,The solution should provide detailed context-sensitive help material for all the possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application.
0000_cctns_PURE,The solution should provide an interface for the user to log any defects or enhancement requests on the application and track thereafter.
0000_cctns_PURE,"The solution should send alerts (e.g., email, SMS) to the user if the user chooses to whenever any action has been taken on the alert."
0000_cctns_PURE,The solution should enable the user to track the submitted defect or enhancement request.
0000_cctns_PURE,"The solution should enable the help-desk user to view the reports on the submitted defects or enhancement requests category-wise, status-wise, and age- wise."
0000_cctns_PURE,The support solution should be accessible to the users both from within the application and also outside the application through a browser interface.
0000_cctns_PURE,"An audit trail is a record of actions taken by either the user or the system triggers. This includes actions taken by users or Administrators, or actions initiated automatically by the system as a result of system parameters. The System must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing and storing information about: All the actions (create/read/update/delete) that are taken upon the critical entities (case, suspect, property,...) in the system The user initiating and or carrying out the action; The date and time of the event. Administrative parameters The word unalterable is to mean that the audit trail data cannot be modified in any way or deleted by any user; it may be subject to re-department and copying to removable media if required, so long as its contents remain unchanged."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them."
0000_cctns_PURE,"The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at least for the life of the case to which it refers."
0000_cctns_PURE,"The System must ensure that audit trail data is available for inspection on request, so that a specific event can be identified and all related data made accessible, and that this can be achieved by authorised external personnel who have little or no familiarity with the system."
0000_cctns_PURE,The System must be able to export audit trails for specified cases (without affecting the audit trail stored by the System). This functionality can be used by external auditors who wish to examine or analyse system activity.
0000_cctns_PURE,"The System must be able to capture and store violations (i.e. A user's attempts to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where violations can validly be attempted) attempted violations, of access control mechanisms."
0000_cctns_PURE,The System must at a minimum be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised: By case; By user; In chronological sequence.
0000_cctns_PURE,The System should be able to provide reports for actions on cases organised by workstation and (where technically appropriate) by network address.
0000_cctns_PURE,"The requirements specify the requirements to control the user access to correspondences, files, and records and various functionalities provided within the system."
0000_cctns_PURE,The System must allow the user to limit access to cases to specified users or user groups.
0000_cctns_PURE,The system should provide for role-based control for the functionality within the system
0000_cctns_PURE,The System must allow a user to be a member of more than one group.
0000_cctns_PURE,The System must allow only admin-users to set up user profiles and allocate users to groups.
0000_cctns_PURE,The System should allow a user to stipulate which other users or groups can access cases.
0000_cctns_PURE,"The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users (such as access rights, security level, privileges, password allocation and management) to be made only by super-user."
0000_cctns_PURE,"If a user requests access to, or searches for, a case which he does not have the right to access, the System must provide one of the following responses (selectable at configuration time): display title and metadata; display the existence of a case but not its title or other metadata; do not display any case information or indicate its existence in any way. These options are presented in order of increasing security. Note that the requirement in the third option (i.e. the most stringent) implies that the System must not include such cases in any count of search results; this level of security is normally appropriate for cases dealing with matters such as national security."
0000_cctns_PURE,"If a user performs a quick or advanced search, the System must never include in the search result list any record which the user does not have the right to access."
0000_cctns_PURE,"If the System allows users to make unauthorised attempts to access cases, it must log these in the audit trail."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Any access to cases, and all other activities involving the cases and related documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal admissibility and to assist in data recovery."
0000_cctns_PURE,"All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them. Ideally, each error message will be accompanied by explanatory text and an indication of the action(s) which the user can take in response to the error."
0000_cctns_PURE,"The System must employ a single set of user interface rules, or a small number of sets to provide a familiar and common look and feel for the application."
0000_cctns_PURE,"The System must be able to display several entities (cases, suspects) simultaneously."
0000_cctns_PURE,"The interfaces must be made customizable or user-configurable to the extent possible. (e.g., the displayed columns in the table, move, resize, modify the appearance). Such configurations must be saved in the user profile."
0000_cctns_PURE,"The System user interface must be suitable for users with special needs; that is, compatible with specialist software that may be used and with appropriate interface guidelines"
0000_cctns_PURE,The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to use and intuitive throughout.
0000_cctns_PURE,"The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable. These defaults should include: user-definable values; values same as previous item; values derived from context, e.g. date, file reference, user identifier;"
0000_cctns_PURE,Frequently-executed System transactions must be designed so that they can be completed with a small number of interactions (e.g. mouse clicks).
0000_cctns_PURE,"Where the System employs a graphical user interface, it must allow users to customise it. Customisation should include, but need not be limited to the following changes: menu contents; layout of screens; use of function keys; on-screen colours, fonts and font sizes;"
0000_cctns_PURE,The user interfaces should be designed to make them user-intuitive.
0000_cctns_PURE,The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241.
0000_cctns_PURE,ICT accessibility: ISO 9241-20 shall be the standard for guidance on ICT accessibility. Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and recommendations. Software accessibility ISO 9241-171 shall be the standard for guidance on software accessibility. User interfaces should meet its requirements and recommendations. Content accessibility WCAG 1.0 shall be the standard used for guidance on content accessibility. The application logo to be available on all pages as a link to the home page.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects, such as graphical images or video, should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next. General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110."
0000_cctns_PURE,Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.
0000_cctns_PURE,Offering alternative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the users task. Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information. They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows."
0000_cctns_PURE,Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard."
0000_cctns_PURE,Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology. This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Acceptable opening / download times: Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g. bandwidth between the application and the user). This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page."
0000_cctns_PURE,Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Providing clear error messages: The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and, if possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Using appropriate formats, units of measurement or currency: When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 9241-171."
0000_cctns_PURE,Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be sufficient so as not to impede readability.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Writing style: The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen should be supported by suitable means, including the use of short sentences, the division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the form of bullet points."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences."
0000_cctns_PURE,Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements.
0000_cctns_PURE,Distinguishable within-page links: Within-page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page. EX. Within-page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines
0000_cctns_PURE,Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Navigation links  particularly links representing the main navigation structure  should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as go or click here except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using appropriate terminology specific to the users tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand."
0000_cctns_PURE,Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or pop-up windows should be clearly marked.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action. Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and presentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation)."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Use of white space: White space on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness)."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Using frames with care: If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page."
0000_cctns_PURE,"Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently."
0000_cctns_PURE,Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.
0000_cctns_PURE,"Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility."
0000_cctns_PURE,Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.
0000_cctns_PURE,Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.

2007_getreal02_PURE,"Users are typical Oregon high school students, grades 9 to12 in ALL high schools across Oregon. Two potential groups of viewers (students) exist: 1) students interested in CS finding more concise information about a CS career, and 2) college bound students not necessarily interested in CS who might be attracted to a CS career with the right âpushâ from information on the Get Real site. A third group of students might be those interested careers as diverse as protein research, weather prediction, neurobotics, medicine, law or other sciences where a CS minor could contribute to a better understanding of data and information. A âConsider a CS minorâ section could provide helpful information. Oregon High school students from several schools and classes were interviewed to gain their feedback on version 1 of the Get Real site. Common themes emerged in the need to change/update overall site graphic design and real people. Students who are not generally interested in CS, suggested graphic design changes, more white space, pictures, and easier to navigate pages. This group was much less tolerant of the site than the CS folks had been. They wanted a site that âspoke to themâ and felt that if you were not a computer science student, it had very little to offer. The suggestion was very strong that the site be broken into more readable chunks of information. The term âwalls of textâ appeared several times. The need for more visually attractive information also was a central theme. They wanted color, photos, diagrams, charts, etc. to break up the text and make the site attractive. Many of them commented positively on the spinning globe and satellite menu. Students who are interested in CS and engineering suggested changes in the Real People, Resources, and Colleges sections. Most of them spent their time in the college comparison chart, and in the real people part of the site. It sounded like they were attracted by the pictures. Several commented positively on the sections in each personâs story. The college comparison chart again scored positive marks. Changes to version 2 should include design changes to all existing pages to shorten up paragraphs and add bullets and charts where possible to accommodate faster page reading and shorter reader attention span. One example used on the engineergirl.org site uses an interactive table menu for more detailed information, leaving the main pages short and to the point. ""Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.

2001_hats_PURE,The user shall be able to view multiple SDTs simultaneously.
2001_hats_PURE,"SDT displays shall also provide the user with a view of text associated with the leaves of the displayed sub-tree. This text shall be copy-and-pasteable in the host operating system. Thus, text displayed in a HATS-GUI window can be pasted into other applications such as text editors that may be running concurrently with the HATS-GUI."
2001_hats_PURE,"SDT displays shall provide the user with the option to refresh the display. When a display is refreshed, the current display is erased, the SDT file is read, and a new SDT display is generated. The new SDT display shall approximate the previous SDT display by expanding the SDT to the same number of nodes, if this is possible."
2001_hats_PURE,"If a displayed graph or a text display is too large to fit inside its window, the windows shall have scroll bars attached to them. Dragging scrollbar buttons shall scroll the display. Pressing the arrow keys of the keyboard shall also scroll the display."

The keyboard cursor is set to this node. If no matches are found, the HATS-GUI shall display a message stating No Match Found."
2001_hats_PURE,"When searching for SDT patterns, search begins at the SDT node corresponding to the node at the current keyboard cursor location. This becomes the original starting location. Search continues top-to-bottom, left-to-right until the end of the SDT is encountered. When the end of the SDT is encountered, search will continue from the root of the SDT until arriving back at the starting location."
2001_hats_PURE,The HATS-GUI shall provide for repeating a search. Repeating a search shall find the next matching sub-tree starting from the current keyboard cursor location. Search terminates when either a matching sub-tree is found or the search arrives at the original starting location.
2001_hats_PURE,"The HATS-GUI shall provide for repeating a search in the reverse direction. Searching in the reverse direction continues right-to-left, bottom-to-top. Search terminates when either a matching sub-tree is found or the search arrives at the original starting location."

2001_hats_PURE,Errors shall not be displayed until requested by the user.
2001_hats_PURE,The user shall be able to clear the error window without restarting the HATS-GUI.
2001_hats_PURE,"When both an SDT and a pretty-printed text display corresponding to a single transformed target file are open, navigation in the pretty-printed text window shall result in navigation in the SDT display. Selecting, and cursor location motion should be mirrored in the two windows. Specifically, when text is selected in the text window, the displayed nodes corresponding nodes in the SDT are highlighted."
2001_hats_PURE,"The HATS-GUI shall display and SDT with 10,000 nodes in five seconds or less."
2001_hats_PURE,"The HATS-GUI shall display 1,000,000 node SDTs in the same amount of time, plus or minus two seconds, as it takes to display a 10,000 node SDT."

2001_hats_PURE,The HATS-GUI shall facilitate parsing transformation language programs and target files. The HATS-GUI shall orchestrate executing transformation language programs. Parsing is accomplished by sending a parser file and an input file to HATS-SML.
2001_hats_PURE,"To execute a transformation language program, the parsed transformation language program and the user- defined library file are sent to HATS-SML. During execution of a transformation language program, HATS- SML writes a sequence of new SDTs. These output SDTs are specified in the transformation language program. The HATS-GUI shall make these data sets available for viewing and/or saving as permanent files in the application. In addition to the output file, the transformation language program may specify that debugging output be written to the standard output stream. Errors encountered during program execution are written to the standard error stream. The HATS-GUI shall capture data written to these streams and make that data available to the user."
2001_hats_PURE,The HATS-GUI shall confirm that the transformation language program exists. (It is an error if the program does not exist.)
2001_hats_PURE,"The HATS-GUI shall check that the parser file is younger than the grammar and lexical specification files and that the parser file was generated from the grammar and lexical specification files. If this is not the case, the HATS-GUI shall generate a new parser file."

1998_themas_PURE,The following subsections of Section 1.0 provide an overview of the entire Software Requirements Specification.
1998_themas_PURE,"This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) specifies the qualification requirements for The Energy Management System (THEMAS). It provides a technical description of all so ftware requirements of the system, provides traceability of software capability requirements to the Statement of Work, and identifies external interfaces. This document is intended for use by the Design Requirements team, Principle Software Architect, and other parties interested in the development and progression of THEMAS."
1998_themas_PURE,"The scope of this document is confined to only the software requirements for the THEMAS system. Only those conditions expressed with the imperative ""shall"" are to be interp reted as binding requirements for this SRS. This document provides a detailed definition of all requirements for the THEMAS system. It does not provide a detailed definition of the exact systems that will interface with THEMAS. The SRS shall give a prototype of a simulated thermostat for verification and validation of THEMAS reliability. The requirements specified in this document are to be used as the basis for software design of the THEMAS system."
1998_themas_PURE,The following section lists acronyms and abbreviations and their meaning as used in this document: ANSI American National Standards Institute C Cooling DB Database DD Data Dictionary DFD Data Flow Diagram H Heating IEEE Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers LO Lower Overtemperature Value LT Lower Trigger Value OD Overtemperature Delta Value SDD Software Design Document SRS Software Requirements Specification T Current Temperature Value TD Trigger Delta Value THEMAS The Energy Management System TSET Current Temperature Setting UT Upper Trigger Value UO Upper Overtemperature Value
1998_themas_PURE,"The following documents shown form a part of this specification. In the event of conflict between the documents referenced and the contents of this SRS, the contents of this document shall overrule all others, with the exception of the Statement of Work. Statement of Work THEMAS_SOW_001 ANSI/IEE Guide to Software ANSI/IEEE STD 830-1984 Requirements Specification Technical society and technical association specifications are generally available for reference from libraries. Copies of other specifications may be obtained from Barry Scott, THEMAS project Manager."
1998_themas_PURE,"This document is prepared in accordance with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) / Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Guide to Software Requirements Specifications, ANSI/IEEE STD 830 -1984. Section 2.0 of this document gives a general description of the THEMAS system. I t provides product perspectives, product functions, user characteristics, general constraints, and assumptions and dependencies of the system. Section 3.0 contains all the details the Design Requirements team needs to create a design. It will contain functional and performance requirements, design constraints, attributes and external interface requirements for the THEMAS system. Appendix A contains the Dataflow Diagrams. Appendix B contains the Traceability Matrix. Appendix C contains the Data Dictionary ."
1998_themas_PURE,"This section of this SRS describes the general factors that effect the THEMAS system and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements, it only makes these requirements easier understood."
1998_themas_PURE,"The THEMAS system is a system that operates independent of any other system, or any components of the heating and cooling system to which it is attached. The THEMAS system, however, is composed mainly of a hardware and software portion. This SRS only specifies the requirements dealing with the software portion of the system. If assumptions or dependencies about the hardware were made, they are stated in this section of the SRS."
1998_themas_PURE,"The THEMAS system is divided into four major sections: Monitor Temperature, Determine Utilization, Initialize System, and System Reports. All four sections have an associated software configuration item; all except the System Reports have an associated hardware configuration item. The hardware requirements are contained in the system specification. The functions of the software for the system are contained in the following paragraphs."
1998_themas_PURE,"The monitor temperature function receives the valid temperature and system parameters. The function then goes through the process of determining temperature status. After this process is done, either temperature limit is exceeded or the temperature change is requested. If the temperature change is requested, then the determine heating/cooling mode process is activated and makes a heating/cooling request. Some other processes that help the monitor temperature function are: validate temperature, change thermostat setting, generate alarm, and system initialization."
1998_themas_PURE,The determine utilization function receives the heating/cooling request and utilization parameters. The function then processes the status of all heating/cooling units and sends out either unit unavailable or heating/cooling unit needed. The fun ction generates either a unit unavailable event which goes into the System Reports function or it generates a heating/cooling signal to turn on/off the units. The Monitor Temperature and Initialize System functions help the determine utilization to do its processes.
1998_themas_PURE,"The initialize system function receives the initialization data for the THEMAS system. The processes that are associated with it are: load heating/cooling unit definitions, turn off all heating/cooling units, load th ermostat definitions, load utilization parameters, set trigger values, set overtemperature values, and establish valid temperature range. The outgoing information that starts the entire THEMAS system is: clear all heating/cooling signals, send thermostat definitions, send utilization parameters, send trigger values, send overtemperature values, and send valid temperature range."
1998_themas_PURE,The system reports function receives event data from the THEMAS system. This function is a database that stores all the events in the THEMAS system. This function is mainly for the use of the supervisor of the THEMAS system to maintain an efficient heating and cooling system. The only process that interacts with the system reports function is the generate event data process.
1998_themas_PURE,This system is intended to be used by people that maintain the heating and cooling systems in a building. The system should not need intervention from outside users other than the supervisor to maintain operation of THEMAS. The system should provide warnings to the supervisor about faulty temperatures. The displaying of the current status of the system to the supervisor should not contain excessive information which could confuse the supervisor. The system should provide information in the form of reports to the supervisor so that the system can be run efficiently.
1998_themas_PURE,"The general constraints of the THEMAS system focus on the functionality provided by the external devices connected to i t. The thermostats shall only provide temperature values and temperature settings. The heating and cooling units provide no feedback to the THEMAS system. When a signal is sent to a heating or cooling unit, no signal shall be available to allow the THEMAS system to determine if the signal sent to the unit was realized by the unit."
1998_themas_PURE,"In developing the requirements for the THEMAS system, several assumptions have been made about the thermostat hardware and the heating/cooling hardware. These assumptions are stated in the following paragraphs."
1998_themas_PURE,The THEMAS system shall be designed to run on the Microsoft Â® Windows NTâ¢ operating system. All the internal process communications shall be designed to operate on this operating system. Any communication with the thermostats and heating and cooling units shall be done through the interface to these units. These interfaces shall run on this operating system as well.
1998_themas_PURE,It is assumed that the thermostat is capable of returning the current temperature and the current desired temperature setting to the THEMAS system. The thermostat is constantly returning these values with no real time delay in between the thermostat and the THEMAS system. The thermostat also has the capability of being set and controlled by a user of the THEMAS system. All data sent by the thermostat is in the correct format for the THEMAS system to use.
1998_themas_PURE,It is assumed that the heating/cooling unit is incapable of returning its current off/on status to the THEMAS system. The heating/cooling unit has no real time delay when sending these statuses to the THEMAS system. The heating/cooling unit shall have the capability of being turned off and on by the supervisor of the THEMAS system.
1998_themas_PURE,"This section is subdivided into ten main subsections: Initialize Operational Parameters, Initialize System, Validate Temperature, Monitor Temperature, Determine Utilization, Generate H/C Signal, Generate Alarm Data, Generate Event Data, Change Thermostat Setting, and Generate Reports. Each subsection describes the software requirement for that individual software component of the THEMAS system."
1998_themas_PURE,The following sections describe the Initialize System component of the THEMAS system.
1998_themas_PURE,The THEMAS system shall control t he heating and cooling units that are defined as part of the THEMAS system.

1998_themas_PURE,Operational Parameters
1998_themas_PURE,"This process shall first determine a known state of all the heating and cooling units by issuing a request to turn off all the units. It shall then read the current temperature values and current temperature settings of each thermostat. If the settings reflect a need for a heating or cooling unit to be turned o n, the process shall issue a request to turn on the appropriate unit. This determination shall be made in accordance with the rules outlined in section 3.1.4.1 and 3.1.4.2."

1998_themas_PURE,Operational Parameters Temperature Data
1998_themas_PURE,"Two types of temperature data shall be recognized from the thermostats: 1) the temperature setting and 2) the current temperature. This module shall process both types of data. A current temperature value that is received from an individual thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range values. If the current temperature value is strictly less than the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the received temperature value is strictly greater than the upper value of the valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system shall identify the current temperature value as an invalid temperature and shall output an invalid temperature status. Otherwise, the THEMAS system shall output a valid temperature status. A temperature setting value that is received from an individual thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range values. If the temperature setting value is strictly less than the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the temperature setting value is strictly greater than the upper value of the valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system shall identify the temperature setting as an invalid temperature and shall output an invalid temperature status. Otherwise, the THEMAS system shall realize the value for that thermostatâs temperature setting."

1998_themas_PURE,The following sections describe the Monitor Temperature component of the THEMAS system.
1998_themas_PURE,The THEMAS system shall determine wh en a reported temperature or a changed temperature setting exceeds the limits set by the overtemperature values. Temperatures that exceed the overtemperature limits shall be reported as such. Temperatures that do not exceed these limits shall be output for subsequent processing.
1998_themas_PURE,Valid Temperatures Trigger Values Overtemp Values
1998_themas_PURE,"The THEMAS system shall compare the reported temperature value to the temperature setting and detect when the temperature value exceeds the specified limits. To clarify these conditions, the following definitions will be used: LO : Lower Overtemperature Value = TSET - OD UO : Upper Overtemperature Value = TSET + OD If T = LO or UO = T then the THEMAS system shall recognize this condition as the temperature limit has been exceeded. In this case this process shall output the condition of the temperature limit having been exceeded. If LO = T = UO, then this process shall output the temperature status."

1998_themas_PURE,"There are two conditions for each individual thermostat that shall be tested for: 1) the thermostatâs settings are satisfied and 2) the thermostatâs temperature indica tes it requires a heating or cooling unit to be turned on. To clarify these conditions, the following definitions will be used: LT : Lower Trigger Value = TSET - TD UT : Upper Trigger Value = TSET + TD Condition 1: LT = T = UT This condition indicates the thermostatâs current temperature setting is satisfied. If this condition is true, then the module shall output a request to turn off both the heating unit and the cooling unit. Condition 2: LO = LT or UT T = UO This condition the need for a heating or cooling unit to be turned on. If this condition is true, then this module shall output a request to turn on the heating unit if LO = T LT or the cooling unit if UT T = UO."

1998_themas_PURE,"The THEMAS system shall maintain the ON/OFF status of each heating and cooling unit. When a request to turn on or off a heating or cooling unit, the following processing will occur. When a request to turn on a heating or cooling unit is received, the system shall determine if the request can be honored. If the maximum number of heating or cooling units is already running, the request will be added to a LIFO queue. If the maximum number of heating or cooling units is not running, this process will generate a request to turn on the requested unit. When a request to turn off a heating or cooling unit is received, this process shall check the queue of waiting heating and cooling requests. If the queue is not empty, this process shall remove one request from the LIFO queue and check the current state of the thermostat for which the queued request was made.

2005_phin_PURE,"This document describes the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) functional requirements for systems implemented to participate in the management of outbreaks and other health events. Outbreak Management (OM) is the PHIN functional area intended to support the needs of investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of a health event or act of bioterrorism. OM should aid in the collection and analysis of data to support identifying and containing the health event. OM systems should be configurable to meet the needs of different types of health events, and capture data related to cases, contacts, investigations, exposures, relationships, clinical and environmental specimens/samples, laboratory results, vaccinations and treatments, travel history, and conveyance information. The application should also allow for new objects to be defined and created during the course of an investigation. Central to the functionality of a system supporting OM is the ability to collect data related to cases and exposures and to create traceable links between all appropriate entities. By tracing the mechanism of transmission and identifying the source of the health event, the appropriate response staff can more effectively contain the event. Systems supporting OM should also be integrated with the systems supporting early event detection, countermeasure administration, laboratory, and surveillance to achieve the primary goal of managing the response to and mitigating the effects of an event. This document provides minimum operational requirements necessary to support an outbreak management system and should in no way preclude a system from incorporating additional functionality beyond what has been covered in this document."
2005_phin_PURE,"The following requirements describe baseline functionality for any system(s) implemented to support Outbreak Management: 2.1 System Architecture: Broad system-level needs, such as flexible configuration, should be addressed by systems supporting OM. 2.2 Data Requirements: Systems supporting OM need a variety of data to support investigations, including data regarding demographics, cases, exposures, investigations, agents, contacts, specimen/sample collection, laboratory tests, travel and conveyance, and restriction monitoring. 2.3 System Functions and Behaviors: Systems supporting OM should support case investigation, maintain detailed and comprehensive linkages, trace contacts, and quarantine and isolation monitoring activities. 2.4 Analysis, Visualization, and Report Generation: Systems supporting OM should enable investigators to produce both aggregated and individual reports about affected entities and events. 2.5 System Integration and Data Exchange: OM information must be exchangeable, based on established standards, between systems involved in the investigation, identification, confirmation, and reporting of a health event. 2.6 Vocabulary Standards: Standard vocabulary lists and data structures have been defined by standards organizations. Where they exist, systems supporting OM should use them. As additional standards are defined, they should be accepted and implemented 2.7 Operations: Personnel, roles, activities, and responsibilities necessary to support all aspects of OM should be clearly defined. 2.8 System Security and Availability: Security of OM data includes the protection of data from corruption and access by unauthorized individuals, as well as the protection of the actual systems supporting OM from sabotage or other failure. A plan must be established for continuing activities when systems supporting OM are unavailable. 2.9 Privacy: Patients, organizations, and personnel must be protected from fraudulent and unauthorized use of their information."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems designed to support OM must offer configuration flexibility so that new data fields, entities, entity types and relationship types may be added to capture information unique to each particular health event."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must support structured data entry for common forms and fields to ensure data integrity, validity, and standardization. A standardized data structure ensures that data mapping of common elements will only be necessary one time, rather than for each event."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM should support multiple deployment options (e.g., client server, disconnected, and potentially web based)."
2005_phin_PURE,Systems supporting OM should provide the ability for computers in disconnected mode to reconnect to a server to share OM data among other computers that operate in disconnected mode.
2005_phin_PURE,OM data should be synchronized so that all instances of OM applications working from the same server are able to share and use the same data.
2005_phin_PURE,Systems supporting OM should be able to electronically record and store data from remote devices that may be uploaded to an aggregating system.
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM should be capable of using configurable, domain-specific vocabulary."
2005_phin_PURE,"The following high-level data requirements are necessary to ensure that the data being collected, analyzed, and reported to support OM are clearly defined."
2005_phin_PURE,"An entity is any being or object involved in a health event. Entities may be classified as a person, organization, location, animal, object, conveyance, event, or other organism. Each type of entity requires specific data to be collected."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture demographic data about persons involved in an OM investigation, including: Subject ID, name, address, date of birth, gender, phone number, race, ethnicity, and country of citizenship."
2005_phin_PURE,"Other descriptive details may be captured, such as occupation and work history."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about organizations (e.g., a local health department, a university, a professional association) involved in an OM investigation, including: organization name, location, and contact information."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about locations involved in an OM investigation, including: name (if applicable), type (e.g., floor, building, room, store), street address, city, state, zip code, country, GPS coordinates, and other specific details (e.g., a specific building on a campus, a business branch location, a local chapterâs meeting hall)"
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any animals involved in an OM investigation, including: type (dog, monkey, etc), age, gender, ownerâs name and address, color, weight, and species. A Subject ID should also be collected for animals in an OM investigation. It may be a challenge to ensure unambiguous identification because demographic details of an animal are not easily identified; therefore, animals involved in investigations may need to be tagged."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data for any object involved in an OM investigation, such as a letter, invoice, food item, or any object that cannot be classified as a âperson, organization, place, or animal.â Collected data may include: name of the object, type, physical descriptors, address, identification number (e.g. serial number, package slip number), and relevant dates and times (e.g., invoice date, shipping date, packaging date)."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any conveyance involved in an OM investigation, including: type of conveyance, route taken (e.g., flight number), etc."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any public or private gathering of people (e.g., church social, ball game) involved in an OM investigation, including: time, location, nature of the event, etc."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture data about any living things other than persons or animals that are involved in an OM investigation, including: type of living thing, and other customizable data collection questions."
2005_phin_PURE,"Systems supporting OM must have the capability to capture an entityâs travel history to support investigations of entities infected, exposed or potentially exposed."
2005_phin_PURE,"When a health event is investigated, it must be assigned an event identifier (i.e., Event ID) that is unique within the jurisdiction."
2005_phin_PURE,"Data describing the health event should be captured, including the reason for the investigation, the category of event (e.g. environmental, infectious), the date the event began, the suspected agent (if known) or investigation focus, the geographic area impacted by the event, as well as the event status (e.g., open, closed)."
2005_phin_PURE,Systems supporting OM should have the ability to record the case definition for a health event.
2005_phin_PURE,Systems supporting OM should have the ability to capture changes to the case definition that occur as the health event evolves.
2005_phin_PURE,"Travel history provides specific information to indicate when, where, and how subjects involved in an event traveled to a location (or to multiple locations), and conveyance data describes the vehicle in which the travel occurred. Examples of travel history include a personâs local travel as a part of their daily activities as well as the shipment of animals or plants from one country to another."
2005_phin_PURE,"Travel history data should include information such as the method of transportation (e.g. bus, plane, boat, car), flight number, departure and arrival dates and times, and the origination and destination locations (city, state, and country)."
2005_phin_PURE,"Information about each leg of a trip, as well as the parent information about the trip, should be captured. For example, if a person who lives in Georgia travels to Seattle and becomes exposed to monkey pox, then visits a friend in Santa Fe, travel history and conveyance data should be noted accordingly for each place the exposed person traveled."
2005_phin_PURE,"Travel history data to be collected for an animal or object should include shipping invoices, animal shelter delivery and adoption receipts, and delivery schedules (including delivery vehicle and driver information)."
2005_phin_PURE,"Detailed conveyance data must be collected when relevant to the investigation, including the carrier identifier, the type of conveyance (such as airplane, bus, or train, among countless others), as well as the make, model, year, and identification number (e.g., VIN) of each vehicle with which the entity was in contact (if this information is relevant to the investigation)."
2005_phin_PURE,"Case and exposure data provide more detailed information beyond demographic data. Cases can be persons or animals, and exposure contacts can be persons, animals, other organisms, or exposure settings, such as travel conveyance, location, organization, object, or event."

2005_microcare_PURE,"System Development: The system will be developed on Oracle 9i platform Front end will be VB (visual basic) Reports will be crystal reports 9 System design: The system will be user friendly with maximum master table structure with all transaction screens to have drop down selection menus to minimize data entry errors. The main data entry screen on claims entry to have drop drown menu from patients profile selection to medicine cost to have drop down. Minimize the use of key board for any number entry to have a faster transaction data entry. The system will be easily trainable for the user with minimum computer skill with simple user step by step manual. Storage efficiency: The structural design of the database will have sequential links with surrogate keys. The database storage will be highly efficient to manage and avoid empty unused spaced blocked, properly defragmenter on a periodic basis. This efficiency will have a maximum provision to expand this program beyond the pilot period, if the program requirements remain same. Security: High intrusion controls will be in place in the system and the database. Access level controls, various organizational level user setting by including granular model setting. External Hardware interface: Bar-code  the system will interface with the bar-code reader to interface all transaction details. E.g. voucher number verifications, claim form entry and selection of voucher usage by the clients. Bio-metrics  the system will interface with the thumb-print reader for verifying claims form used by the clients."
2005_microcare_PURE,"The purpose of this document is to explain the flow and the requirement of Voucher Management System (VMU) required by Marie Stopes International Uganda (MSIU) during the various meetings held between MSIU and Microcare from 28th of Nov 2005 to 30th of Nov 2005. This document is purely based on the Functional Flow Diagram designed by Microcare. The document will explain every small entity of the system including various code generations, Bar-coding and Graphical User Interface etc. This document will help the system development team to understand the overall and detailed functions of every small entity in VMU and to design the system that will meet every requirement of the VMU program. This document will help the testing team to prepare the Test Cases and will help them to test every module in the system and overall testing of the system, so that the testing team will have confidence on the quality of this system."
2005_microcare_PURE,"Past experiences with development aid showed, that financing inputs, e.g. facilities and equipment, does not result in the necessary improvement of health outcomes. Thus as a change of paradigm, the OBA concept finances agreed outputs with predefined quality rather than pre-defined inputs by selling vouchers for STD services at subsidised prices to patients. These vouchers will be refunded to service providers in the private sector (medical doctors, qualified nurses and midwives), government hospitals, NGOs, and faith-based organisations. The major advantages of the OBA approach are, that it allows To target resources to address selected health problems, To target the provision of services to specific parts of the population and To stimulate private market initiative and competition."
2005_microcare_PURE,The approach was successfully applied in the sixties/seventies in South Korea and Taiwan. In recent years also a programme was run in Nicaragua but the OBA has not been implemented in larger scale programs.
2005_microcare_PURE,"Quality health care services for STD treatment, For the sexually active population of the Mbarara district, Through a voucher system, By qualified, approved providers, For a pilot phase of 1 year."
2005_microcare_PURE,"The principles of the voucher, the contents of the health care services, their required quality, the standards to be met by the providers and their infrastructure, as well as the measures for monitoring the quality have been defined in the PDS."
2005_microcare_PURE,"The main structures and processes in the STD voucher programme are: The programme is prepared, implemented and managed by the Voucher Management Unit (VMU). The VMU establishes a network of approved providers (during the pilot phase private, NGO, FBO providers) throughout Mbarara District. The VMU runs a marketing and behavioural change campaign (BCC) to market and inform about the voucher services and how to use them. The VMU establishes and runs a distribution system with the purpose to distribute the STD vouchers to the sexually active population for which the above-mentioned providers are in reach."
2005_microcare_PURE,"Distribution follows certain rules: The vouchers are packed in two with one voucher for the purchaser of the voucher, in the following addressed as client and one for the partner of the client. The voucher may only be bought for personal treatment or for the treatment of the partner. Only one voucher is sold at time. The option of selling more than one voucher to a person at a time introduces too many sources for fraud. Distributors keep a distribution list documenting distributor, voucher number, date, place of sale, and name and place of living of the customer."
2005_microcare_PURE,"The client may honour the voucher at any approved provider of his choice. STD treatment according to the National Treatment Algorithms for STD in Uganda (NTA), adapted for this voucher scheme (TA-OBA, treatment algorithms for STD treatment in the OBA scheme), is given to clients for free for the syndromes of Urethral discharge Abnormal vaginal discharge Genital ulcer Inguinal bubo Ophthalmia neonatorum Acute scrotal swelling Pelvic inflammatory disease"
2005_microcare_PURE,In line with the NTA the voucher includes First consultation with basic lab testing and treatment First follow-up visit for all clients. If symptoms persist drug regimen will be switched If necessary second follow-up visit. If symptoms persist referral to a hospital. Provider documents each voucher case in a standardised patient treatment documentation form.
2005_microcare_PURE,At the end of each month they hand in respectively the claims processing agency (CPA) collects  The voucher for each patient Copyright The standardised patient treatment documentation form for each patient and A summary claims form containing a summary of all treated voucher cases to the VMU for reimbursement. The data from the forms is entered into a computer database. Data checks and plausibilisations are done. Clean claims will be reimbursed via bank transfer. Conspicuous claims will be investigated and cleared by the VMU. The VMU operates a monitoring system including follow-up with patients to monitor proper operation of the voucher scheme.
2005_microcare_PURE,"The voucher management system VMS is designed to atomize the process of Voucher Management Unit (VMU) to minimize the manual process to maximize the quality of the project to understand the progress and timely out come of the project to take necessary steps by the MSIU Admin team to plan for the future and to increase the quality of the STD voucher service. The system will also control the existence of fraud in claims and will help the service provider to reach their payments in time without delay. The other features and details of system will be explained in below sections in the document. The voucher management system is subdivided into following modules to make the system easy for understanding, developing, testing and to implement. Voucher Creation / Preparation Marketing / Sales Claim Entry / Processing Voucher Sales Return Client Feed back Reports (Standard and Customized) Security and User Privileges"
2005_microcare_PURE,"Each of the above modules are again subdivided into subsystems, those details are explained in below sections in the document"
2005_microcare_PURE,"The preparation of SRS is purely based on the following documents Final report on Programme Design Study, Dated 10-Sepetember-2005 Prepared by MSIU Functional Flow of VMUS Prepared by Microcare on 30th November 2005."
2005_microcare_PURE,"This section of the document is going to explain the functionalities of the system, its subsystems and how its integrated and working together. During the system study, it was understood that the first pilot period, twenty thousand vouchers will be sold, but the VMU-system has the provision to upgrade to meet the additional market and projects needs."
2005_microcare_PURE,"The VMU will create the vouchers and sell it to clients through distributors The distributor will submit the sales details back to the VMU. Each voucher should have two portions with three tear off voucher slips each for Client and Partner. The client and/or the partner will choose the service provider and will get treatment First visit is called as Consultation and if the patient is not cured then they can go for first follow up and second follow up, If the patient is not cured then the doctor will refer the patient to some other Hospitals the hospital may be another VSP or any other. Each visit details (including Diagnosis, Lab Test and Drugs) of the patient is called a claim, The VSP will submit the claim to VMIU field office to enter those into the database, The filed office will validate the claim form manually and through system, If any of mandatory information is missed or any false information is existing then the field office will reject the claim back to VSP and the system will keep those claim in a quarantine area The quarantined forms will be sent back to the VSP for verification, if the VSP returns the claim with satisfactory details, the claims will be entered on to the system, in the following months batch. Based on the payment terms agreed by VSP, the field office will generate BiMonth or Monthly financial and medical report and send it to MSIU Admin team to arrange the payments for the VSP. To understand the satisfaction of client the MSIU Admin team will get client feedback from some of the clients and send those documents to field office to enter those into database."
2005_microcare_PURE,As mentioned above the entire system is sub-divided into six modules and again the each module is subdivided into different subsystems.
2005_microcare_PURE,"Voucher creation the voucher numbers are system generated and created with unique identification numbers with security protocols in-built. The created unique numbers are then printed out in the form of bar-codes, which will complement (or stuck on the voucher) the voucher. Then at every level on the voucher cycle this number is captured, on distribution, retail sales, point of treatment, enclosed along with claim forms, at the claims processing and finally for the payment. Such tracking records will be utilized for reports as well. Each voucher should have the following properties, which will have sub-elements to get the batch numbers, voucher numbers, and the project codes. Project code  Group batch code  Batch number  Voucher number  Security code. Project Code (2 Digit) Example: P001 Group Batch (3 Digit) each group batch has a batch of 100 Batches Example: GP0001 Batch number (2 Digit) approximately each batch will have 10 vouchers Voucher number (10 digit) Security Code All codes will be printed out in the form of Bar Additionally the provision for validity date check for the period of vouchers to be used in the program is provided. This validity date can be amended or altered at the system level ONLY by the authorized user Voucher will also have MRP (maximum retail price) Voucher should have three tear off portioned slips with a sub-section tear-off for the partner. If the tear off voucher slips would be sticker then it will not be lost on attaching to the claim forms by the VSP. Each voucher slip should contain the bar code of the Voucher with two identifications one for the client and the other for the partner. The first tear for the first consultation Second one for the first follow-up And the third tear off for the final (second follow-up)."
2005_microcare_PURE,"This system has high security feature as far as the user access to the system, including all the modules, sub-modules and even at the screen level. The voucher will be created ONLY by the authorized person. The will be a provision to create a minimum quantity of vouchers at one time (such minimum numbers will be decided by the management team). Once created vouchers will not be edited or deleted but there will be a provision to with-hold any voucher number if the admin team decides to do for any reason. There will be a provision to amend the validity date of the voucher."
2005_microcare_PURE,The marketing and sales is the next step and the next module in the system. This module will take care of following sub modules.
2005_microcare_PURE,"The system will capture the master details of every distributor so that the users can get the details of any distributor and sales details at any time. Each distributor will have unique code and detailed descriptions such as name, address, locations and type of business etc. such valid information will help us track information related to sales and distributions. Following fields will be captured at this master. Distributor Code (3 Digit) Example: DS0001* Name of the distributor* Type of business (e.g. hospital/pharmacy/NGO)* Proprietor Name* Designation Address (Street/Road, Sub District, County, Sub County and Village or Town)* Contact No Email Id Status (active/deactivate)"
2005_microcare_PURE,"The address field will capture the geographical location of the distributor, such as District, Sub-District, County, Sub-County or Village / Town, road or street. All the level of details will have a master table in order to update as per the program requirements. The system will check the duplicated ID for the distributors. The system can allow the duplicate names of the Distributor. On capture of any duplicate name the system will give a warning message to have the duplicate name or to change the name. For better reporting purposes it is better to have a differentiating indicator on the name. System will have a provision to print the distributor master details. The distributor screen will have a provision to view the Sales History of a particular distributor with following summary details. Distributor Name as Report Header and following as the report footer Batch No Date of purchase Qty Purchase Qty Sold Qty Returned Balance Qty (any other details required by the MSIU office)"
2005_microcare_PURE,There will be a provision to select a particular distributor to view the details (e.g. sales) by double clicking on the grid. Print option of above report is based on User Login Permission only. There will be an option for doing the following at every screen. New (adding new records) Edit (updating available records) Delete (deleting will be allowed only if no child records are created) Active/Deactivate (if the distributor has to be deactivated or terminated)
2005_microcare_PURE,There will also be a provision for the other users to view the details of a distributor with purchase and sales details.
2005_microcare_PURE,The system will capture the details of MSIU Salesman; this would help the MSIU management team to understand the performance of each Team or salesman. During every distribution transaction the user should select the name of the sales man listed from Team Master. The Salesman master should capture following informations. Salesman Code* Name of the Salesman* DOB & Age* Gender* Communication Address* Contact No E-Mail Id Sales-team (which will have a separate master)*.
2005_microcare_PURE,"The sales team master is for the future development of this program, if this program is extended to a country-wide network, this master will help understand and tack sales information."
2005_microcare_PURE,The system will check the duplicated ID for the salesman and team. The system can allow the duplicate names of the salesman.

2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"The EIRENE System Requirements Specification defines a radio system satisfying the mobile communications requirements of the European railways [EIRENE FRS]. It encompasses ground-train voice and data communications, together with the groundbased mobile communications needs of trackside workers, station and depot staff and railway administrative and managerial personnel. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"Figure 1-1 shows how the EIRENE system is covered in this specification, by associating each element of the system with its corresponding section number(s). References specifying the main interfaces are also cited, and are detailed more extensively in Appendix A. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,The application of this specification will ensure interoperability for trains and staff crossing national or other borders between systems. It also intends to provide manufacturing economies of scale wherever practical. (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,The EIRENE System Requirements Specification defines the set of requirements which a railway radio system shall comply with in order to ensure interoperability between national railways. (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,The EIRENE Functional Requirements Specification [EIRENE FRS] specifies the functional requirements for EIRENE. (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"The specification distinguishes between requirements affecting a railwayâs network infrastructure, onto which mobiles will roam, and the requirements concerning mobiles which may be used in any EIRENE compliant network. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"The statements made in the specification are assigned to one of three categories: (I) Mandatory (indicated by â(M)â at the end of the paragraph). It is mandatory that each railway meets these specifications where interoperability on lines, or equipment interoperability, is required. Optional (indicated by â(O)â at the end of the paragraph). Whilst not being mandatory for interoperability, when the option is selected, the method defined in the SRS and FRS by which such features are implemented becomes mandatory, both to provide a consistent service and to present a recognised and agreed standard to manufacturers in order to obtain economies of scale in development and manufacture. Information (indicated by â(I)â at the end of the paragraph). These are statements intended to provide explanatory notes."
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"The system is based on the ETSI GSM standard. To meet additional functionality and performance requirements, this standard is to be supplemented by: (I) the following GSM services: voice broadcast service; voice group call service; enhanced multi-level precedence and pre-emption; General Packet Radio Service (GPRS); railway specific applications: exchange of number and location information between train and ground to support functional and location dependent addressing; emergency calls; shunting mode; multiple driver communications; direct mode facility for set-to-set operation; railway specific features, network parameters and standards: link assurance signal; calling and connected line presentation of functional identities; cab radio, man-machine and other interfaces; environmental specifications; controller position functional specifications; system configuration (numbering plans, priority levels, subscriber details, closed user groups, etc)."

2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"Later releases of these specifications may be used, providing that the system is backwards-compatible with the versions listed. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,The system is based on the GSM architecture which is summarised in figure 1-3. (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"The system comprises the following elements: (I) Base station sub-systems (BSSs) of base station controllers (BSCs) controlling base transceiver stations (BTSs) each containing a number of transceivers (TRXs). Network sub-systems (NSSs) interfacing to the BSS via the GSM âAâ interface. The NSS contains mobile services switching centres (MSCs) with primary responsibility for call control. The MSC is supported by a visitor location register (VLR) containing temporary details of subscribers active within the MSC area, a group call register (GCR) containing attributes of voice group and broadcast call configurations for the related MSC area and home location registers (HLRs) holding subscriber details on a permanent basis. The network also comprises General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) infrastructure elements supporting the respective packet radio services. The serving GPRS support node (SGSN) is a location register function storing subscription information and location information for each subscriber registered in that node. It interfaces to the BSS via the Gb interface and to the MSC/VLR via the Gs interface and to the HLR via the Gr interface. The gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) is a location register function storing subscription information and routeing information (needed to tunnel packet data traffic destined for a GPRS MS to the SGSN where the MS is registered) for each subscriber for which the GGSN has at least one PDP context active. It interfaces to the SGSN via the Gn interface, to the HLR via the Gx interface, to external packet data networks via the Gi interface and to other GSM/GPRS networks via the Gp interface. Mobile equipment (ME) interfacing to the BSS via the air (Um) interface. Subscriber Identity Modules (SIMs) containing information specific to single subscribers. A standardised interface links mobile equipment to SIM cards. A SIM and ME combined are termed a mobile station (MS). Operation and Maintenance Centre (OMC) for managing the network. Billing Centre."
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"Signalling within the NSS and between NSSs is carried out according to signalling system number 7, SS7, making specific use of the mobile application part (MAP) of that standard. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,Railway networks may implement a short message service centre to be interfaced to the GSM network in order to support railway specific messaging applications. (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,A railway GSM network is also likely to have external interfaces to: (I) private railway fixed networks; public operator networks; controller equipment; specialised railway systems (eg train control systems).
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,EIRENE will provide the radio bearer for ERTMS/ETCS. The EURORADIO layers are responsible for ensuring the overall safety of the transmission link between train-borne and trackside ERTMS/ETCS applications. (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"In addition to a GSM capability, a direct mode capability may be provided for railway mobiles for set-to-set operation. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,Standardised interface protocols are to be provided to allow applications external to EIRENE to access EIRENE bearer services. (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,Applications may include: (I) public address; intercom; driver safety device; train borne recorder.
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"To meet the specific railway requirements, a number of additional features are required some of which have been incorporated in the GSM Standard. The main aspects are summarised in the following paragraphs. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,Equipment is to be capable of operation in the following frequency bands: (I) Band Railway GSM (R-GSM) Frequencies (MHz) 876-915/921-960
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,Note: the R-GSM band includes the Public GSM (P-GSM) and Extended GSM (E-GSM) bands.
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"All mobiles are to support these services as defined in the relevant GSM specifications. The services will mainly be used to: (I) broadcast messages from controllers to certain groups of trains in a controller area; broadcast messages from trains or shunting team members to controllers or other mobiles in a defined area; conduct group calls between train drivers and controllers over pre-defined areas; conduct group calls between trackside workers, shunting team members, station staff and similar groups, typically over local areas."
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"This GSM specification is to be implemented in order to achieve the high performance requirements necessary for emergency group calls. It is also necessary to meet different grades of service requirements for different types of communications traffic on the system (eg safety (eg train control system), operational and administrative communications). (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"Many railway staff need to be addressed by functional rather than personal numbers. The functional numbers may change on a regular basis. The principal example is that of train drivers, who need to be addressed by train numbers which change with each journey. To overcome this difficulty a translation facility will be provided to allow calls to functional numbers to be forwarded to the most appropriate personal number at that time. Thus calls made to a train number are forwarded by the network to the appropriate driver or locomotive for that train at that time. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,A follow-me service will be implemented in the EIRENE network using the GSM Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) facility to allow users to establish and terminate the forwarding of calls from a functional number to their personal number. (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"Train drivers need to be able to contact controllers and other staff at the push of a single button. As the train moves through different areas, controllers are liable to change. As a consequence it is necessary to provide a means of addressing calls from a train to certain functions based on the location of the train. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"The only source of location information available within the GSM network is the cell that the train is in. However, there are a number of external sources from which more accurate location information may be derived: (I) on-train location systems; trackside balises; information from ground based systems."
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"Within EIRENE, the primary means of determining the location of a train for the purpose of location dependent addressing will be based on the cell dependent routing. This may be supplemented with additional information from external systems to provide a greater degree of accuracy. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,Railway mobiles may support a direct communications mode whereby a mobile can communicate with all other railway mobiles in a local area without the use of GSM infrastructure. Such a mode is required for use where: (I) no GSM infrastructure is provided; GSM infrastructure equipment has failed.

Sections 5, 6, and 7 detail the additional requirements for Cab radio, General purpose radio, and Operational radio equipment respectively. Note that for the handheld version of the General purpose radio, commercial standards apply. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"Section 8 covers controller equipment. Section 9 is concerned with a numbering plan for the variety of functional numbers which are required. Section 10 details the handling of other information, such as priority, closed user groups and encryption algorithms, which must be applied consistently in all networks. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,Section 11 specifies functional and location dependent addressing. Section 12 refers to the possible use of pre-defined text messages (not required for interoperability). (I)
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"Sections 13 to 15 describe the implementation of emergency calls, shunting mode and direct mode. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,References for all sections are included in appendix A. (I)

2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"The call waiting service (CW) permits a party A to be notified of an incoming call from party C whilst the traffic channel is not available for the incoming call and party A is engaged in an active call with party B. However call waiting does not operate during the prior set up of the call between the parties A and B (including alerting if used). Therefore the alerting duration has to be as short as possible in order to minimize the risk for the party A of missing notification of an incoming call from party C with a higher eMLPP priority. Taking into account technical and operational aspects, it is recommended to set the relevant timer(s) in the network in such a way that the maximum alerting duration is limited to 60s. (I)"

2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"For network planning, the coverage level is defined as the field strength at the antenna on the roof of a train (nominally a height of 4m above the track). An isotropic antenna with a gain of 0dBi is assumed. This criterion will be met with a certain probability in the coverage area. (The target coverage power level is dependent on the statistical fluctuations caused by the actual propagation conditions.) (I)"

2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"There is a quality of service requirement for handover executions (eg a break of 10s would clearly be unacceptable to the user). 300ms represents our current best estimate of the QoS figure, although this will need to be confirmed through user trials. (I)"
2006_eirenesys15_PURE,"An additional option is available to reduce the handover break period, namely the use of the synchronous handover capability to reduce the break period to about 150ms.

1999_dii_PURE,"Automatically: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent on information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information / parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved. Business Rule: A narrative description of policies, procedures, or principles within an organization. Business rules can be divided in to four categories: definitions, facts, constraints, and derivations. Definitions are business rules that define entities and attributes. Facts are either links (relationships) between entities or associations between an entity and attributes Constraints are conditions about the data that must always be true. They are the integrity rules that protect the data in the eventual database. Derivations are business rules that materialize a new piece of information (often attribute values) from other pieces of information. For example, a mathematical derivation might specify that you can obtain a person's age by subtracting his or her birth date from the current date. Commit/Rollback: An individual transaction is processed (commit) or discarded (rollback) by the proponent maintainer of the data items involved. Discretionary Access Controls (DAC): A means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects or groups to which they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission on to any other subject. Dynamically Generated Processing: Indicates processing initiated during execution of other processes, but dependent upon information and/or parameters to be generated or supplied to these other processes. The information/parameters may be data dependent, or application dependent, or dependent on a manual process/human intervention. It will include controls qualifying the processing involved. Location Transparency: occurs when the physical location of data is transparent to the applications and users of the database system. For example, a view that joins table data from several databases provides location transparency because the user of the view does not need to know where the data originates from. Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Imediates access to an object based on the clearance level of the subject (user) and the sensitivity label of the object. (These controls are always enforced above any discretionary control implemented by users). Mirrored Databases: Replication and maintenance of a database on a transaction basis for the purpose of rapid error or failure recovery as supported by the resident COTS RDBMS own system utilities and operating system. Object: A passive entity that contains or receives information. Access to an object potentially implies access to the information it contains. Examples of objects are records, blocks, pages, segments, files, directories, directory trees, and programs, as well as bits, bytes, words, fields, processors, video displays, keyboards, clocks, printers, and network nodes. Proponent Scheme: Describes the sites at which databases are replicated and also who owns and has update authority with respect to the data at each site. It refers to proponency at the source and record level. Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID): A RAID system appears as one very large, reliable disk to the CPU. The main reason for using RAID storage is its reliability. RAID has the same advantages as shadowing and striping at a lower cost. There are several types/levels of RAID implementations, including: RAID 0 (known as disk striping), RAID 1 (known as disk shadowing), RAID 3 (in which data is distributed in small increments across all data disks and adds a parity value to a separate disk for recovery if any disk fails, RAID 4 (in which data is distributed in large chunks across all data disks and also has a single parity disk. RAID 4 intended to overcome performance penalties of RAID 3 for small transfers. RAID 5 (in which parity over RAID 3 or RAID 4 implementations), and RAID 6 ( in which two parity disks in addition to data disks are used in an attempt to further improve performance). In a RAID 5 implementation, the data is stored as are check sums and other information about the contents of each disk in the array. If one disk is lost, the others can use the check sums and other stored information to recreate the lost data. Storage system vendors may provide additional enhancements to RAID level implementations to improve performance and reliability. Remote Data Access (RDA): is an ISO (9579) application layer interoperability standard (protocol and formats) to support access by an application to a (remote) DBMSs over an OSI network. The goal of RDA is to allow interoperability between applications (clients) and databases (servers) of different manufacturers so that an application is able to read and update data in remote databases via well defined standards. RDA defines a set of client and server standards and a mapping of SQL commands to these services. RDA also defines an interface to ISO (transaction processing) two phase commit TP services in the case where updates to multiple remote databases need to be coordinated. RDA does not yet define interoperability between server databases (i.e. it is not yet a standard for distributed database management). Replication Scheme: Information that precisely identifies DBs, or partitions of DBs, to be copied and/or distributed, replication schedules, and master/remote sites that are to receive the copies. Spatial DBMS: Geographic information system that organizes and maintains spatial data (i.e. data with graphical attributes) in terms of type, scale, location(s), extent, topology and geometry. Supports queries of spatial data where the selection criteria are defined by spatial attributes. SRI: A Standing Request For Information (SRI) is a capability in which CASS monitors for the occurrence of conditions established by an application program, and notifies the calling or establishing application program when the conditions are satisfied. An SRI may be one of three types: timer-based, data-based, or message-based. Subject: An active entity, generally in the form of a person, process, or device that causes information to flow among objects or changes the system state. Technically, a process/domain pair. Transaction Journalling: Individual messages or database transactions are stored in a journal file, which may be a linear log file or a circular file."
1999_dii_PURE,"The metadata and procedures are described for the current Information Resource Submittal Package . Metadata and Related Information An XML tag may be described as any object and is easily created by anyone using a text editor. Although XML is a relatively new technology, many developers are already using XML in operational COE systems and have already created tags and specifications, many of which may be inconsistent with tags used in other systems. So far, the burgeoning sets of XML tags have created redundancy and irrelevancy, and they lack validity. XML Registry. To ensure interoperability, this registry provides a baseline set of tags developed through coordination and approval among the Community. The Registry allows a user to browse, search, and retrieve data that satisfy your requirements. The Registry has a substring search capability so that the user may easily find information resources that meet the criteria. The user may specify whether to search for the term within the name of the information resource or the definition or both. Developer's Role. Developers are urged to review the baseline tags, adopt them where possible, and subscribe to future notifications about the tags. If, after reviewing the tags in the Registry, you cannot reuse an existing specification (a.k.a. Document Type Definition (DTD)) or existing tags, you may submit your proposed tag to a Community of Interest (COI) and provide amplifying information for all to understand the semantics for its proper use. COE Chief Engineer's Role. The COE Chief Engineer will approve a single Point of Contact (POC) for a COI to manage the tags within that COI. The COE Chief Engineer will reserve ultimate authority to mediate any unresolved disputes within all COIs. The COE Data Engineering Team's Role. Tags and semantics will be analyzed to identify opportunities to consolidate tags towards a single or a minimal number of representations. A ""market forces"" model can also guide COE Data Engineering in identifying the weak candidates from the strong.8 The Community of Interest's POC's Role. (The information in the following section is current as of 17 May, 1999. Please consult the Registry for the most authoritative list of information resources types.) The POC responsibilities will include the transitioning of information resources from one status to another. Table 1 lists the valid types of information resources. The status levels are developmental, candidate, approved, rejected, and retired."

1999_dii_PURE,"If the term is well recognized outside its container term, designate it as an element. Example: CTRY_CD, CTRY_NM, CTRY_ABBRD_NM, CTRY_OFF_NM, CTRY_SCP_NT_TX, and CTRY_PSTL_NM are all characteristics (ER-attributes) for the entity CTRY. In the relational world, they are columns within the table ctry, attributes of the entity ctry in er-modeling, and member attributes in object modeling. It would be expected that a submitter would identify them as attributes rather than elements. But if they were identified as attributes of the element ctry, then the additional baggage (other attributes) must be carried, or submitted as separate elements. We wish to limit the proliferation of tags, so we strongly urge folks to use XML_Attributes sparingly."
1999_dii_PURE,"Initially, the Registry will not have keyword, thesaurus, or ontology support but it will have a substring search for a number of fields, including definition. Therefore, we urge submitters to include enough expressive terms so that COE developers would easily find the term they might consider ""natural"" in the definition and find the desirable tag for expressing that concept. Example: If the registered tag is ORG_ID, the description that includes references"
