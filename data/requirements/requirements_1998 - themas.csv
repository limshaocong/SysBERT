A current temperature value that is received from an individual thermostat shall be compared to the valid temperature range values. If the current temperature value is strictly less than the lower value of the valid temperature range or if the received temperature value is strictly greater than the upper value of the valid temperature range, then the THEMAS system shall identify the current temperature value as an invalid temperature and shall output an invalid temperature status. Otherwise, the THEMAS system shall output a valid temperature status.

To clarify these conditions, the following definitions will be used: LT : Lower Trigger Value = TSET - TD UT : Upper Trigger Value = TSET + TD Condition 1: LT = T = UT This condition indicates the thermostat’s current temperature setting is satisfied. If this condition is true, then the module shall output a request to turn off both the heating unit and the cooling unit.

If the maximum number of heating or cooling units is already running, the request will be added to a LIFO queue. If the maximum number of heating or cooling units is not running, this process will generate a request to turn on the requested unit. When a request to turn off a heating or cooling unit is received, this process shall check the queue of waiting heating and cooling requests.
