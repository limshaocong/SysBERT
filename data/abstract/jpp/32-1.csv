2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35761,"In the present study, an analytical model based on convective heat feedback is developed for the estimation of the solid fuel surface regression rate of hybrid rocket engines with head-end swirling-flow oxidizer injection. The convective heat transfer between the axial core flow and the burning fuel surface, coupled with the convective heat feedback between the effective tangential flow and the burning fuel surface, is the means by which the fuel regression rate is presumed to be increased by swirl, above that due to the axial mass flux. The representation of the effective boundary layers used in this study includes the influence of transpiration, effective hydraulic diameters (for flows in the axial and tangential direction), and fuel surface roughness. From the literature, a variety of propellant combinations, engine sizes, and flow swirl numbers are evaluated for engines having circular-port fuel grains, with sample model results provided. The predicted fuel regression rates for the most part compare quite well with the corresponding experimental data.",32,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35591,"An experimental study is conducted to evaluate amine–borane materials in solid fuels that create hypergolic combustion with nitric acid. Ignition delays as short as 3.3 ms have been measured for fuels containing amine–boranes in an epoxy binder: one of the fastest ignition delays ever recorded for a hypergolic hybrid fuel. The heats of formation of the amine–boranes were measured and theoretical (ideal) performance calculated. Some amine–boranes exhibit a double peak performance allowing for a range of oxidizer/fuel combinations resulting in high performance. Amine–borane/fuel binder combinations can produce a 3.8 and 8.2% increase in and , respectively, over monomethylhydrazine and a increase in and a 17% decrease to 5% increase in over other hypergolic hybrid rockets that use similar oxidizers. Amine–boranes also exhibit trends of being less toxic and more air stable than their base amines. In addition to the hypergolic properties, performance alone motivates the use of these materials, and it was found that amine–boranes could improve by and by compared with conventional rocket fuels, excluding liquid .",32,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35781,"Aluminum–magnesium alloy powders with magnesium contents ranging from 5% to 50 wt % were prepared by close-coupled gas atomization in order to study the influence of the magnesium-rich phase on oxidation of alloy powders. The phase composition, morphology, and oxidation process of the alloy powders were studied by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope/energy-dispersive x-ray, and thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis, respectively. The results showed that the complete oxidation temperature decreased with the increase of magnesium content, and the selective oxidation of the magnesium-rich phase occurred in the oxidation processes of the alloy powders. Furthermore, different exothermic peaks corresponded to oxidation of different phases. For alloy powders with low magnesium content, the exothermic peaks occurred above 1000°C, corresponding to the oxidation of residual aluminum; whereas for alloy powders with high magnesium content, the exothermic peaks occurring at about 570°C were associated with the oxidation of and the exothermic peaks occurring at about 750°C were concerned with the oxidation of the nanoflake aluminum-rich phase. The magnesium-rich phase and nanoflake aluminum-rich phase were responsible for the excellent thermal performance of the gas-atomized aluminum–magnesium alloy powders.",32,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35694,"The heat transfer of a hydrocarbon fuel was investigated experimentally under steady states and pressure-transient states with respect to engineering applications for the scramjet regenerative cooling system. The experiments were carried out in a uniformly heated horizontal minitube with an inner diameter of 1.0 mm. The main objective of this study was to compare the heat transfer coefficients under steady states with those under pressure-transient states as well as to investigate the effect of the pressure-transient rate on heat transfer. The results show that the steady-state heat transfer coefficients are higher than the transient-state heat transfer coefficients, especially in the vicinity of the critical point. Accordingly, the thermal margin for a regenerative cooling system could be further increased by approximately 25% to ensure the reliability of the safety analysis under abnormal pressure-transient conditions.",32,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35827,"Large-eddy simulations are carried out for the coaxial injection of liquid nitrogen and preheated hydrogen at supercritical pressures. The conditions are similar to that in typical liquid-propellant rocket combustors. By using nitrogen as a model gas, the mixing process is studied without the interference with chemical reactions. An analysis of the thermodynamic conditions that arise in the shear layer reveals that local phase separation may occur if the injection condition is transcritical. A novel volume-translation method on the basis of the cubic Peng–Robinson equation of state is introduced for the use in multispecies large-eddy simulations and is tested for both trans- and supercritical injection conditions. The new thermodynamic model corrects the deficiencies of the Peng–Robinson equation of state in the transcritical regime at minimal extra computational cost. Two independently developed large-eddy simulation codes are used for the simulations and the results are compared. The outcome indicates that the flowfield is mainly controlled by the turbulence on the resolved scales, and an accurate model for the fluid’s thermodynamic state is more important than the subgrid-scale turbulence model or the details of the code architecture. A comparison with available experimental data shows that important flow features are well predicted.",32,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35563,"To study the thermal behavior inside scramjet cooling channels at different aspect ratios, a three-dimensional model of fuel flow in terms of the fuel real properties is built and validated through experiments. The whole cooling channel is divided into noncracking and cracking zones, and only the noncracking zone is studied in this paper. The simulation results indicate that heat transfer deterioration occurs very easily in scramjet engine cooling channels due to its small fuel mass flux, relatively high wall heat flux, and near-critical operating pressure. Increasing the channel aspect ratio is not always beneficial for reducing the wall temperature because of thermal stratification, and there exists an optimum value below 8 to make the wall temperature lowest. In addition, increasing the channel aspect ratio will reduce the thermal diffusion coefficient, resulting in a stronger thermal stratification and making the utilization of chemical heat sink and heat transfer design in the cracking zone of the cooling channel much more difficult. At last, a high operating pressure can alleviate the heat transfer deterioration, but it is not a good choice because of the heavier thermal stratification it brings and limited improvement in lowering the optimum wall temperature.",32,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35782,"The world’s first test facility that allows the visualization of cavitation on a rotating inducer in both cryogen and water was used for comparing the cavitation features in liquid nitrogen at 77.9 K and water at 292.5 and 333.5 K. The test inducer was a triple-threaded helical one with a diameter of 65.3 mm and a rotational speed range of 3500–6000 rpm. The backflow vortex cavitation on the rotating inducer was quantitatively measured in the considered fluids. From the results, it was inferred that the backflow vortex cavitation orbital rate and its orbital diameter around the inducer axis depend on the head coefficient but are almost independent of the cavitation number and kind of fluid. Furthermore, the diameter of each backflow vortex cavitation column depends on the head coefficient, cavitation number, and kind of fluid. At the same head coefficient and cavitation number, the diameter in liquid nitrogen is 2.4 times smaller than that in water because of the thermodynamic effects. Moreover, the appearance of the cavitation is “foggy” in nitrogen and “foamy” in water. This difference can be explained by the maximum stable size of cavitation bubbles derived from the critical Weber number theory. Based on this theory, each cavitation bubble at the tip vortex regions in nitrogen is four times smaller than that in water.",32,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35774,"The pilot flame’s effects on dynamic stability have been investigated in a pilot bluff-body stabilized combustor at atmospheric pressure. During the experiment, the pilot fuel proportion increased from 6 to 20% with an interval of 2%, while the total equivalence ratio remained unchanged. Simultaneous dynamic pressure and unsteady heat release rate measurement and analysis were used to identify and characterize combustion instability modes. Combustion dynamics were captured by a high-speed camera. High-speed images were further analyzed by using proper orthogonal decomposition. With the increase of pilot fuel proportion, the transition between combustion instability modes of 33 and 130 Hz was observed. Based on acoustic mode analysis, the 33 and 130 Hz modes corresponded to the first and second longitudinal acoustic mode, respectively. The results show that the pilot fuel proportion affects the local equivalence ratio distribution in the shear layer and the recirculation zone. As a result, it has significant effects on the dynamics of pilot and main flame interactions, which lead to different unsteady heat release characteristics. Finally, the phenomenon of mode transition occurs when different acoustic modes have been excited.",32,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35629,"This paper reports on the investigation of combustion instabilities in a methane–air non-premixed half-dump combustor for different flow Reynolds number using computational aero-acoustic (CAA) simulation. To simulate the flow physics under turbulent flow conditions, detached-eddy simulation in conjunction with generalized eddy-dissipation model is adopted, while a CAA formulation based on Lighthill’s acoustic analogy is used for computing the acoustic ﬁeld. It is observed that the unsteady pressure signals predominantly arise from either the natural acoustic modes of the duct or the local flow fluctuations in the vortex shedding process downstream of the dump plane, giving rise to different dominant frequencies at different spatial locations at lower and a single dominant locked-on frequency at higher . The nondimensional numbers, that is, Helmholtz and Strouhal numbers, are used to characterize the duct acoustic modes from the vortex shedding modes. Under reacting flow conditions, unsteady heat release and pressure oscillations are monitored to compute Rayleigh index in order to verify if the instability is driving (positive net value) or damping (negative net value) at different frequency levels. Moreover, the predicted Helmholtz and Strouhal numbers are found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data available in the open literature for a wide range of .",32,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35583,"A method named characteristic curve of flame volume is achieved for lean blowout predictions on the basis of the improved Lefebvre’s model and simulated reacting flows. Three main issues are presented: 1) Based on the results from combustion visualization experiments, Lefebvre’s model is improved regarding its universality for combustor configurations. The flame volume near lean blowout obtained from simulated reacting flow is introduced into the model. 2) Characteristic curve of flame volume is a functional curve of flame volume and fuel/air ratio in a certain combustor and is presented as an “” pattern, with ranging from stable operation to nearly engine-off conditions. The region where the fuel/air ratio ranges from 3 to 10 in characteristic curve of flame volume is the unstable combustion region, and nearly all of the lean blowout points fall in this region. 3) According to the relationship between characteristic curve of flame volume expressed as and the improved Lefebvre’s model expressed as , a method named characteristic curve of flame volume is proposed for lean blowout predictions. By the comparison with experimental data on 26 combustors, the lean blowout fuel/air ratios obtained by the characteristic curve of flame volume method fit well with that obtained by experiments, having maximum and average errors of and between predictions and measurements.",32,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35877,"Mixing characteristics of a Mach 2 elliptic jet, with rectangular tabs placed along the major and minor axes are studied, at different levels of nozzle expansion. At all the pressure ratios, the jet with tabs along the minor axis experiences better mixing than the jet with tabs along the major axis. Also, at all the nozzle pressure ratios, the tabs along the major axis retard the mixing promotion, leading to core longer than the uncontrolled jet. For the range of nozzle pressure ratios studied, the mixing promotion caused by the tabs along the minor axis is the most effective for the highest studied overexpansion level corresponding to nozzle pressure ratio 4, leading to a core length reduction of 65%. The least mixing promoting efficiency for this orientation of tabs is found at the marginally underexpanded level of nozzle pressure ratio 8, at which the core length reduction caused is just 5%. The mixing promoting capability of the tabs along the minor axis is found to decrease with decrease in the adverse pressure gradient at the nozzle exit. The contour plots reveal that the tabs along the minor axis bifurcates the jet into two parts, causing faster spreading of the jet along the major axis than along the minor axis. As a result, there is no evidence of axis switching in the jet with tabs along the minor axis. The shadowgraph pictures show that the waves present in the core of the jet with tabs along the minor axis is weaker than the waves in the jet with tabs along the major axis and the uncontrolled jet. Also, the bifurcation of the jet with tabs along the minor axis is clearly captured in the shadowgraph images.",32,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35704,"Forced response is a critical concern in turbomachinery design, as it can quickly lead to high-cycle fatigue failure. However, for modern compressor design programs, it is virtually impossible to remove all resonant crossings that occur within the operating range of the compressor. One option to mitigate these resonant crossings is to break up the strength of the aerodynamic forcing at particular frequencies through the introduction of stator asymmetry. This work investigates the predicted reduction in strength of the vortical forcing function due to stator asymmetry in a three-stage axial compressor. Stator asymmetry is introduced by modifying stator 1 to have unequal vane counts on each stator half. Steady single-passage computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to build representative full-annulus wake structures of the symmetric and asymmetric geometries using total pressure wake profiles downstream of the stator. A Fourier transform of these wake structures compares the frequencies and strengths of the aerodynamic forcing. The introduction of asymmetry in stator 1 reduces the aerodynamic forcing by shifting the symmetric stator harmonics into neighboring frequencies while also reducing the amplitudes of all harmonics. Unsteady full-annulus aeroelasticity simulations quantify the reduction in aerodynamic forcing and the resulting vibrational response of the embedded rotor due to vortical disturbances from a baseline and asymmetric upstream stator.",32,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35334,"The performance and detailed flow physics of a highly loaded, transonic low-pressure turbine stage have been investigated numerically and experimentally. The mean rotor Zweifel coefficient was 1.35, with and a total pressure ratio of 1.75. The aerodynamic design was based on recent developments in boundary-layer transition modeling. Steady and unsteady numerical solutions were used to design the blade geometry as well as to predict the design and offdesign performances. Measurements were acquired in a recently developed high-speed rotating turbine facility. The nozzle-vane-only and full-stage characteristics were measured with varied mass flow, Reynolds number, and freestream turbulences. The efficiency calculated from torque at the design speed and pressure ratio of the turbine was found to be 90.6%. This compared favorably to the mean-line target value of 90.5%. This paper will describe the measurements and numerical solutions in detail for both design and offdesign conditions.",32,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35749,"The poor self-starting ability at low Mach number normally restricts the proper operation of hypersonic inlets within a wide Mach-number range. A fluidic control method with backflow duct based on the flowfield characteristics of the unstart flows is brought forward and investigated through a combination of computational and experimental methods. First, the uncontrolled case is studied. Results show that the baseline inlet does not start until Mach 6.1, which is too high for the researched hypersonic inlet. Then, the controlled case demonstrates that the flow separation is well controlled by means of the closed flow cycle introduced by the backflow duct. Numerical investigations indicate that the self-starting Mach number of the backflow-duct inlet declines to Mach 4.3, and starting status at Mach 5.0 and is observed experimentally. The self-starting ability of the inlet is improved remarkably; meanwhile, at high Mach numbers, the flow structure is barely impacted by the minimal backflow rate, ensuring the high-performance operation of hypersonic inlets.",32,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35811,"This work describes a computational study into lip stall in subsonic civil aircraft intakes and its alleviation by action of the fan. Beyond a certain flow incidence, the lower lip of a civil aircraft intakes stalls. This phenomenon causes entropy and vortical distortions at the fan face. Consequently, it has detrimental effects on vibration levels and performance of the low-pressure compressor system. The most important parameters influencing lip separation are the flight Mach number, the Reynolds number, and altitude. Fully three-dimensional simulations have been performed on a flight intake in current service for which the experimental data are available. Steady and time-resolved simulations have been performed. Distortion coefficients have been evaluated as functions of incidence and have been compared with experimental results. A comparison between an isolated intake and a powered intake shows that the fan stage has the beneficial effect of increasing tolerance to flow incidence and decreasing distortion. The study also shows that, whereas the total pressure deficit at the fan face is a function of incidence, the flow can be represented by a relatively simple vortex system, the strength of which is independent of incidence.",32,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35699,Numerical simulation of the flow in a twin intake via solution to unsteady viscous compressible equations using a stabilized finite-element method has been carried out for various sideslip angles and backpressure ratios. Various flow regimes that are possible in the entire parameter space are identified. They are classified on the basis of shock structure and their locations and the unsteadiness in the flow. Buzz instability is observed in the intake at low system mass rates for nonzero sideslip angles. The onset of buzz is identified by zero mass flow rate in the leeward duct. It is associated with asymmetric movement of the bow shocks upstream of the duct entry. The onset of buzz is accompanied with a loss in static and total pressure recovery and increase in flow distortion. The effect of initial condition is studied. The flow in a certain regime is sensitive to the time history of the backpressure. Hysteresis in the flow as well as in the onset of buzz are observed. The effect of bleed is studied. The amount of bleed and the regions on which it is applied are varied to understand their effect on the performance of the intake. The onset of buzz is delayed with application of bleed.,32,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35640,"A method using circular arcs to generate the divergence contour in a supersonic nozzle is presented. Comparison of the arc-based geometry with existing nozzle contours demonstrated that an average decrease in axial length of 7.5% can be expected when the arc-based design method is applied to a core stage nozzle. Two arc-based and conventional nozzles were evaluated numerically across the pressure operating range of a core stage engine to compare calculated thrust and separation characteristics with existing data. The length-weighted thrust coefficient was increased by 0.3–1.8% in the arc-based design in both configurations. Separated flow characteristics were compared using contours of Mach number and static pressure distributions, which suggested equivalent side loading in the arc-based nozzle at separated flow conditions. The result indicates that a geometric advantage independent of thrust may be achieved when the arc-based method is applied to high-area-ratio nozzle contour design.",32,1

Coupled experimental and numerical cold-flow investigation on the number of cases and aspects was conducted in the framework of a French microsatellite launcher program. Five experimental test nozzles were designed, built, and equipped with diagnostic tools. All experimental test models were supported by full three-dimensional numerical simulations and further investigated using the additional nozzle models, cases, and analysis parameters. Pertinent side force and pitch vector angle of 5–9 deg were achieved within the 5–8% range of the secondary to primary mass-flow-rate ratio. Investigation aspects, categorized as the nozzle vectoring system geometrical characteristics, primary and secondary flow conditions, and gas intrinsic properties were found to dominantly affect the thrust vectoring capabilities. Some further improvements are suggested and achieved in the optimization of selected parameters.",32,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35710,"Fault detection and identification of gas turbines is a crucial process for providing engine safe operation and decreasing the maintenance costs. In studies conducted in the field of global optimization-based gas turbine fault diagnosis, the genetic algorithm as the most well-known evolutionary optimization algorithm is usually employed to identify the engine health parameters. However, because of the evolutionary and stochastic nature of this algorithm, the genetic-algorithm-based diagnosis usually suffers from computational burden and reliability. To mitigate this problem, in the present work, a comparative study has been performed on the global optimization-based gas turbine fault diagnosis, and it is shown that an innovative hybrid optimization algorithm as a fault detection and identification system can significantly enhance the performance of the conventional optimization-based diagnosis systems, even in the presence of measurement noise. The results obtained indicate that the fault detection and identification system based on the hybrid invasive weed optimization/particle swarm optimization algorithm outperforms all the examined diagnosis systems (i.e., the genetic-algorithm-based, particle-swarm-optimization-based, and invasive weed-optimization-based fault detection and identification system) in terms of accuracy, reliability, and especially computational cost. The results demonstrate that the genetic-algorithm-based fault detection and identification system showed the weakest performance among all the examined diagnosis systems.",32,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35520,"A new approach to thrust measurement for pulse detonation engines was developed to account for the effects of system dynamics. The approach was applied to a pulse detonation engine operating at 10 and 20 Hz. System parameters such as steady-state response, effective mass of the combined pulse detonation engine and thrust measurement rig structure, and mass flow rates of the fuel/oxidizer were first determined. The system dynamics of the pulse detonation engine, deconvolved in the frequency domain, was studied. The system’s transfer function between the thrust and a corresponding pressure obtained by a single propagating detonation pressure history during pulse detonation engine operation was established and used to reconstruct the thrust response for pulsed operation. A proper reconstruction of the deconvolved thrust values was accomplished through this technique. The acceleration experienced by the pulse detonation engine thrust measurement rig was also measured. This measured acceleration when multiplied by an empirical effective mass gave an estimate of the inertial force. The estimated inertial force when subtracted from the deconvolved force gave actual thrust. The measured and compensated thrust were expressed in the form of impulse.",32,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35631,"This paper discusses active laser control using a genetic algorithm and a mirror-actuating system to achieve kilometer-order in-air flight using a laser propulsion vehicle while riding a beam. A 10 kg vehicle reaction driven by a strong shock wave is examined using our flight simulator to analyze interaction with unsteady blast wave propagation based on coupling calculation between hydrodynamic simulation of the shock wave propagation and orbital simulation of the vehicle flight motion, and the generated impulses are characterized by the spherically symmetric Sedov solution. Beam-riding flight with an initial offset of 5 mm is successfully sustained by controlling angular offset, while vehicle acceleration is kept low for safe launch to the target altitude. A system delay of laser control is introduced into the flight simulator, and beam-riding flight is maintained for a 20 ms system delay using delay correction following prediction by six-degree-of-freedom equations of motion. This study also examines robustness of the flying technique for wind perturbation, and an active control scheme that can ensure stable flight with a wind of up to . The stability of flight control is assessed when there is a positioning error of laser incident light, and flight is stably sustained by keeping the angular offset small for the positioning error with a standard deviation 1 cm. This paper examines the lower limit of repetition frequency of multiple pulses for stable flight, and found that a repetition frequency exceeding 15 Hz should be selected in order to maintain posture stability. Stable flight is not maintained for the combination of larger system delay and positioning error because translational velocity and angular offset simultaneously increase. However, the vehicle can fly to kilometer-order altitude while maintaining posture stability if the translational and angular impulses are adjusted. Flight performance can be improved by adjusting impulse direction and size using our flight simulator as an impulse design tool.",32,1

The 3.4 kW Aerojet Rocketdyne T-140 Hall effect thruster operating at a discharge voltage of 300 V, a discharge current of 10.3 A, and an anode flow rate of serves as a representative Hall effect thruster test bed. The nominal facility operating pressure during thruster operation is corrected for xenon. Two square aluminum plates are placed adjacent to, but electrically isolated from, the walls of the conductive vacuum chamber at two locations with respect to the center of the thruster exit plane: 4.3 m axially downstream along the thruster centerline, and 2.3 m radially outward centered on the exit plane. The plates and body of the Hall effect thruster are configured in three distinct electrical configurations with corresponding measurements: 1) electrically grounded with measurements of currents to ground, 2) electrically isolated with measurements of floating voltages, and 3) isolated from ground but electrically connected with measurements of the current conducted between the plates. Measurements are taken as the radial position of the cathode is varied from 0 to 129 cm with respect to the nominal cathode location. Measurements of the current collected by the plates and thruster body indicate that cathode electrons preferentially travel to the thruster body, Hall effect thruster plume, and radial facility surfaces for cathode locations in the near field, midfield, and far field, respectively. These results indicate that cathode position alters the recombination pathways taken by cathode electrons in the Hall effect thruster circuit.",32,1
