Entrainment induced by flow unsteadiness, turbulence, and exchange of fluid between the cavity and mainstream flow has been investigated. To clarify the influence of the ratio of cavity length to width on the fluid dynamic behavior, cavities of ratios between two and four were applied at a constant length-to-depth ratio . Acoustic oscillations generated from the cavity were observed to have profound impact on mass exchange between the cavity and the freestream flow. These acoustic oscillations were in turn found to be dependent on the ratio of the cavity. Shift in dominant acoustic mode was observed as the ratio was changed from three to four. Spillage of the shear layer over the cavity walls and turbulence induced in the cavity were probed by measuring velocity using laser Doppler velocimetry. Entrainment of secondary gaseous injection into the main flow from the cavity was also observed to depend on the cavity ratio.",30,5

A novel design of a supersonic model combustor consisting of a two-staged fuel injection system and dislocated dual cavities was proposed to improve the combustor performance, including the combustion efficiency, flame stabilization, combustor “unstart,” and heat release distribution. Specifically, a large number of experiments were performed to systematically investigate the effects of fuel injection distribution, which is controlled by varying the injector spacing and the fuel equivalence ratio, on the static pressure distribution, thrust increment, lean blowout limit, wall temperature distribution, and combustor unstart characteristics. The results show that there exists an optimal range of injector spacing to obtain enhanced combustion performance while avoiding the combustion unstart. Furthermore, the equal fuel injection with an overall equivalence ratio of 0.5 for the two injectors was found to result in the optimal static pressure distribution and hence the largest thrust increment.",30,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35120,"Blowout limits of cavity-stabilized flame of supercritical kerosene were experimentally studied by using Mach 2.5 and 3.0 direct-connect supersonic model combustors operated under various air and fuel conditions. Specifically, the effects of the stagnation temperature and the stagnation pressure on the blowout limits were investigated for supercritical kerosene injected from the wall upstream of a cavity flameholder in a Mach 2.5 combustor. Experiments were performed under the same conditions for supercritical kerosene injected from the rear part of the cavity bottom to study the influence of the location of fuel injection. The blowout limits of supercritical kerosene injected from the wall upstream of the cavity were further investigated in a Mach 3.0 combustor. Besides the effects of the stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure, the effect of the divergence angle of the combustor on the lean-fuel blowout limit was studied. Results show that there exist two blowout limits corresponding to the lean- and rich-fuel conditions for a given stagnation temperature. The location of fuel injection has substantial influence on the blowout limits, whereas the influence of the stagnation pressure and the divergence angle of the combustor can be neglected in the range of interest.",30,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34841,"A miniaturized combustor has been designed that can produce open supersonic methane–air flames amenable to laser diagnostics. The combustor is based on a two-stage design. The first stage is a vitiation burner that provides ignition and flameholding. The design of the vitiation burner was inspired by well-known principles of jet engine combustors. The salient parameters of operation were explored experimentally, and flameholding was verified computationally using a well-stirred reactor model. Both experiments and computations were used to verify a traditional scaling used in jet engine combustor design. The second stage of the combustor generated an external supersonic flame, operating in premixed and partially premixed modes. The equivalence ratio of the external supersonic flame was varied, as well as the total mass flow rate, and the overall flame phenomenology was examined, specifically supersonic flame length. The very high Reynolds numbers and strain rates present in the supersonic flames should provide a useful testbed for the examination of flame suppression and extinction using laser diagnostics.",30,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35138,"An asymmetrical hypersonic inlet cowl lip was numerically studied to explore a new approach of thermal protection. Comparative analyses of the flowfield structure and wall heat transfer with a symmetrical cowl lip were conducted. Results indicate that the peak heat transfer rate to the wall of the asymmetrical cowl lip decreases greatly when an impinging shock intersects a bow shock. Without the impinging shock, the location of the peak heat transfer rate occurs on the wall with a small radius, which does not coincide with the location of the air stagnation point; and the wall peak heat transfer rate of the asymmetrical cowl lip is higher than those of the symmetrical cowl lip, unless the flow attack angle to the wall with a large radius exceeds 12 deg.",30,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35090,"The cowl shock/boundary layer interaction is of great importance to the performance and operability of hypersonic inlets. However, it is usually affected by the expansion waves originated from the convex corner of the ramp surface (often called the shoulder), making the commonly used separation prediction relation unreliable. Therefore, the cowl shock/boundary layer interaction under the interference of the expansion waves is investigated by both theoretical analysis method and computational method in this paper. The results show that the expansion waves bring significant influence on the cowl shock/boundary layer interaction and four kinds of interaction processes exist when their relative position changes. When different interaction processes dominates the flowfield, the expansion waves may bring positive or negative effects on the shock/boundary layer interaction. In particular, while the cowl shock impinges near the shoulder, the interaction processes of shock–shock–expansion wave and shock–expansion wave–shock bring positive effects on the shock/boundary layer interaction and suppress the boundary layer separation.",30,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35067,"An experimental investigation was conducted to study the effect of ambient pressure fluctuations on the dual-bell transition behavior. Ambient or backpressure fluctuations of different frequencies (1.0, 1.5, and 3 Hz) were artificially introduced inside the high-altitude simulation chamber using three magnetic valves. The dual-bell transition behavior was found to be very sensitive to backpressurefluctuations of magnitude , which triggered a flip-flop phenomenon that was observed to continue as long as the fluctuations prevailed. Increasing the throttling-up rate also did not seem to help much in achieving a stable dual-bell transition within the scope of the present tests. This, too, was not favorable, as it can lead to a delay in transition. These test results suggested that the dual-bell nozzle can present problems in real-flight operation, especially when the launcher experiences the buffeting phase of flight. The solution perhaps lies in increasing the dual-bell stability parameter to a value greater than the magnitude of backpressure fluctuations so as to avoid the nozzle pressure ratio range that will set the dual bell into a nonstop flip-flop mode during buffeting.",30,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35227,"The influence of external flow on the plume physics of cell nozzle flows and the cell base wake behavior of simplified clustered linear aerospike nozzles were characterized using surface pressure measurement, flow visualization using the background oriented schlieren method, and theoretical modeling. The test model comprised three or four clustered cell nozzles, or a nonclustered two-dimensional nozzle with a designed Mach number of 3.5, and was connected to a straight section followed by a straight ramp inclined at 12 deg. In the cases with or without external flow, the measured pressure distributions on the surface of the test model were found to be different in the presence of external flow: The ramp surface pressures were maintained at a certain level above the environmental pressure according to the cell nozzle flow conditions, whereas the pressure distributions in the cases without external flow demonstrated highly periodical compression/expansion features. The results of flow visualization indicated that the pressure maintained on the ramp surface depends mainly on how the external flow controls the jet expansion by forming a slip surface. The cell base wake was found to behave as a closed wake in the presence of external flow. Those pressure behaviors were successfully predicted using the physics-based theoretical models established in this study.",30,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35088,"In this endeavor, the transients persisting in a vacuum ejector system are studied by numerically simulating the flowfield and experimentally validating the steady-state results. An inertial effect is discovered in the study due to the recirculation zone moving forward and backward during the transients, and subsequently the pressure in the secondary chamber oscillates. The flow exhibits damped oscillations in which the direction of the mass flux through the secondary chamber keeps changing and finally settles down to a state in which there is no mass flux into or from the secondary chamber. It is seen that the characteristics of the short transients in pressure and mass flux in the secondary chamber depend highly on the thicknesses of the primary and secondary jets and the secondary chamber volume. The inertial effect reduces with the reduction in thicknesses of both primary and secondary jets. As the volume of the secondary chamber increases, the inertial effect decreases further. It is also seen that the inertial effect decreases as the primary jet pressure increases, while other parameters remain constant. The movement of the recirculation zone during these initial transients is also studied in detail and found to be closely related to the mentioned ejector parameters.",30,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34900,"This paper proposes a novel casing treatment, designated a stall precursor-suppressed casing treatment. It is designed to suppress stall precursors to realize stall margin enhancement in turbomachinery. This paper first presents a physical and mathematical model to describe the casing treatment configuration as a wall boundary condition and then establishes the stability equation with its effect. The sensitivity of stall inception to different boundary conditions is considered numerically for both subsonic and transonic axial flow fan/compressors. One important finding from this numerical prediction and analysis is that such a casing treatment can be used to change stall inception even when using a casing treatment configuration with low open area ratio. Thus, a reduction of momentum loss due to recirculating flow can be realized, in comparison with a conventional recessed casing treatment with more than 50% open area ratio. It is thus theoretically possible to design an advanced casing treatment to affect the evolution of stall precursors and finally change stall inception without significantly changing the efficiency of the fan and compressors.",30,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34901,"A stall precursor-suppressed casing treatment is designed to enhance stall margin for both subsonic and transonic compressors. It is noted that the open area ratio of the stall precursor-suppressed casing treatment is only 4–10%, far smaller than conventional casing treatments, with over 50% open area ratio. The effect of the novel casing treatment on the stall margin and efficiency of compressors has been investigated experimentally. The results show that the stall precursor-suppressed casing treatment can improve the stall margin by about 8–18% without significantly decreasing the efficiency of the related fan/compressors. Meanwhile, the present investigation has also attempted to reveal the mechanism of stall margin improvement with such casing treatment. It is found that the stall precursor-suppressed casing treatment will delay the nonlinear development of the stall process by suppressing the propagation of the stall precursor waves, as compared with the evolution of the precursors without casing treatment. This is consistent with the design strategy of the stall precursor-suppressed casing treatment.",30,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35027,"In a high-pressure turbine that is used in combination with a contrarotating low-pressure turbine, the geometry of the low-pressure turbine guide vane gives rise to a shock reflection that has a significant impact on the upstream blade. In consequence, both the performance of the high-pressure turbine and its resistance to high-cycle fatigue failure (i.e., its durability) can be affected. Here, a series of design studies is undertaken in an attempt to mitigate the unsteadiness that arises due to shock interactions in such a turbine. A new method for estimating the forcing function experienced by the high-pressure turbine blade is proposed and evaluated. This method, identified as approximation by surface normal projections, requires only the airfoil geometries and locations as input and demonstrates a significant advantage over an approach to three-dimensional aerodesign consisting exclusively of time-resolved, multirow simulations. The implementation of the approximation by surface normal projections method, in conjunction with a genetic algorithm, is shown to have resulted in superior airfoil geometries with respect to preventing high-cycle fatigue failure and with a reduction of computation time for the analysis of a single airfoil by four orders of magnitude.",30,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35000,"As part of a larger aeroacoustic study focused on rotor–stator interaction noise, the unsteady flow in a single-stage axial compressor is achieved by a numerical Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation. The flowfield is precisely analyzed and assessed by comparing it with available experimental and numerical data. Specifically, the rotor wakes correctly agree with previous laser Doppler anemometry measurements. The unsteady flow, especially the potential effects created by the stator vanes, is then investigated, showing that the stator potential field is responsible for a major secondary tonal noise source on the rotor blades. The rotor wake velocity and turbulent content correspond to the excitations for tonal and broadband noise, respectively. They are greatly influenced by the vane potential effects and, to a lesser extent, by their convection with the mean flow. Two methods of extraction are surveyed along the whole span, showing the need to consider the blockage induced by the stator on the wakes. Finally, the realistic tonal acoustic sources of rotor–stator interaction extracted in time on the stator vane surfaces show a noise mechanism mainly driven by the leading edge and some significant variations from hub to tip.",30,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35044,"The air tab is a new technique with better effects on mixing but minimum penalty on thrust. The present numerical investigation aims to study the mixing effect in the turbofan nozzle. Meanwhile, the parametric studies of the air-tab flow rate and the tube inner diameter of the air tab are also carried out. The thermal mixing efficiency , the total pressure recovery coefficient , and the thrust coefficient are compared to find out the quantitative differences among the models researched. The results reveal that the air-tab technique would increase the thrust a little further rather than create a great penalty on thrust by the jet itself. The thermal mixing efficiency increases greatly from 0.1756 to 0.3425, whereas the high-temperature region (where the temperature is higher than 650 K) is reduced from 29.2 to 5.2% and the thrust coefficient is nearly unchanged, with the air-tab flow rate only about 0.58%. The results also reveal that the depth of penetration cannot determine the thermal mixing efficiency. In addition, there is little difference for total pressure loss among the air-tabbed models at the lobe exit.",30,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35087,"The adjoint method is extended to assess the sensitivity of turbomachinery performance with respect to inlet and exit boundary conditions. The derivation of the adjoint and sensitivity equations are briefly derived in general form, such that they can be applied to any set of flow-governing equations. In this paper, the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations have been used, where the turbulence model has been selected. A compressor rotor blade test case is studied for verification and demonstration of the methodology. The adjoint-based sensitivities are verified using finite differences. The sensitivities of efficiency and pressure ratio with respect to the boundary condition parameters prescribed at each computational grid node at the inlet and exit faces of the blade passage are illustrated in the form of contour plots. Circumferentially averaged values and sensitivities demonstrate that fuller, more uniform profiles lead to improved performance, in line with basic thermodynamic principles. Two examples of modifying either inlet or exit boundary profiles, according to the sensitivity data obtained, show that performance tuning can be achieved. The sensitivity assessment approach presented is shown to be accurate and extremely efficient, while providing the designer with valuable information and insights to achieve a robust design.",30,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35102,"The nonlinear dynamics of fluid instabilities such as rotating stall and surge in axial compressors are typically modeled as subcritical Hopf bifurcations with hysteresis. In this paper, nonlinear dynamical systems with subcritical Hopf bifurcations under periodic forcing are analyzed, and the theoretic results are applied to prediction of rotating stall precursors. Depending on the forcing amplitude and frequency, there are possibly two types of features for the periodic solutions as the bifurcation parameter approaches the critical values. For the first type, the sensitivity of the amplitude of the periodic orbits to the bifurcation parameter becomes infinitely large while the amplitude itself remains finite, which corresponds to the double-cycle bifurcation of the periodic orbits, whereas, in the second case, though the sensitivity is not as steep, there are secondary resonant peaks in the power spectrum in addition to those of the multiples of periodic orbits. These secondary resonant spikes correspond to the Neimark–Sacker bifurcation of periodic orbits, which typically leads to quasi-periodic orbits. These two types of prominent features can serve as precursors to subcritical Hopf bifurcations. The theoretic results are applied to the Moore–Greizter model for rotating stall in axial compressors. In the second part of the paper, experiments are carried out on a single-stage low-pressure axial compressor with inlet circumferential distortions, and it is demonstrated that the theory can yield identification of rotating stall precursors much earlier than the case without distortions.",30,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35103,"In Part 1 of this paper by Dong and Wang ( “ Detection of Rotating Stall Precursors in Axial Compressors via Periodic Perturbation Part 1: General Theory of Nonlinear Dynamics ,” Journal of Propulsion and Power . ), a general theoretic framework is established for prediction of the imminence of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation by using the properties of the dynamic response to periodic and small-amplitude random disturbances. In this paper (Part 2), experiments are carried out on a single-stage low-speed high hub-to-tip ratio compressor by using different levels of static circumferential inlet distortions. Based on the experimental data, a modified Moore–Greitzer model is proposed to accommodate the effects of the distortions on both the mean flow and the first spatial mode. The general theory is then applied to the model, and it is found that the theoretical formula for the sensitivity of amplitude of the first spatial mode to the variation of the bifurcation parameter predicts qualitatively well when compared with numerical simulations and the experiments. By using the sensitivity as the criterion, the imminence of rotating stall can be identified well before its inception, whereas without inlet distortion, the amplification of the first spatial model cannot be detected until at stall inception.",30,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34963,"Modern high-pressure axial turbines of aircraft engines are often transonic. This paper investigates and compares the aerothermal performance of the tip leakage flow of two widely used tips, a flat tip and a cavity tip, in a transonic turbine cascade. Numerical methods were first validated and then used to study different cases. Shock waves appear within the tip gap of a flat tip and have a large effect on the aerothermal performance. Unlike the flat tip, the flow physics within the tip gap of the cavity tip is significantly affected by the cavity vortices, and the effects of the shock waves are small. The impact of tip leakage flow physics on the loss mechanism and heat transfer are investigated. The effects of the relative motion between the blade tip and the casing are also investigated. A tangential viscous force is imposed by end-wall motion and changes the flow physics within the tip gap. Furthermore, a scrapping vortex is formed in the main flow passage due to relative end-wall motion. The scrapping vortex has a large effect on the flow pattern downstream of the cascade.",30,5
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35133,"The effects of atmospheric pressure and temperature variations on the performance of small internal combustion engines operating at altitudes significantly above sea level are not widely documented. Most small internal combustion engines are designed and manufactured for ground-based applications such as chainsaws and lawn mowers. However, these engines are finding application as power sources for remotely piloted aircraft for both hobbyist and military applications. A test stand with the capability to control atmospheric conditions was developed for representative small internal combustion engines. During previous research, data were recorded to identify the impact of varying engine intake pressure on engine performance both with a carburetor and with a throttle body fuel-injection system delivering a gasoline–oil mixture. Using the stand and fuel-injection system, data were collected while varying air temperature along with pressure. Results revealed a decrease in performance (power and brake mean effective pressure) of nominally 4% per 300 m of elevation due to pressure, while improvements of 1% per 300 m were due to temperature effects. This resulted in a nominal 3% loss per 300 m of altitude. These data were then used to establish an updated correction factor for power due to altitude changes. A speed-dependent model was validated for this small engine. These measurements provide a better understanding of small internal combustion engines operation at altitude. Quantifying these effects is vital for establishing the capability of operating spark-ignition engines at altitudes well above those for which they were designed.",30,5

The present investigation explores swirl-venturi lean direct injection combustor fundamentals, characterizing the influence of key geometric injector parameters on reacting flow physics and emission production trends. In this computational study, a design space exploration was performed using a parameterized swirl-venturi lean direct injector model. From the parametric geometry, 20 three-element lean direct injection combustor sectors were produced and simulated using steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes reacting computations. Species concentrations were solved directly using a reduced 18-step reaction mechanism for Jet A. Turbulence closure was obtained using a nonlinear model. Results demonstrate sensitivities of the geometric perturbations on axially averaged flowfield responses. Output variables include axial velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, static temperature, fuel patternation, and minor species mass fractions. Significant trends have been reduced to surrogate model approximations, intended to guide future injector design trade studies and advance aviation gas turbine combustion research.",30,5
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35075,"The plasma plume from a low-power Hall-effect thruster fueled by iodine vapor was characterized with several wetted plasma probes. The plasma source included a laboratory propellant feed system and a laboratory model Hall thruster powered by a breadboard power processing unit. The hollow cathode was fed with xenon. Iodine and xenon ion velocity and energy distributions were measured with an ExB probe, an electrostatic analyzer, and a combined electrostatic analyzer/ExB probe. Multiply charged species were detected in the plume when the thruster was operated with iodine and xenon. Diatomic iodine ions were also detected. The dimer fraction was found to vary with thruster operating conditions and probe location in degrees from the center of the beam. The dimer fraction was also found to decrease as discharge current and voltage increased. With the thruster operating at a discharge potential of 250 V, the fraction of the high-energy ion flux comprised of dimers exceeded 10% over a broad region of the plume at low power. Significant dimer fractions could increase thrust to power by useful amounts at the cost of some overall efficiency.",30,5
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35062,"The electron cyclotron resonance microwave discharge ion thruster , installed in the Japanese asteroid explorer Hayabusa, experienced trouble during a round-trip voyage between Earth and an asteroid due to degradation of the neutralizer. The neutralizer is a critical component limiting the thruster lifetime. The mechanism of the performance degradation is investigated here to find out methods to extend its lifetime for next-generation thrusters. Fault tree analysis during on-the-spot inspections of the neutralizer, previously used for 20,000 h endurance testing on the ground and in experimental simulations, leads to the following proposed degradation mechanism. The internal-surface materials are sputtered by doubly ionized xenon and accumulate on other surfaces, forming thin films containing iron. Next, thermal cycles result in the peeloff of the thin films due to the difference between the thermal expansions of the films and the base plates. Finally, thin films containing iron (that is, ferromagnetic flakes) are magnetically attracted to the tips of the magnetic circuit. These flakes inhibit plasma production, resulting in a performance degradation of the neutralizer. A magnetic circuit covered with molybdenum as a sputtering-resistant material is shown to be effective in prolonging the life of the neutralizer.",30,5

Hall-effect thruster channel wall materials are often binary composites of BN and . The heterogeneity of the material drives the development of complex surface features and roughness during the erosion process. A three-dimensional model of the atomic sputtering of a heterogeneous material is developed. The model investigates, through a ray-tracing technique and empirical erosion rate models of each phase, the interaction between the plasma and the material microstructure. Simulated surface profiles are compared with experimental data collected from the eroded channel wall of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory/University of Michigan P5 Hall-effect thruster. The channel wall is composed of M26, a composite material. Simulated surface features and roughnesses for an ion incidence angle of 30 deg resemble those observed through scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry of the P5 channel wall. Predicted root mean square roughnesses, for 30 deg ion incidence, of are within 33% of the root mean square measured experimentally. The composition of the channel wall surface is investigated via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and is comparable to prior work, but the reduction in the presence of BN with erosion is not adequately captured by this model.",30,5

The beam current of the thruster was increased in previous studies by changing the propellant injection method. In this study, to observe the difference in plasma distributions, optical fiber probes were inserted into the thruster under beam acceleration. The first measurement was laser absorption spectroscopy. By traversing the optical fiber, the number densities of were obtained along the center axis. The second measurement was an electric-optic element probe measurement conducted to measure the intensities of the microwave electric field. Both measurements suggest that there is plasma in the waveguide in the conventional model of the thruster. This phenomenon is possibly caused by the leakage of electrons from the electron cyclotron resonance region to the waveguide. As a result, this paper concludes that the suppression of plasma in the waveguide is a very important measure to improve the performance of microwave thrusters.",30,5

A coupled optimization of motor design and trajectory is needed for such an application due to mission characteristics and motor features. The present article presents a cooperative evolutionary method nested with an indirect approach to perform the coupled optimization of hybrid rocket motor and trajectory for an upper stage. The evolutionary method optimizes the parameters that affect the motor design (e.g., grain geometry) and feed system, whereas the indirect method optimizes the trajectory (i.e., thrust direction and motor switching times) for a given motor and mission. A mission profile based on the Vega launcher is considered and the performance index is the payload inserted into the final orbit. The hybrid rocket motor powers the third and last stage and has a pressurizing feed system that is partially regulated. The characteristics of the first and second solid rocket motor stages are assigned and kept constant, but the whole trajectory is optimized from liftoff to orbit. Different propellant combinations are considered and effects of throat erosion are discussed. Results show that the liquid oxygen/wax propellant combination has the best performance. This combination can be used with a single-port grain and presents a potential gain of about 350 kg with respect to other propellant combinations. Multiport grains must be adopted when more classical fuels are considered, to have acceptable values of the length-to-diameter ratio.",30,5

When the injector’s temperature exceeds the boiling point of the oxidizer under several operating conditions, evaporation will occur at the initial inflow of each pulse. This evaporation phenomenon causes an unsteady two-phase flow that affects ignition and combustion phenomena. In this paper, this abnormal ignition and combustion phenomenon associated with the two-phase flow is investigated through experiments with a single-element injector. Data analysis on the impinging stream instability and the ignition phenomenon reveals that the unsteady oxidizer jet caused by evaporation may act as a trigger for high-frequency instability.",30,5

The first surrogate matched the threshold soot index and average molecular weight of the JP-8; the second matched the threshold soot index and hydrogen-to-carbon; and the third matched the threshold soot index, hydrogen-to-carbon, and derived cetane number. For the second and third surrogates, average molecular weight was within 10% of the estimated average molecular weight of the target JP-8. Soot distributions of JP-8 and its surrogates were compared in wick-fed coflow diffusion flames, and net soot production was compared in a model gas turbine combustor. Line-of-sight and local soot volume fraction measurements were obtained using laser extinction on the wick burner for flames at their smoke point. Line-of-sight soot volume fractions for the fuels were measured at different equivalence ratios in the model gas turbine combustor.

Reported deviations between theoretical predictions and experimental results suggest the need for further refinement of the available models, which can be classified into two groups. First, there are analytical closed-form approaches, the underlying assumptions of which will be discussed regarding their impact on accuracy. Second, there are some numerical, differential approaches. The general applicability of these appears to be limited due to a lack of sufficiently detailed experimental data and due to uncertainties concerning the modeling of the heat transfer. The existing modeling approaches may generally be improved by analytical solutions for the flow pattern and the temperature profile in the gap, which can be obtained, because the flow is found to be essentially laminar. However, inertia effects are not negligible, which results in complex solutions implying a phase shift between mass flow and heat flux. Although presently available solutions do not correctly account for the boundary conditions imposed by the displacer seal yet, further development of such solutions appears to be a most promising way to an improved modeling of the appendix gap losses.",30,5
