Quantitative structural property relationships are classification or regression models that are based on molecular properties. Here, it is shown that electrical conductivity, polarizability, boiling point, viscosity, and other properties can be correlated against descriptors of the ion electron density field. Likewise, the emission mode in colloid thrusters can be classified using similar descriptors.",33,6

The jet and crossflow Reynolds numbers were 1530 and 1399, respectively. The jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio was 0.192. The flame behavior was found to be closely related to the shear-layer vortical flow structures in the near-tube region. Six characteristic flame modes were observed in the domain of jet pulsation intensity . In flame modes 1 and 2 , the shear-layer vortices were dominant. In flame modes 3–6 , the flames were dominated by a puffing bent jet. Vortical structures increased in size with increasing . Temperature and combustion product measurements showed significant improvements in mixing and combustion, as well as a reduction of combustion-induced pollutants at the near-tube region of the flame. However, pulsing the jet flame in crossflow at pulsation intensities greater than 0.9 led to a significant increase in the maximum values of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide concentrations at the middle- to far-tube flame regions. Therefore, strongly pulsing a jet flame in crossflow may not necessarily lead to an improved combustion.",33,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36163,"Aluminum particles are used as a metal fuel to increase the propulsion performance of composite propellants in solid rockets. As such, the combustion mechanism of aluminum has received considerable research attention. Aluminum gas reacts with surrounding oxidizers and creates the diffusion flame. The evaporation time is proportional to the square of the particle diameter, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the temperature difference between the luminous flame and the agglomerated aluminum particle surface. The luminous flame temperature is easily obtained theoretically, but the surface temperature is yet to be obtained experimentally. If the surface temperature could be obtained, the difference between the boiling temperature and the surface temperature of aluminum particles would be clarified. Therefore, it is necessary to study the agglomerated aluminum particle surface. In this study, the dependence of aluminum particle surface on the atmospheric pressure and on the particle diameter is investigated. It is established that the surface temperature is lower than the boiling temperature of aluminum. The mean surface temperature is a constant with respect to the particle diameter from 100 to at 0.1 MPa. Also, it is clarified that the surface temperature is determined by energy balance at aluminum particle surface.",33,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36258,"An experimental investigation was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of a new design for a pulse-width-modulated actuator for flow control in turbomachinery. This new actuator was operated at angular velocities typical for a low-pressure compressor and was used to control the flow on an isolated airfoil. Jet-actuation parameters included the jet momentum coefficient, dimensionless actuation frequency, and operating pressure. Hot-wire anemometry was used to determine the frequency response of the actuator with a pseudoblade representative of a compressor blade, as well as determine the achievable jet momentum coefficients. Flow-control experiments in a low-speed wind tunnel with an instrumented NACA 0015 airfoil were performed to evaluate the ability of the actuator to control flow separation. The experimental data showed that the variation of the jet momentum coefficient with operating pressure and actuation frequency was marginal; therefore, the pulse modulator can operate effectively over a wide range of compressor wheel speeds. The flow-control data showed that flow separation was delayed for the entire range of jet momentum coefficients.",33,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36390,"The authors of this paper introduce a new reconstruction technique titled nozzle-throat reconstruction technique to estimate nozzle-throat-erosion history and oxidizer-to-fuel-mass-ratio history in hybrid rockets. Nine static-firing tests were carried out on a 2kN-class cascaded multistage impinging-jet-type hybrid-rocket motor under varying oxidizer-flow rates to evaluate the accuracy of reconstructed results. Nozzle-throat-erosion histories calculated by the nozzle-throat reconstruction technique agreed well with measured values for initial nozzle-throat radius, and successfully reconstructed the case, in which no measurable amount of nozzle-throat erosion occurred. For equivalence ratios 0.6–1.4, the relationship between nozzle-throat-erosion rate and equivalence ratio of reconstructed results displays a trend consistent with chemical-kinetic-limited heterogeneous-combustion theory, as well as predictions made by previous researchers.",33,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36241,"Hybrid rockets present some disadvantages, mainly low regression rate and combustion inefficiencies. A promising technology to solve both is swirling oxidizer injection, which enhances the wall heat flux and the mixing of the combustion reactants and thus increases the regression rate and the combustion efficiency. A numerical investigation is carried out with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. This type of analysis can really help with the comprehension of the physical phenomena hidden behind the experimental measurement, and so it can be a powerful aid in the preliminary development and testing of hybrid motors. The first step of this numerical investigation is to study the initial motor geometry, increasing the complexity of the system with the addition of each component one by one to better understand which parameters influence the swirling flowfield inside the combustion chamber. Afterward, a comparison between the axial and swirl injection is done, analyzing the qualitative differences in the flowfields and the quantitative ones in the performance. The central and most important part of this numerical study is focused on the inspection of the motor performance related to several scaling parameters.",33,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36425,"A computational thermofluid-dynamic model of hybrid rocket internal ballistics is developed. Numerical simulations of the flowfield in a laboratory small-scale hybrid rocket motor, operated with gaseous oxygen and high-density polyethylene propellants, are carried out with the aim of predicting the solid fuel regression rate experimentally achieved with two different oxidizer injectors. The fuel regression rate is the main parameter for the hybrid rocket design. Here, it is calculated with a detailed gas/surface interface characterization based on local mass and energy balances. The combustion of oxygen and gaseous ethylene injected from the fuel wall is modeled by means of the probability-density-function approach coupled to chemical equilibrium. Two oxidizer-injection configurations, which generate either a two-dimensional axially symmetric or three-dimensional flowfield, are analyzed. The local regression rate is evaluated along both the fuel grain axis and inner circumference in the three-dimensional case, as well as at several stages in the firing, by updating the local port diameter, which is thus not assumed constant. Data retrieved from three firing tests are compared with the numerical results, revealing good agreement between both the average regression rates (maximum deviation less than 5%) and the fuel consumption axial profiles (with maximum deviation of 14%).",33,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36389,"The performance of an electrodeless thruster operating on water-vapor propellant is evaluated and compared to noble-gas propellants. Cross-section data for electron interactions in water vapor are employed to predict the ionization cost as a function of electron temperature. The ionization cost model incorporates energy-loss mechanisms such as dissociation and excitation of rotational modes that are not present for noble-gas propellants. The ionization cost for water is compared to that of traditional noble-gas propellants, such as argon. The characteristics of a water-vapor plasma sheath are discussed and incorporated, along with the ionization cost, into an overall thrust efficiency analysis. Results indicate that comparable performance can be attained for sufficiently high electron temperatures.",33,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36216,"In this paper, lower boundaries at which a liquid-centered swirl coaxial injector switches from nonpulsatile behavior to self-pulsation are experimentally resolved under water and air flow conditions for an element configured both with and without inner post recess. Data-based modal decomposition analyses are used to extract distinct near-field spray dynamics from high-speed schlieren imagery. Self-pulsation is found to be instability-induced by gas–liquid interactions that strip liquid from the contiguous spray cone. These interactions take place in a regime where coaxial flows are known to experience fiber-type breakup due to hydraulic and aerodynamic instabilities. Periodic, nonpulsatile spray breakup patterns are detected as a precursor to self-pulsation. The frequency of these nonpulsatile patterns ranges from and compares well with the frequency of self-pulsation at its onset, which directly supports conventional ideas related to the mechanism of self-pulsation. The transition of spray dynamics from nonpulsatile to self-sustained oscillations shows a destabilizing/stabilizing effect as gas velocity increases, establishes temporally unstable spray oscillation at onset, and suggests that self-pulsation may be excited when stripping behavior engages one or more fluid oscillators of the injector element.",33,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36314,"This work makes an attempt to determine an effective streamwise and spanwise arrangement of a relatively novel control device, the sub-boundary-layer slotted vortex generator, having a slot radius of 60% of device height, to minimize the flow separation in a realistic mixed-compression inlet geometry. The inlet considered for the simulations is based on the experiments conducted by S. Emami et al. at NASA Langley Research Center at Mach 4.03 to determine performance of an inlet/isolator configuration. The present work uses a computational domain based on one such inlet configuration, having the smallest-sized cowl and a large convergence angle, to produce a strong cowl-lip shock. Results indicate that the extent of flow separation gets successively reduced, as the device trailing edge is moved closer to the interaction region. It is also observed that the inlet width determines the optimal spacing of the device, and that in presence of sidewall boundary layers, the device performs better when positioned closer to the inlet center plane than the sidewall. The computations in this work are performed using the REACTMB code, suitable for high-speed turbulent flows. The turbulence model used is Menter's shear stress transport model.",33,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36402,"A plasma-assisted combustion (PAC) test platform for annular combustor fan-shaped test piece was developed to validate the feasibility of using PAC actuation to enhance annular combustor performance. Comparing experiments between conventional combustion (CC) and PAC were conducted where combustion efficiency, flue gas emissions, and outlet temperature distribution were measured. The performance of present method under different combustor excessive air coefficients were also evaluated. Compared with the test results of CC of fuel-rich, approximate stoichiometric ratio and fuel-lean kerosene/air mixtures, when PAC actuation was exerted with applied voltage of 10.1 kV, combustion efficiencies increased by 1.32, 1.52, and 2.03%, respectively; CO emissions reduced 43, 103, and 48 ppm, respectively; outlet temperature distribution coefficients decreased by 23.06, 22.04, and 11.46%, respectively; emission from fuel-rich mixture combustion reduced 20 ppm, whereas it increased 41 and 5 ppm, respectively, for approximate stoichiometric ratio and fuel-lean kerosene/air mixtures; radial temperature distribution coefficients decreased by 25.71 and 22.50%, respectively, for fuel-rich and approximate stoichiometric ratio mixtures; however, it increased by 3.24% for fuel-lean mixture. The results lead to potential directions for the future optimization of kerosene-fueled aero-engine when using plasma-assisted combustion devices to enhance annular combustor performance.",33,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36261,"A premixed supply of fuel and oxidizer was fed through five concentric feed slots and detonated in a rotating detonation engine, representing the first known successful airbreathing premixed rotating detonation engine. The premixed feed system successfully arrested flashback. An operating map was constructed and compared to a nonpremixed rotating detonation engine. Mixing effects were shown to be important by comparing measured wave speeds to theoretical Chapman–Jouguet detonation velocities, published computational fluid dynamics results, and similar nonpremixed rotating detonation engines. High-speed imagery indicated that the wave speed measurements should account for the circumferential velocity of the gases relative to the detonation and that the Chapman–Jouguet calculation should account for partial mixing with combustion products.",33,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36356,"Turbomachinery blade passages are conventionally meshed by sweeping a mesh from a reference stream surface to other stream surfaces along the blade span. This approach is widely used in the gas-turbine industry, but it becomes problematic for simulations where the flow close to the endwall region is important. This is due to the fact that this approach has to make geometrical approximations for endwall features. This paper presents a method that overcomes this difficulty and generates optimal meshes for blade passages without geometrical approximations. The robustness of the method is demonstrated by meshing a multistage compressor with shroud cavities. Simulations of the compressor show the penalty of using meshes with approximated endwall features and the benefit of using meshes generated by the current method. These demonstrate that the proposed method contributes to the improvement of computational fluid dynamics as a reliable design tool for turbomachines.",33,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36359,"The authors have previously proposed the concept of end-burning-type hybrid rockets, which would use cylindrical fuel grains consisting of an array of many small ports running in the axial direction, through which oxidizer gas would flow. Because of difficulty in manufacturing a fuel grain that satisfied requirements such as high volumetric filling rate (above 0.95) and microsized port intervals, the end-burning hybrid rocket had yet to be achieved. This paper reports the results of verification firing tests of a novel end-burning-type hybrid rocket made possible for the first time by recent progress in three-dimensional printing technology. The results clearly distinguish the initial transient and steady periods of the end-burning mode and prove that no oxidizer-to-fuel ratio shift occurs during firing. Because the initial transient is a period for the exit end face to attain a steady-state shape, an initial end-face shape being close to the steady-state shape can shorten this period. A firing test with fuel having tapered ports is shown to attain a steady-state shape in less than 1 s, which is much shorter than the nontapered case of about 6 s.",33,6
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36257,"The paper discusses the time-averaged flow of a new-concept turbine transition duct placed in a two-stage counter-rotating test turbine. As a possible architecture for the turbine transition duct of future engines, the structural vanes carrying the bearing loadings can be integrated with the first low-pressure vane row in one aerodynamically optimized wide-chord vane called the turning midturbine frame. To increase the flow uniformity and to decrease the unsteady content of the flow, a baseline turning midturbine frame is redesigned by embedding two splitter vanes into the strut passage. The discussion on the flowfield is based on numerical results obtained by computational fluid dynamics and validated by aerodynamic measurements. In particular, the splitters are seen playing a major role in suppressing the big structures generated by the struts and the secondary flows of the high-pressure turbine. On the other hand, new losses are introduced by the splitters. Such structures play a decisive role in the overall component performance; therefore, their effect should be properly understood. This work provides a deep insight into the flow physics of an embedded turning midturbine frame for next-generation aeroengines, which is seen as a promising architecture in order to compact the engine size while keeping component performance high. The present work can be considered as a first attempt to implement splitter blades into an already existing turning midturbine frame design, and its value lies in a thorough experimental and computational study on the losses and benefits of such a design.",33,6
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36155,"To construct a stability estimation tool for injection-coupled instability in rocket engines, a linear stability analysis was applied. The amplifying factor related to injector-element acoustics and the damping factor related to chamber acoustics were defined. A complex vector, which is a function of these factors, was introduced. The stability for gain and that for phase were defined by the vector, and the bulk stability was defined by these stabilities. Because of time-lag findings obtained from subscale firing tests, the instability index, which was defined as inverse of the bulk stability, was defined only by the stability of gain. To validate the tool, the stability of cryogenic oxygen/hydrogen firing tests with a full-scale chamber was rated. The average acceleration was applied as an instability index for the firing tests. By setting the instability index by the tool at as the threshold that divides “unstable” and “stable,” the stability obtained by the tool and that of the firing test showed a good correlation for three test cases. In the fourth test case, the tool could not re-create the test result. In conclusion, the present tool can detect an instability that is dominated by gains rather than by time lags.",33,6
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36543,"A hypersonic expansion tube facility was designed and constructed to primarily study supersonic combustion phenomena. This paper provides an overview of the range of conditions the facility is capable of generating along with a discussion on how well a number of parameters required to accurately replicate conditions for supersonic combustion are achievable. A series of experiments using three low-to-mid enthalpy conditions were used to characterize and assess the extent of impact that flow-nonidealities have on the final test gas properties. Aspects such as shot-to-shot repeatability, temporal and spatial test gas uniformity, boundary-layer properties, and the presence of flow disturbances are analyzed. The shot-to-shot variation in the measured shock speeds corresponded to acceptable bulk variations of the aerothermodynamic properties of the test gas flow. Temporally, both the static and total pressures increased over the test gas slug, offsetting each other in a manner that kept the inferred test gas Mach number constant. Spatially, it was found that the core flow size increases with increasing test gas pressure and to a first order can be approximated to span of the pipe diameter for the range of conditions considered. The presence of test gas flow disturbances was found to be negligible as the conditions studied exhibited a weak frequency focusing effect. Lastly, an improved method of acquiring high signal-to-noise ratio static pressure measurements in such impulse facilities was demonstrated to reduce measurement noise by as much as 70%.",33,6
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36291,"Schlieren images and unsteady pressure measurements were collected to explore the response of a shock train to a high-frequency fluctuating backpressure in an isolator. High-frequency excitations (between 105 and 225 Hz) were applied in the downstream of an isolator, thus leading a forced shock train oscillation. The experimental results show that the fundamental frequency of a shock train oscillation is very close to the excitations, and the shock train motions can be judged by pressure measurements. The whole isolator can be divided into three parts, including the undisturbed zone, the shock train oscillation zone, and the backpressure-affected zone. Different cases of forcing frequencies were studied, and it is found that the amplitude of the shock train oscillation increases with the decreasing excitation frequency. Moreover, the most upstream position of shock train motions is not located at the place where the maximum standard deviation occurs under fluctuating backpressure condition. Thus, the maximum standard deviation method can no longer be used for shock train leading edge detection. Actually, the most upstream position of the shock train leading edge is located at the place where the excited frequency content disappears or the place where the oscillation amplitude decreases to near zero.",33,6
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36361,"Thermomechanical fatigue panels represent small actively cooled sections of the hot-gas wall of a regeneratively cooled liquid rocket engine. In combination with cyclic laser heating, the panels are used to study both the fatigue life and thinning and bulging phenomena (the so-called doghouse effect) without the need for testing a full-scale engine. To improve the prediction of the thermomechanical fatigue panel’s fatigue life, a viscoplastic model coupled with isotropic damage and thermal aging was implemented. The temperature-dependent material parameters are determined using experimental data to take into account softening effects due to material degradation. The number of cycles to failure is computed numerically and compared to the results of a thermomechanical fatigue panel test. The damage parameter-based finite element analysis successfully predicts the damage initiation point in the middle cooling channel of the thermomechanical fatigue panel. Critical damage occurs at the 150th cycle, whereas the failure is experimentally observed at the 174th cycle. The effect of the increase of the wall thickness in the fin areas is also obtained by this numerical analysis. This study shows that cost-efficient thermomechanical fatigue panel tests have the potential to validate numerical fatigue life predictions for novel rocket combustion-chamber wall materials.",33,6
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36432,"A low-order analytical performance model for the rocket-mode rotating detonation engine was developed. Starting from the general form of the continuity, momentum, and energy equations and integrating over an annular control volume, expressions for the resultant force in the axial and circumferential directions were formulated and used to calculate a range of performance metrics including thrust, specific impulse, relative force ratio, and mean exit swirl angle. This model was then used to conduct a parametric analysis of the rotating detonation engine to determine the effect of varying several engine design parameters on performance. Increased propellant pressure, lower propellant temperature, and zero injection swirl were found to increase performance. Wider and shorter annuli offered increased thrust and specific impulse. Exit swirl was seen to be nonzero for the majority of design iterations, resulting a resultant torque on the control volume. However, some zero-torque points were observed, which may prove especially valuable in design optimization endeavors. The present results agree qualitatively with reported numerical simulations.",33,6

Nominal test articles were tested using nominal fuel pore sizes. Pressures tested ranged from 207 to 1054 kPa, and oxidizer injection velocities ranged from 7.5 to . Regression rates were determined using pretest and posttest length measurements of the solid fuel. Experimental results supported previous work demonstrating that the regression rate of the porous axial-injection, end-burning hybrid was a function of the chamber pressure as opposed to the oxidizer mass flux typical in conventional hybrids. Regression rates ranged from approximately at 207 kPa to at 1054 kPa. The experimental results were compared to an analytical model developed in previous work for qualitative agreement. The model showed qualitative agreement with the experimental results, indicating that it has potential for giving insight into the flame structure in this propellant combination.",33,6
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36212,"The effects of mainstream turbulence intensity on the film-cooling effectiveness of antivortex film-cooling holes were experimentally investigated. Four film-cooling hole configurations and three mainstream turbulence intensities (1, 6.5, and 16) were tested. The primary film-cooling hole had a 30 deg angle with respect to the mainstream flow, and the angles between the primary and auxiliary holes of the antivortex holes were 0, 15, and 30 deg, respectively. The film-cooling effectiveness was measured using pressure-sensitive paint technique. The particle image velocimetry measurement results showed that the coolant from the antivortex film-cooling hole stayed closer to the endwall than that for the cylindrical hole case. The film-cooling effectiveness for the antivortex hole cases was higher than that for the cylindrical hole case for all blowing ratios. For the antivortex hole cases, the coolant-covered area generally increased as the blowing ratio increased. For the high mainstream turbulence intensity case, the higher blowing ratio cases showed greater film-cooling effectiveness due to the dragdown of the coolant. Among the tested configurations, the 15 deg antivortex hole case showed the best film-cooling performance at all blowing ratios and turbulence intensities.",33,6
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36602,"In this work, a three-dimensional intake model was investigated in a blowdown wind tunnel and results were compared and complemented with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. The intake model was equipped with a movable cowl with which the internal contraction ratio was set to the self-starting limit. Three different conditions were investigated: first, a v-shaped cowl geometry at a freestream Mach number of seven; second, a straight cowl geometry at a freestream Mach number of seven; and, finally, a v-shaped cowl geometry at a freestream Mach number of six. Furthermore, a one-dimensional postanalysis was performed to calculate overall engine parameters from stream-thrust-averaged intake performance parameters. Numerical results were within the experimental uncertainty, except for small displacements near separation regions. The mass capture ratio of the v-shaped cowl was slightly higher as compared to the straight cowl. When increasing the Mach number from six to seven, the specific impulse dropped from 2561 to 2100 s, respectively. For the Mach 7 configurations, a maximum sustainable backpressure ratio of approximately 115 was measured. For the Mach 6 case, the maximum sustainable static backpressure ratio dropped to about 85. The maximum sustainable backpressure to operating backpressure ratio was around 4:1, and it was independent of the Mach number.",33,6

This study also examines the fuel-rich combustion behavior of ammonium-perchlorate-added fuels to different chamber pressures, radial temperature profiles, and overall system specific impulses. To maintain the hybrid rocket engine advantages, an upper limit of ammonium perchlorate is set to be 15 wt % in solid fuel. The results proved that an ammonium perchlorate addition to solid fuel provided better controllability of effluent temperature and 4% less oxidizer-to-fuel variation. The results also suggested that, when adding ammonium perchlorate, it offered 60% less chamber pressure, 120 K reduced radial temperature variation, and 3% improved overall specific impulse while generating the same effluent temperature.",33,6
