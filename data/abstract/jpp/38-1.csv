1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38293,A design method for three-dimensional shape transition scramjet nozzles is introduced. The method employs streamline tracing to capture the properties of an axisymmetric thrust nozzle in a complex three-dimensional shape that allows for airframe integration and side-by-side mounting of scramjet engine modules. A contoured centerbody is added to an established maximum thrust nozzle and used as the axisymmetric parent flowfield. This allows for tailoring the shape of the nozzle to a variety of vehicle geometries while at the same time eliminating drag producing surfaces traditionally encountered in this type of nozzle. The design procedure is described and applied to the design of a nozzle for a Mach 12 scramjet engine at an off-design condition. An inviscid computational fluid dynamics analysis of the nozzle is used to analyze the accuracy of the capture of the parent flowfield’s properties. It is found that despite the shape transition the nozzle is able to reproduce the interior flow of the axisymmetric flowfield.,38,1
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38259,"Particle image velocimetry measurements have been carried out in a low-pressure turbine cascade operating under unsteady inflow to deeply investigate reduced frequency and flow coefficient effects on flow dynamics, and, consequently, on loss generation in the boundary layer and in the core flow region. Two independent measuring setups have been used for the purpose. The first one captured a large view of the entire blade passage, thus allowing the observation of the incoming wakes and related large-scale vortices developing in the core flow region. The second setup was instead focused on the rear part of the blade suction side to analyze the boundary layer development and to observe the mechanisms dominating the wake–boundary- layer interaction. Tests were performed for four flow cases, varying the reduced frequency and the flow coefficient independently. Proper orthogonal decomposition has been applied to quantify the turbulent kinetic energy production in the core flow, due to wake dilatation and distortion, and in the boundary-layer region. Upstream wake migration and boundary-layer-related losses are consequently quantified from particle image velocimetry data and compared with total pressure measurements for the different combinations of the inflow parameters, providing a clear view of the different loss sources affecting the unsteady operation of low-pressure turbine cascades.",38,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38280,"Two-fluid atomization of highly viscous and shear thinning non-Newtonian fluids must overcome the viscous resistance. Conventional air-blast atomizers address this requirement by operating at higher gas–liquid mass ratios (GLRs) at the cost of deteriorated efficiency. In this investigation, the atomization efficiency of a two-fluid atomizer is characterized. Fluidic design of the atomizer reduces the viscosity-induced dampening of disruptive inertia force and speeds up the breakup by providing kinetic energy of strategically positioned microjets of air. Three fluids of different viscosities and surface tensions were tested to examine the effects of properties on atomization efficiency. The presence of droplets and ligaments near the exit plane of the atomizer revealed that the atomizer enables prompt breakup of fluids without appreciable delay by viscosity. Consequently, it could break up complex non-Newtonian Jet A1 gel propellant with efficiency in the range of 0.015–0.1. Moreover, it is also capable of atomizing Newtonian fluids like water (high surface tension) with efficiency of 0.06–0.1 and Jet A1 (low surface tension) with efficiency of 0.02–0.08. Note that varied as ( to ) for the liquids tested in this work. The results of this investigation show that the deterioration in the performance of internally impinging atomizers at higher air and liquid throughputs is not determined by the viscosity of liquid but is predominantly due to the loss in kinetic energy of the excess air.",38,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38080,"The performance of a three-channel, 100-kW nested Hall thruster was evaluated on xenon propellant for total powers up to 102 kW. The thruster demonstrated stable operation in all seven available channel combinations at discharge voltages from 300 to 500 V and three different current densities. The resulting test matrix contained forty-six unique conditions ranging from 5 to 102 kW total power and 16 to 247 A discharge current. At each operating condition, thrust, specific impulse, and efficiency were characterized. All seven channel combinations showed similar performance at a given discharge voltage and current density. The largest thrust recorded was at discharge voltage. Total efficiency and specific impulse ranged from 0.54 to and from 1800 to 2650 s s, respectively. Discharge current oscillations were also characterized with peak-to-peak values and with high-speed camera analysis, which provide insight into how the discharge channels oscillate and how those oscillations are affected by the presence of other operating channels. These results are discussed in the context of differences between single- and multichannel operation, as are the implications for the general viability of nested Hall thruster technology for future mission applications.",38,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38283,"This study provides an experimental analysis of the throttling methods implemented using a throttleable injector that generates a thrust in the range 24–64% on a 50 N monopropellant thruster using 90 wt.% hydrogen peroxide and . The injector proposed in this study is a dual-plate injector. It is capable of controlling the mass flow rate using radial slotted and showerhead-type plates. The slotted plate was rotated and pressed against the showerhead-type plate by intersecting a number of injection ports to control the mass flow rate. Firing tests were conducted over the throttling range to verify the feasibility of the concept of the dual-plate injector. The experimental data of the injectant flow rate and chamber pressure were analyzed parametrically. It was observed that the dual-plate injector had a characteristic velocity in the range 81–97% depending on the range of thrust. In addition, a correlation was observed between the characteristic velocity efficiency and response time of the injector under varying injection conditions; that is, the characteristic velocity tends to increase with a decrease in the response time. The result can be applied to optimal control systems, and also be used to execute advanced missions accurately using a monopropellant thruster.",38,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38374,"A rotating detonation engine (RDE) generates a continuous thrust with one or more rotating detonation waves. Because of the velocity on the order of kilometers/second, the reaction zone is relatively small. Therefore, the RDE realizes a short combustion chamber length. However, the detonation waves induce an azimuthal motion of propellant, resulting in torque around the thrust axis. Because the motion does not contribute to the thrust, the torque is important in terms of performance loss. Herein, we conducted combustion tests with a six-axis force sensor to simultaneously measure torque and thrust. A comparison of detonation waves captured by high-speed camera revealed that the torque followed the direction and was offset when the waves existed in both of two directions simultaneously, which indicates the possibility of controlling the torque. Under a mass flow rate at and an equivalence ratio at , when the azimuthal component of shear force was of the thrust, of the total kinetic energy of the exit flow was distributed to the azimuthal component of velocity and did not contribute to the thrust. We therefore concluded that the effect of the azimuthal motion on the RDE’s performance was small.",38,1

In an extensive measurement campaign, conducted in a blowdown wind tunnel at Mach 7, the operational behavior of this inlet was characterized. The parameters investigated include internal contraction ratio, Reynolds number, angle of attack, and angle of yaw, and the starting behavior was examined. Static and total pressure ratios and mass capture ratios were used to evaluate the performance of the inlet and throttle curves to determine the operational limits. The flowfield was studied by schlieren images, wall pressure distributions, and Mach number profiles in the interface of the isolator and combustion chamber, which were determined with a pressure measurement rake with static and pitot pressure probes. The flow on the external ramp was analyzed by infrared thermography. The inlet showed good performance regarding compression and efficiency and proved to be quite robust at various flight angles. The performance tended to improve, and the inlet operated more stably with increasing internal contraction, with the most important factor being whether the inlet leading-edge shock was captured by the cowl.",38,1

However, for small unmanned aerial systems, potential gains in range and endurance can depend significantly on the aircraft flight profile and powertrain control logic. Subsequently, these impact the performance of individual powertrain components. This study uses dynamic simulations of an unmanned aerial system (UAS) with different powertrain control logic approaches to evaluate the performance of a series hybrid–electric powertrain. Component models generated using lookup table approaches and model parameterization are combined to generate a dynamic system model of the unmanned aerial system. The performance of the powertrain is evaluated for three representative mission profiles. Fuel consumption and battery state of charge form two metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of a baseline controller against an ideal operating line strategy. The ideal operating line strategy, which uses a performance map obtained by engine characterization on a specialized dynamometer, produces an average fuel economy improvement ranging from 0.5–2.0 g/km for a 30-min-long mission profile. The study demonstrates the need to consider a dynamic analysis aided by detailed component performance maps and a robust control strategy in evaluating hybridization approaches for UAS powertrains.",38,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38081,"The plasma plume properties of a three-channel 100-kW-class nested Hall thruster were measured on xenon propellant for total powers up to 80 kW. The thruster was throttled through all seven available channel combinations for conditions spanning 300 to 500 V discharge voltage and three discharge current densities. A plasma diagnostics array, which included a Wien filter spectrometer, a retarding potential analyzer, and a planar Langmuir probe, was placed in the far-field plume of the thruster and used to measure the beam ion charge state, the ion energy distribution function, and the local plasma potential. These data were used to calculate thruster phenomenological efficiencies. These efficiencies are compared across the discharge voltage and channel combination, and they are compared to similar results from the NASA-300M single-channel high-power Hall thruster. An estimate of cross-channel ingestion, which is a phenomenon in the nested configuration that may improve thruster efficiency and that will be present in space, is calculated, and the results for mass utilization efficiency are corrected for this effect. These plasma diagnostic results are discussed in the context of the state of the art, as well as in that of the viability and potential benefits of the nested channel thruster configuration.",38,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38266,"Combined with a common fuel binder, solid hypergols can simplify the overall complexity of hybrid rocket engines, as the fuel grain can be ignited and reignited without any external power source or external fluid. Also, with the hypergolic additive embedded in the binder, the flame zone could be placed at the surface of the grain itself, thereby providing heat to the grain to maximize regression rate and promote combustion sustainability. The objective of this study was to demonstrate hypergolic ignition and successive relights of a 2-in motor grain configuration, with a paraffin-based fuel and MON-3 (3 wt % nitric oxide in nitrogen tetroxide) as the oxidizer. With sodium amide and potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide as solid hypergolic additives, the study focused on the influence of the additive type, loading, location, and format on the grain ignition delay and combustion sustainability. Hypergolic ignition was achieved with grain configurations composed of a front segment with 90 wt % additive and the main grain with loadings of additive from 40 down to 0 wt %. Two-s single burn tests provided regression rate estimates for the different grain combinations. Grain ignition delays varied between and , depending on the grain configuration, with efficiencies between 64% and 98%.",38,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38104,"Small, low-thrust, long-burn-time solid propellant rocket motors could provide propulsion for a new class of kilogram-scale, transonic, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper investigates technological challenges of small, low-thrust solid rocket motors: slow-burn solid propellants, motors that have low thrust relative to their size (and thus have low chamber pressure), thermal protection for the motor case, and small nozzles that can withstand long burn times. Slow-burn propellants were developed using ammonium perchlorate and 0–20% oxamide (burn-rate suppressant), with burn rates of at 1 MPa. Using these propellants, a low-thrust motor successfully operated at a thrust/burn area ratio 10 times less than that of typical solid rocket motors. This kilogram-scale motor can provide 5–10 N of thrust for 1–3 min. An ablative thermal protection liner was tested in these firings, and a new ceramic-insulated nozzle was demonstrated. This paper shows that small, low-thrust solid motors are feasible and presents a baseline design for the integration of such a motor into a small UAV.",38,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38127,"Closer integration between the airframe and the propulsion system is expected for future aircraft to reduce fuel consumption, emissions, weight, and drag. The use of embedded or partially embedded propulsion systems will require the use of complex intakes. However, this can result in unsteady flow distortion, which can adversely affect the propulsion system efficiency and stability. Relative to conventional measurement systems, time-resolved particle image velocimetry provides sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to enable the development of new methods to assess unsteady flow distortion. This work proposes a novel analysis approach to assess the unsteady flow distortion. For an S-duct configuration, the method was successfully used to evaluate the perturbations of the indealized incidence angle. This example showed peaks up to incidence and a duration equivalent to the passing time of three blades. The introduction of a nonuniform total pressure profile at the S-duct inlet increased the probability of peak distortion events with higher magnitude. The method provides an estimate of the likelihood, magnitude, and duration of distortion events and is a new way to evaluate flow distortion that could induce instabilities for the propulsion system.",38,1

The propellant flows through multiple layers of cylindrical shells, with this structure also functioning as a single-piece heater. A 6-cm-high cylinder was realized with a wall thickness of 0.2 mm, using Inconel 718. A nodal thermal analysis was performed to identify the upper-limit current at a temperature limit of the wall material, and it was revealed that an outlet gas temperature of 871 K can be achieved with 77 A of current at 0.2 g/s of mass flow rate. The designed heater was combined with a boron nitride insulator and a stainless-steel housing, and thrust was measured in a vacuum chamber with nitrogen as the propellant. At a mass flow rate of and 75 A of current, an outlet temperature of 747 K, a specific impulse of 108 s, and a heater efficiency of 72% were achieved. These results with nitrogen propellant were used to predict the performance of a tungsten-made resistojet with a hydrogen propellant, and a specific impulse of over 700 s can be expected at a heater temperature of 2000 K.",38,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38348,"The response and performance of an aeroelastic hypersonic intake was studied experimentally using fundamental geometry and structural boundary conditions. The experiments were conducted in a hypersonic wind tunnel at a Mach 5.85 condition. The most relevant deforming component was the compression ramp, which was treated as a cantilever surface to emulate the global deformation of the intake. Flowfield measurements were performed using pressure transducers, pressure-sensitive paints, and schlieren flow visualization. The dynamic structural response was measured using digital image correlation as well as feature tracking from the schlieren videos. A point measurement of total pressure in the isolator was taken using a pitot tube to quantify the effects of intake ramp deformation on the intake performance. The loss of total pressure in the isolator was found to correlate directly with the intake ramp deformation, with a direct transient correlation between the peak loss in total pressure recovery and the peak ramp deformation. While undergoing aeroelastic deformation, the total pressure recovery of the cantilever compliant ramp decreased by up to 20% from the baseline values. The analysis showed a strong coupling, along with hysteresis in dynamic response, between the intake structural deformation and the shock-wave/boundary-layer flowfield in the isolator.",38,1
