0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34273,"This work presents a numerical simulation of a four-stage axial compressor with cantilevered stators and repeating stages. Two simulations have been accomplished, namely, unsteady with sliding plane and steady with mixing plane, over a wide range of operating conditions. The solver is an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes code with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulent model. It has been found that the greatest effect of unsteadiness is near the end walls. The stall point for the unsteady simulation is 40% closer to the experimental data when compared with the steady one with mixing planes. This is due to the recovery and segregation of the rotor tip vortex near the casing, which has a stabilizing effect in terms of stall limit. The unsteady simulation is able to reproduce total pressure loss experimentally observed near the hub at the stator exit but not found in the steady simulation. A previous experimental campaign suggested this loss was generated by the wakes of upstream inlet guide vanes propagating through the machine. However, this work found that it is generated by the migration of hub leakage flow induced by the incoming rotor wakes. The unsteady simulation shows higher performance at midspan. This has been found to be related to the rotor wake rectification with a 70% inviscid recovery of wake.",29,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34481,"Statistically, there has been an increased rate of common fracture failure in compressor blades of heavy-duty gas turbines installed at a seaside power plant. Investigations show that corrosion and pitting on the surface of the blades are sources of initial cracks. Therefore, reasons for the corrosion pit initiation are investigated in this paper. In this respect, experimental and numerical analyses are dedicated. Chemical analysis reveals that the blade material is the AISI Custom 450 grade martensitic stainless steel (C450), which has low pitting resistance due to small corresponding pitting resistance equivalent number. Energy dispersive analysis by X-ray shows a high amount of halide elements in the pit zones. To determine the source of water droplets that assist the pitting corrosion, moisture variations in the compressor are studied. Results show that air moisture is condensed in the prior stages of the compressor, especially on the pressure side of the first stage rotating blades. Regarding the results of investigations, it is concluded that the source of pit initiations are condensate water and halide deposition on blade surfaces during compressor operation.",29,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34601,"The mixing mechanisms downstream of an axisymmetric 12-lobed mixer are studied through a combined experimental and computational investigation. A series of simulations based on the unsteady Navier–Stokes equations are used to identify the relative roles of large-scale, instability-driven transient flow structures and smaller-scale turbulence on the flow development within and downstream of the lobed mixer. Medium- and large-scale unsteady motions are captured by the fine spatial and temporal resolution of the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations, and small-scale turbulence is captured using shear-stress transport and scale-adaptive shear-stress transport turbulence models. The simulations are validated against four-wire thermal anemometry measurements in a scaled lobed-mixer wind-tunnel model with turbulent, axial inflow conditions. Favorable agreement between the measured and simulated flowfields demonstrates the predictive capability of the simulations. The simulation results illustrate the creation of streamwise vorticity in the lobes and its subsequent interaction with the spanwise vorticity shed from the trailing edge of the lobed mixer. The extent of this interaction is shown to strongly affect the mixing of the flow downstream of the lobed-mixer discharge plane. The results also illustrate that the large-scale transient flow structures are significantly weakened by smaller-scale turbulence present in the flow, establishing the role of smaller-scale turbulence in mixing the flow downstream of the lobed mixer.",29,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34596,"The aim of this work is to provide an upper estimate of the theoretical maximum efficiency and specific impulse of the external burning scramjet. Contrary to the classical Carnot and Brayton cycles for the heat and gas-turbine engine and the known ideal cycle for the ramjet, in this case there is not a reversible cycle to provide a reference. The reason for this is that the heat release to the high-speed flow is accompanied by inherent total pressure losses, and thus the process results are irreversible. Subsequently, to estimate the maximum efficiency an idealized optimization problem inevitably must be analyzed that also takes into account these inherent losses. This optimization problem was solved 1) in the linear approximation, valid for thin bodies and small amounts of applied heat, and 2) in the nonlinear formulation but in the original framework of heat release in the jet stream with a “zero mass flux” condition. The results obtained in the two cases are comparable for small heat release, but they diverge as the applied heat increases, mainly for the additional total pressure losses in the generated shock waves. It is shown that the maximum efficiency monotonically grows with the velocity, with an upper limit, whereas the specific impulse initially grows, then reaches a maximum, and finally reduces asymptotically to zero at very large Mach numbers during flight.",29,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34681,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the combustion process and its change with time due to solid-fuel regression in a solid-fuel scramjet combustor. The combustion process is simplified in the sequence changing of three regression shapes. The solid fuel uses hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene with a global one-step reaction mechanism. Numerical simulations based on the shear stress transport model are confirmed by experiments. The simulation data generally agree with the experimental data published in the literature. For simplification, three typical instants during the combustion process, implying three different internal shapes due to fuel regression, are considered. With the sequence of three regression shapes, the fuel diffusion from a solid-fuel surface becomes more extensive and, furthermore, enhances the global combustion efficiency, which is nearly up to 45% at the outlet of the combustor. The simulation results also reveal that the cavity in the combustor provides a fuel enrichment zone and a stable pool of hot reaction products. A thermal choke is caught in the flowfield for the initial geometry, whereas a shock train appears in the main flow and has a tendency to extend with the surface regression. The investigation of the combustion process in this work provides some insight into the design considerations for a combustor with a cavity for a solid-fuel scramjet.",29,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34827,"In this study, the effects of the diameter and quantity of fuel nozzles combined with various cavity-type flame holders for supersonic combustion were investigated empirically and numerically. Although increasing the quantity of fuel nozzles yields a greater fuel-to-air interface area, which results in a higher fuel–air mixing rate, smaller nozzle diameters yield a lower penetration depth, which results in a lower combustion performance at the top wall region. This study adopts the cavity shapes of fuel injectors from previous research studies to design new injector configurations with different sizes and quantities of fuel nozzles. The diameter and quantity of nozzles are determined to have the same equivalence ratio and momentum ratio as were used in previous research under a given fuel pressure. A comparison of results from the present tests with previous research shows that the plain cavity and zigzag cavity have distinct characteristics. Configurations using these cavity types were investigated via three-dimensional numerical analysis. It is concluded that a configuration consisting of a larger number of small fuel nozzles improves combustion performance significantly when installed without a cavity and slightly when installed with a plain cavity. However, combustion performance is degraded when a zigzag cavity is used.",29,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34777,"Compressible isothermal-wall channel flows are studied with direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulation tools. Computations are carried out using a high-order, low-dissipation, bandwidth-optimized weighted essentially nonoscillatory numerical scheme to describe the hyperbolic terms of the Navier–Stokes equations. Periodic supersonic channel flow direct numerical simulation (, , , and ) is used to validate the procedure and the numerical scheme; a new subgrid term contribution based on pressure drop is proposed for the driving term required in momentum and energy equations for large-eddy simulation. Coherent structures of the flowfield are analyzed with scatter plots, criterion, and vorticity fields. As expected, the strong Reynolds analogy is not valid for this nonadiabatic flow. Streaks and horseshoe-like structures are highlighted and detailed. The authors propose a scenario for the formation of horseshoe-like structures. With large-eddy simulation tools, a dynamic procedure to evaluate the turbulent Prandtl number is required because results are found more accurate and computations more stable. Wall temperature and pressure impact are also emphasized on the normalized van Driest velocity profile in the logarithmic region. The classical log law is recovered: with , and a constant depending on and . An analog law is also recovered for the normalized temperature with the maximum of the Prandtl number . An a priori study on mesh requirements determination for a large range of pressure levels is realized through highly near-wall resolved large-eddy simulation.",29,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34750,"Numerical simulations were carried out to determine the sensitivity of results to a variety of geometric and flow parameters commonly employed in high-speed transverse jet-interaction calculations. The configuration consisted of a single circular, flush-wall porthole injector inclined at 30 deg to the freestream in a Mach 4.0 crossflow. Injection was sonic with a jet-to-freestream momentum flux ratio of 2.1. The primary modeling parameters investigated include turbulence model, freestream turbulence intensity, turbulent Schmidt number, and several injector-pipe configurations. The simulations were conducted using the multispecies Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with a number of popular turbulence models including the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras model and the two-equation Menter shear stress transport, two-equation realizable , and two-equation nonlinear (cubic) models. The results were found to be very sensitive to both the choice of turbulence model and value of the turbulent Schmidt number. Sensitivities to the boundary conditions imposed on the injector-pipe walls and injector configuration were noted where injection conditions were held constant, but only small variations in results were found where injection mass flow rate was held constant. Finally, variation of the freestream turbulence intensity was found to have almost no influence on the shear stress transport model; however, small effects were identified for the model.",29,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34782,"A numerical study has been performed to investigate the film-cooling drag reduction performance of a small-scale multiport injector array, in addition to its potential for improved boundary-layer combustion-induced drag reduction. Hydrogen fuel is injected on a flat plate through an array consisting of four streamwise aligned flush circular portholes into a Mach 4.5 crossflow. Parametric studies were conducted on injectant mass flow rate and streamwise jet-to-jet spacing using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with Menter’s Shear Stress Transport turbulence model. Complex jet interactions were found in the injection region with a variety of flow features dependent upon the specific configuration. These flow features were found to have subtle effects on the overall system performance. Total viscous drag reductions of up to 60% over a plate length of 0.5 m were achieved, with local drag reductions of over 90% in the near field. Significant wall heat transfer reductions were also found in all cases. Drag reduction and wall heat transfer rates were strongly influenced by injectant mass flow rate, and only moderately effected by streamwise spacing. The maximum drag reduction performance was found for the highest injectant mass flow rate and closest streamwise jet-to-jet spacing. In contrast, mixing performance generally improved with reduced mass flow rate and increased streamwise spacing.",29,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34506,"A study on vortex injection in hybrid rocket engines with nitrous oxide and paraffin has been performed. The investigation followed two paths: first, the flowfield was simulated with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code; then, burn tests were performed on a laboratory-scale rocket. The computational fluid dynamics analysis had the dual purpose to help the design of the laboratory motor and to understand the physics underlying the vortex flow coupled with the combustion process compared with axial injection. Vortex injection produces a more diffuse flame in the combustion chamber and improves the mixing process of the reactants, both aspects concurring to increase the efficiency. A helical streamline develops downstream of the injection region, and the pitch is highly influenced by combustion, which straightens the flow due to the acceleration in the axial direction imposed by the temperature rise. Experimental tests with similar geometry have been performed. Measured performance shows an increase in regression rate up to 51% and a efficiency that rises from less than 80% with axial injection up to more than 90% with vortex injection. Moreover, a reduction of the instabilities in the chamber pressure has been measured.",29,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34757,"The measurement of the regression rate of a hybrid rocket fuel is the subject matter of this paper. This is an involved problem because both the regression rate and the oxidizer mass flux vary with the port diameter, which itself varies during combustion. This paper addresses the issue of how should be varied to obtain the regression rate correctly. The most commonly used weight loss method has been employed here. Three methods used here to vary the are artificially changing the port diameter, changing the mass flow rate of the oxidizer, and interrupted burn test. From the experiments conducted, it was evident that the interrupted burn test was the best method. These experiments were also carried out for a larger motor and the results compared quite well with established literature. The role of the recirculation zone size near the head end and the overall heat transferred back to the fuel surface in influencing the regression rate have been explained. The role of the recirculation zone diminishes as the length of the rocket motor is increased.",29,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34867,"An experimental performance evaluation of metal hydride fuel additives for hybrid rocket motor propulsion systems is examined in this paper. Some metal hydride additives offer improved performance, but a common issue is material aging. An accelerated aging study revealed that dicyclopentadiene can protect sodium borohydride particles from exposure to air and water vapor much better than conventional hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. Static hybrid rocket motor experiments were conducted using dicyclopentadiene as the fuel. Sodium borohydride and aluminum hydride were examined as fuel additives. Ninety percent rocket-grade hydrogen peroxide was used as the oxidizer. In this paper, the sensitivity of solid fuel regression rate and characteristic velocity efficiency to total fuel grain port mass flux and particle loading is examined. Chamber pressure histories revealed steady motor operation in most tests, with reduced ignition delays when using the fuel additive. The addition of and produces up to a 47 and 85% increase in regression rate over neat dicyclopentadiene, respectively. For all test conditions examined characteristic velocity efficiency ranges between 80 and 90%. The regression rate and characteristic velocity efficiency mass flux dependence indicate a shift toward a more diffusion controlled system with metal hydride particle addition.",29,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34864,"This paper describes the development of a novel catalytic system capable of decomposing hydrogen peroxide. The system is based on ceramic honeycombs in yttria-stabilized zirconia, with manganese oxides as the active phase. The effectiveness of different catalyst preparation procedures, entirely developed in house, has been evaluated using a plug-flow reactor operating with diluted hydrogen peroxide vapors. A monopropellant test bench has been then assembled to verify the performance of a selected number of catalytic samples in a test environment closer to the actual operating conditions of a space propulsion system: the catalysts have demonstrated decomposition efficiencies exceeding 90%. The concept has been finally scaled up to a hybrid configuration based on the utilization of hydrogen peroxide as the oxidizer and high-density polyethylene as the fuel: the possibility to ignite and reignite the fuel grain has been demonstrated and propulsive efficiencies close to 90% have been measured.",29,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34688,"An experimental investigation of a pulsed, quasi-steady, 100-kW-class applied-field magnetoplasmadynamic thruster is discussed. Measurements were obtained with argon propellant for a variety of currents, mass flow rates, and magnetic field strengths in a power range between 20 and 250 kW. Tests were carried out in Alta’s IV-10 vacuum facility. With a volume of about , IV-10 allowed for a current-pulse duration up to 1 s as well as for minimization of the environmental interaction with the plume. Although the shot duration was still too short to achieve steady-state thermal conditions, it allows for direct, time-resolved thrust measurements. To this purpose, a new single-axis thrust stand was designed to improve the frequency response of the existing thrust stands commonly employed in high-power devices. A maximum thrust efficiency of 28% was obtained at about 200 kW for an applied magnetic field of 120 mT and a mass flow rate of . At 100 kW, for the same mass flow rate and magnetic field, a thrust efficiency of 22% and a specific impulse of about 2500 s were achieved. Moreover, during the arc ignition phase, the cathode current attachment was found to be distributed mainly at the external surface of the electrode while a transition from diffuse to hollow cathode behavior was observed after approximately 400 ms from the breakdown.",29,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34712,"This paper presents the results of a two-axis laser-induced fluorescence velocimetry study of singly charged xenon in the interior and near the channel walls of the H6 Hall thruster. The thruster has a nominal operating discharge power of 6 kW and has been operated for before testing. It is operated under seven conditions spanning discharge voltages of 150–600 V and anode mass flow rates of . The mean velocity of the near-wall ion populations varies from 0.5 to with an angle of incidence relative to the wall surface that varies from 30 to 80 deg. In general, the mean velocity and angle of incidence are strongly correlated with the discharge voltage and weakly correlated with the anode mass flow rate. There is strong correlation between the axial locations where high energy (greater than a few tens of electron volts) ions exist and where erosion is discernible in the channel profile. This evidence supports the notion that erosion is negligible below a certain energy threshold. Potential application of this velocimetry technique for qualitative analysis of Hall thruster channel wall lifetime is also discussed.",29,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34799,"Studies of the hollow-cathode discharge have shown the existence of energetic ions at high-discharge currents that are likely responsible for the high erosion rates observed on the cathode keeper electrode. This work examines the effect of neutral gas injection in the discharge plume of a 250 A lanthanum hexaboride hollow cathode on the production of energetic ions to determine the conditions that yield cathode operation and life. Two different gas injector types are used to deliver neutral gas into the discharge plume and a retarding-potential analyzer is used for ion energy measurements. The flow splits between the cathode internal and external flows, and the number and locations of the external gas injection sites are examined as a function of the discharge current. It is found that increasing discharge current increases the energetic ion production at any given flow rate or injection location. External gas injection reduces energetic ion production for constant cathode flow, with collimated gas-jet injection performing better than distributed injection. Lifetime estimates of the keeper electrode surface due to sputter erosion by ion bombardment reveal that high-discharge current operation at low cathode gas flow produced very energetic ions and limited keeper lifetimes to less than 5000 h. Applying sufficient internal cathode gas flow and external gas injection can extend the keeper life to over 10,000 h at discharge currents of up to 200 A.",29,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34790,"The evaluation of an ethanol blended hydrogen peroxide monopropellant thruster was carried out. The specific impulse of hydrogen peroxide was increased by blending it with ethanol. Ethanol was selected because it presented no significant problem in terms of storability. An oxidizer-to-fuel ratio of 50 was selected considering the thermal characteristics of the material used and the higher specific impulse that was obtained in comparison to the theoretical specific impulse of hydrogen peroxide. For the thruster material, 316L stainless steel was chosen based on compatibility test results and other considerations. Barium hexaaluminate was used as a catalyst support because the chamber temperature increased owing to the combustion of ethanol. The surface area of barium hexaaluminate was approximately six times higher than that of alumina after heating at 1200°C. Platinum and manganese oxide with lead oxide catalysts were evaluated on a 10 N class thruster and the catalyst capacity, specific impulse, and efficiency characteristic velocity were almost similar. However, the fluctuation of the chamber pressure increased in the case of manganese oxide with lead oxide catalyst. The decomposition performance of both catalysts showed no remarkable difference, but the platinum catalyst was more reliable.",29,5

The design parameters entering in the definition of the system mass are highlighted, and a careful choice of the figures of merit is performed, in particular for the electric motors and batteries. Indeed, recent developments, taking into account new electric motors based on rare earth permanent magnets (neodymium–iron–boron), and different lithium-based cells, show that the specific mass of the electric-pump system can be reduced to such an extent to make the proposed system competitive not only with the pressure–gas system but also with the turbopump one, at least for some applications such as small launchers and upper stage rockets. Further, electric motor and battery cell technologies currently under development could extend the proposed feed system convenience. Critical points related to electric-pump systems are also discussed.",29,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34721,"One method of significantly improving the performance of gas turbine engines is to use the thermodynamically more efficient unsteady combustion with pressure rise. In this work, the feasibility of using the interaction of shock waves with a flame to achieve pressure-gain combustion is investigated. A new analytical model is described. The pressure rise and entropy suppression of a single shock–flame interaction event is predicted for the first time. The model is quasi-one dimensional, with the shock wave planar and the flame laminar premixed. Given known initial flowfield and flame geometry, as well as the incident shock Mach number, the model allows the calculation of a fully defined one-dimensional flowfield that is formed at the end of a single shock–flame interaction event. The analytical model is successfully verified using experimental data on methane-oxygen-argon flames. It is found that a single shock–flame interaction event temporally generates a dramatic increase in pressure compared to isobaric combustion with the same unburned gas conditions. The associated increase in temperature remains at a relatively moderate level. Further, combustion entropy rise is significantly reduced through a single shock–flame interaction event.",29,5

This work sets out to characterize a thermite mixture to fill this need. Igniter function was determined using high-speed imaging, allowing an examination of product droplet size and combustion time as a function of packaging technique. Safety testing (electrostatic discharge, drop weight impact, and friction) indicated that this material is far safer than existing ignition compounds. A simple dual-criteria ignition model is applied to igniter sizing, and our modeling results were successfully evaluated using hot fire tests of motors with various exposed propellant surface conditions. The end result is a safe, inexpensive, reliable, and readily available method of igniting small (500 g–50 kg propellant mass) solid rocket combustors.",29,5
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34772,"This paper proposes the use of micron-sized aluminum (pyral, average particle size ) with a higher specific surface area as a good candidate to enhance the burn rate of the composite propellant. Experiments were performed in the pressure range of 10 to 70 bar in a window bomb for measuring the burn rate. Comparison of these burn rate results with those obtained using micron- and nanosized aluminum found that the performance of pyral was in between that of micron- and nanosized aluminum. The reason for the high burn rates observed with pyral is due to the flake like appearance of pyral with a large specific surface area. It is argued that, if the specific surface area is large, then the thickness becomes the characteristic length scale. This ensures the heat release from the aluminum combustion to occur closer to the propellant surface as the thickness of pyral is in nanometers. Both the x-ray diffraction and heat of formation analyses indicated that pyral had higher purity than nanoaluminum, which has an implication to the specific impulse of the propellant. In addition to this, it shows that the micron-sized catalyst is effective with pyral, whereas it is ineffective with nanoaluminum. This study also reports the mechanical properties of the propellant containing pyral.",29,5
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34785,"Thermogravimetric measurements were conducted on the oxidation of boron particles to elucidate the influence of particle size and pressure on the reaction process and mechanism. The experimental results showed that the initial temperature increased slightly as the particle size of boron powder increased and increased greatly as the total ambient pressure decreased. The boron oxide covering on the surface of the boron particles had a significant effect on the reactivity of the boron powder. For the particles in the studied size range, the reaction efficiency showed an incremental trend as the particle size increased. High pressure could decrease the reaction efficiency greatly because the evaporation rate of boron oxide would slow down as the ambient pressure increased. Furthermore, it was found that the effect of partial pressure on the reaction efficiency was not only related to the total ambient pressure but also to the mole fraction. Both a higher mole fraction and smaller ambient pressure were favorable for oxidation efficiency. The experimental results also revealed that boron particles with a smaller size or at high pressure had relatively low effective activation energy.",29,5
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34809,"Through careful experimentation, this paper establishes that moisture trapped inside the pores of activated charcoal was the reason for the burn-rate enhancement of composite solid propellant observed in literature. This paper demonstrates that, even with the presence of moisture in activated charcoal, the propellants can not only be cured to be free from blow holes and voids but also have good mechanical properties. Experiments were also carried out to examine the possible mechanism for high burn rates and burn-rate pressure index observed in composite propellants when moisture was present in activated charcoal. Scanning-electron-microscope images show that moisture in activated charcoal reduces the binder melt flow. It is noticed that formation of the bubbly layer is more when moisture is present in the binder. This bubbly layer might be exploding near the surface of the propellant and taking away the binder melt layer. This could be the cause for the observed increase in the burn rate and burn-rate pressure index of aluminized composite propellants.",29,5
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34791,"Ablative materials are commonly used to protect the nozzle metallic housing and to provide the internal contour to expand the exhaust gases in solid rocket motors. Because of the extremely harsh environment in which these materials operate, they are eroded during motor firing with a resulting nominal performance reduction. The objective of the present work is to study the thermochemical erosion behavior of carbon-phenolic material in solid rocket motor nozzles. The adopted approach relies on a validated full Navier–Stokes flow solver coupled with a thermochemical ablation model, which takes into account finite-rate heterogeneous chemical reactions at the nozzle surface, rate of diffusion of the species through the boundary layer, pyrolysis gas and char-oxidation product species injection in the boundary layer, heat conduction inside the nozzle material, and variable multispecies thermophysical properties. The results obtained with the proposed approach are compared with two sets of experimental data: subscale motor tests carried out for the space shuttle reusable solid rocket motor and the static firing tests of the second and third stage solid rocket motors of the European Vega launcher, which use carbon-carbon for the throat insert and carbon-phenolic for the region downstream of the throat.",29,5
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34805,"A new method for kinetic model reduction is proposed. This method consists of two steps: skeletal model reduction using the directed relation graph method, followed by tuning of the remaining rate constants using the solution mapping method. The method can generate reduced models without the need for nonelementary reactions or non-Arrhenius rate constants. The method is demonstrated on a hydrogen–oxygen model and a methane–air model. The results for models at different levels of reduction are compared with the original full models. Results show that the reduced models that underwent optimization are capable of replicating the temperature profile produced by the full model for constant-pressure stream tube reactions, over a limited range of initial conditions, and can now replicate laminar flame speeds at the condition specified by the current optimization. However, perfectly stirred reactor temperatures cannot be accurately predicted. Recommendations are made for further refinement of the technique.",29,5
