1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35021,"Advanced computational models of hypersonic air-breathing combustion processes are being developed to better understand and predict the complex flows within a dual-mode scramjet combustor. However, the accuracy of these models can only be quantified through comparison to experimental databases. Moreover, the quality of computational results is dependent on accurate and detailed knowledge of the combustor inflow and boundary conditions. Toward these ends, this paper describes results from a collaboration of experimental and computational investigators. Detailed computational fluid dynamics and finite element analyses were performed throughout the design and implementation of experiments involving a direct-connect scramjet combustor operating at steady state during long duration testing. The test section hardware was designed to provide substantial access for optical laser diagnostics. Measurement locations included the inflow plane and several locations downstream of fuel injection. A suite of advanced in-stream diagnostics were applied, many of which are described in companion papers. Significant results in this paper include measured static wall pressures and temperatures, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, and focused schlieren imaging. Validated thermal finite element calculations in the scramjet hardware and temperature maps of the flow path boundaries are also presented. Comparison of experimental results with computational fluid dynamics predictions are discussed in a separate paper.",30,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34964,"In this paper, the authors describe dual-pump coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) measurements of mixing and combustion in a direct-connect scramjet combustor operating at equivalent flight Mach typical of the ramjet–scramjet transition, in the scram mode. Measurements were performed in the University of Virginia’s scramjet test facility in which the air is heated by electrical resistance heaters. The CARS technique is used to acquire temporally and spatially resolved measurements of temperature and species mole fraction. Measurements were at four planes: one upstream of an fuel injector and three downstream. Contour plots of mean flow and standard deviation statistics are presented for cases with and without reaction of the fuel. The vibrational temperature at the exit of the facility nozzle, and in the freestream of the scramjet combustor, is elevated compared with the rotational temperature; the air– vibrational temperature is the same as the facility stagnation temperature. There are spatial nonuniformities of temperature exiting the heater. The mixing of the fuel jet from the single ramp wall injector and the growth of the plume downstream is shown. The flame is attached at the injector and propagates from the wall adjacent to the fuel plume, around the periphery of the plume, before engulfing the whole plume. Computational fluid dynamics modeling shows that the flow can be predicted well using hybrid large-eddy simulation/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes methods with relatively simple subgrid models, provided facility effects are properly accounted for.",30,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34905,"The development and use of a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy sensor for combustion product water vapor in a hydrogen-fueled model scramjet combustor are presented. A pair of absorption transitions was selected from the combination bands of water vapor near exploiting telecommunications diode laser and fiber technologies. Wavelength-modulation spectroscopy with detection of the peak second-harmonic signal was used owing to its superior noise-rejection capabilities. The sensor measured temperature and column density at two axial planes downstream of fuel injection with the absorption line-of-sight positioned at over 40 measurement locations using a translation stage system. The combustion product concentration and the gas temperature were not uniform along the line-of-sight, and the influence of these nonuniformities on the interpretation of the tunable diode laser measurements is discussed. The measurements are compared with published computational fluid dynamics simulations using two different kinetic mechanisms.",30,3

A hybrid large-eddy simulation/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes method is used, with special attention focused on capturing facility-specific effects, such as asymmetric inflow temperature distributions, on flow development within the combustor. Predictions obtained using two nine-species hydrogen oxidation models are compared with experimental data obtained using coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy, hydroxyl radical planar laser-induced fluorescence, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, and focusing schlieren techniques. The large-eddy simulation/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models accurately capture the mean structure of the fully developed flame but tend to overpredict fluctuation levels toward the outer edge of the reactive plume. Model predictions worsen in the flame-anchoring region just downstream of the fuel injector. Here, turbulence/chemistry interactions are more pronounced, and the flame is more influenced by the inflow conditions. Comparisons with hydroxyl radical planar laser-induced fluorescence imagery indicate that the large-eddy simulation/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model can capture the effects of larger turbulent scales in deforming the flame structure but does not capture the effects of small turbulent structures in broadening the OH profiles.",30,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34974,"Particle image velocimetry measurements were taken at the center plane of a high-speed cavity combustor in nonreacting and reacting conditions at fuel flows corresponding to medium, medium-high, and high fuel-loading conditions with supersonic core flow velocities. Calculation of the instantaneous and averaged pathlines, vorticity, swirling strength, and divergence of the velocity field revealed a highly unsteady three-dimensional flow with coherent eddy structures formed at the stagnation zone of the shear layer against the downstream ramp of the cavity, which appear to be convected upstream in the cavity. Comparison of the shear layer location, thickness, and impingement stagnation zone revealed a number of changes in the mean and unsteady velocity behavior that were dependent on the heat release in the cavity and shear layer. As combustion shifted from the cavity at medium fuel loading into the shear layer at high fuel loading, the volumetric expansion compressed the primary recirculation zone and thickened the downstream boundary layer at the cavity exit. Combustion in the cavity tended to attenuate cavity and shear layer unsteadiness. When the combustion shifted to the shear layer, velocity unsteadiness increased, though not to the amplitudes measured without combustion.",30,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35016,"Measurements were made in a direct-connect combustor facility designed to simulate cavity flameholding in a hydrocarbon-fueled dual-mode scramjet combustor where the presence of a shock train upstream of the flameholder has a significant impact on the inlet flow to the combustor and on flameholding limits. A mechanical throttle was installed in the downstream end of the test rig to provide the backpressurization needed to form the shock train and to decouple the operation of the flameholder from the backpressure formed by heat release and thermal choking, as it would be in a flight engine. The flameholding limits were measured by ramping inlet air temperature down until blowout was observed. The test facility used a vitiated air heater, Mach 2.2 and 3.3 inlet nozzles, a 0.65–in.-deep cavity, and ethylene and heated JP-7 fuel. A Mean blowout temperature of 1502°R was measured at the baseline condition which used a Mach 2.2 inlet, a cavity pressure of 21 psia, and ethylene fuel. The blowout temperature was found to be most sensitive to fuel injection location and fuel flow rates, and relatively insensitive to inlet Mach number and operating pressure. Video imaging showed unsteady flame structures with significant movements laterally and upstream of the flameholder.",30,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34676,"One of the greatest challenges of hypersonic vehicles is their thermal protection and, more specifically, the cooling of their engine. To simulate the behavior of a complete actively cooled thermal protection system, a computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis coupling method is applied to calculate the fluid/thermal/stress distributions for steady-state flight conditions. Work has been done on four different Ni-based alloys and three different panel structures. Temperature and stress profiles at the outlet cross section show that the maximum temperature and stress happen on the side that is close to the combustion chamber, and so this is the section on which the active cooling system should focus. It is better to have small rounded chamfers in the panels to decrease the stress concentration at the corners. Failure maps are presented for four Ni-based alloys showing the comparison of their thermostructural performance, which will be helpful for the selection of the materials in an active cooling system.",30,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34904,"Experiments are carried out with substitution fluids (air and water), without heat and mass transfer on a rocket engine mockup. The work presented here intends to reproduce the experimental results using incompressible two-phase flow simulations. The geometry used is representative of the experimental mockup composed of a feeding pipe, a dome, and a number of injectors. The objective of the paper is to adapt a Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid model approach to simulate the filling of a dome and to test its ability to reproduce some experimental evidences. The main difficulties to be faced are the fast transients in a complex geometry, including in particular the valve opening sequence, and the drastic evolution of the two-phase flow regime as the flow evolves from gas only to liquid only. An important work has been conducted to obtain the proper inlet conditions to be imposed in the code in coherence with the experiments. The influences of the turbulence modeling and the interfacial momentum transfer modeling are also studied. The former has no macroscopic or local effect on the mass flow rate of water, the mass of water in the dome, and the dome pressure. The drag model, however, has a major impact on the results as much globally as locally. The Simmer-like drag model is preferred in comparison to the Large Interface Model, due to a better agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, it has to be highlighted that the Simmer-like model is very sensitive to the inclusion diameter.",30,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34759,"Previous miniature ion thruster studies have demonstrated impressive performance using ring-cusp discharges. These studies suggest that the magnetic field must be sufficiently strong to increase primary electron confinement times for ionization, but weak enough to allow plasma electrons to escape and maintain the plasma potential necessary for ionization. To investigate these phenomena, an experiment was developed to allow detailed measurements of the internal structure and characteristics of a miniature ring-cusp discharge. These measurements provide spatially resolved values for plasma density, electron temperature, and plasma potential along a meridian plane. The magnetic field configuration is arranged as a quasi-periodic domain in order to generalize the findings to all multipole discharges. The results show that the magnetic field strength drives the plasma structure, and the dependence on discharge power can be removed with proper scaling of the plasma parameters. The stronger magnetic field results in a higher peak plasma density, but relatively low discharge utilization efficiency. In addition, the potential measurements indicate the likely onset of discharge instability. In contrast, the weaker magnetic field, or baseline configuration, better uses the volume of the chamber. This leads to a higher and more uniform density near the downstream end of the discharge where ion extraction would occur, implying superior discharge utilization.",30,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34888,"An active thermal mass flow control system for condensable propellant Hall-effect thrusters was demonstrated. The control system has the ability to arrest thermal runaway in a direct evaporation feed system and stabilize the discharge current during voltage-limited operation of a 2 kW magnesium-fueled Hall-effect thruster. The system supplemented plasma discharge heating at the evaporative anode with a resistive heater located behind the anode. A proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm was implemented to enable automated operation of the mass flow control system using the discharge current as the measured variable and the anode heater current as the controlled parameter. Steady-state operation at constant voltage with discharge current excursions less than 0.35 A was demonstrated for 70 min. A thrust of 44 mN was measured at a discharge voltage of 300 V at 6 A, yielding a thrust-to-power ratio of . A thrust of 50 mN was measured at a discharge voltage of 300 V at 7 A, yielding a thrust-to-power ratio of . For a thruster operating at 2.1 kW, the steady-state supplemental heater power was 136 W, representing only 6% of the total system power.",30,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35018,"Helicon plasma sources are devices that are capable of efficiently producing high-density plasmas. There is growing interest in using a helicon plasma source in space propulsion as a replacement to the direct current plasma discharge in ion engines. A radio frequency ion engine is developed that combines a helicon plasma source with electrostatic grids and a magnetically shielded anode. Thruster performance evaluation includes estimation of the discharge plasma ion density and electron temperature and measurement of the plume current density, grid currents, and thrust. The radio frequency ion engine is tested across the following operating parameter ranges: 343–600 W radio frequency power, 50–250 G magnetic field strength, argon flow rate, and 100–600 V discharge voltage range at an operating pressure of , discharge ion density and electron temperature range and 5.4–9.9 eV, respectively. Maximum beam current extracted is 120 mA at a 600 V discharge and is primarily limited by ion impingement on the grids due to insufficient grid potentials. The maximum measured thrust is 2.77 mN with an average uncertainty of . Further optimization of the thruster operating conditions and grid assembly can improve thruster performance.",30,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34877,Worn Hall-effect thrusters show a variety of unique microstructures and elemental compositions in the boron nitride thruster channel walls. Understanding the plasma conditions that lead to the formation of these microstructures and elemental changes can assist in the goal of creating new ceramic materials with desired plasma material interactions. Pristine and worn Hall-effect thruster channel samples of boron nitride were exposed to xenon plasma in a magnetron sputter device. Erosion rate was shown to depend on the grade of the boron nitride ceramic and the preparation of the surface before plasma exposure. Worn Hall-effect thruster thruster channel samples eroded up to 90% faster than their pristine counterparts. This result highlights the evolution and feedback of the plasma–material interaction within the Hall-effect thruster channel. Microscope images of the ceramic surface show that the magnetron plasma rounded the edges of the ceramic grains to closely match the worn Hall-effect thruster surface. This effect is absent from pure ion beam bombardment and appears to be unique to quasi-neutral plasma exposure.,30,3

This paper describes an experiment that measured the single-stage and two-stage performance of the helicon Hall thruster operating at anode mass flow rates of xenon at 100–200 V discharge voltages, and also for of argon at 300 V, and of nitrogen at 200 V. The helicon Hall thruster performance during operation with argon and nitrogen is characterized by low beam divergence efficiency and low propellant utilization efficiency. During two-stage operation, the thrust of the helicon Hall thruster marginally increased with radio frequency power, but the propulsive efficiency and thrust-to-power both decreased with increasing radio frequency power. Probe diagnostics suggest that gains were realized by a slight increase in propellant efficiency, but that the rate of increase was not sufficient to overcome the increase in power.",30,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34971,"A coupled particle-continuum simulation method is presented to compute the multicomponent mixture plume flow from the attitude-control engines of a satellite through the use of the Navier–Stokes solver and direct simulation Monte Carlo method. In this study, the implicit hybrid flux iteration scheme for the axisymmetric compressible Navier–Stokes equations is constructed to solve the inner flowfield of the nozzle. The Navier–Stokes computing technique is implemented considering slip boundary theory for the near-continuum slip flow near the nozzle exit. Direct simulation Monte Carlo methods for the axisymmetric core plume and three-dimensional far-field plume flows of multispecies mixture gas are developed by using a radial weighted factor, by tracking the molecular motion trajectory, and with secondary Cartesian and unstructured cell processing techniques. A multiregion decomposition and hybrid Navier–Stokes/direct simulation Monte Carlo algorithm with two-way and one-way coupling is established to solve the internal and external flow of the thruster, including the near-field, far-field, backflow, and gas-surface contaminated regions. After constructing the coupled Navier–Stokes/DSMC simulation scheme, the present method is applied to solve the plume flowfield and impinging contamination effects from the satellite attitude-control engine and solar array panel; the simulation results correspond well with the experimental measurements from the low-density wind tunnel and the theoretical predictions. To study the contamination effects produced by the multicomponent mixture plume, the current method is employed to simulate a five-component mixture plume flowfield of tens of meters from two representative attitude-control engines installed in different locations of a satellite in orbit. The results of the nonreacting multicomponent flow with equivalent mole fractions can be achieved with a one-component gas simulation if the species is assigned the properties of the mixture. The deposition rate of the plume flows produced by the two teamwork engines can be superimposed on each other. This method can be used to efficiently predict the impingement contamination effects of the gas-fired mixture plume flow on the satellite and solar array panels.",30,3

The chamber wall showed a range of erosion microstructures. In the heavily eroded regions, striations in the surface topology were evident with surface protrusions in the generic shape of conical tips consisting of stratified BN and silica phases. Microcracking along the long axis of the BN basal plane was prevalent. Through a two-dimensional finite element model, the microcracking has been determined to occur because of the anisotropic thermal expansion of BN in the amorphous silica matrix. Exfoliation accompanied the microcracking in BN and resulted in the preferential loss of BN as compared with silica in these heavily eroded regions.",30,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34768,"Most of the oxidizers available to be used in chemical propulsion applications are highly hazardous materials that are either toxic or explosive in nature. Among the short list of oxidizing agents, liquid oxygen and nitrous oxide stand out as the most practical propellants due to their wide availability, broad base of use, cost effectiveness, and relatively benign nature. A new class of oxidizers (Nytrox) that are composed of equilibrium or nonequilibrium mixtures of nitrous oxide and oxygen are formulated in order to maximize the benefits of the pure components while retaining their practical advantages. Note that in the mixture serves as the pressurizing agent, whereas is the densifying component. The primary advantages of this new system over the pure oxidizers can be listed as 1) self-pressurization capability, 2) high density and density impulse, 3) noncryogenic operational temperatures, 4) higher performance compared with , 4) improved safety, 5) efficient gas-phase combustion, and 6) easier development of stable and efficient motors compared with liquid oxygen due to the exothermic decomposition of the molecule. Unlike the pure oxidizers, the mixture allows for two independent control variables (temperature and pressure), which can be fine tuned to optimize the system for a particular application.",30,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35004,"A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for hypergolic ignition of in a gas mixture has been constructed. In this mechanism, the hypergolic ignition is mainly caused by the sequential reactions of H atom abstraction from by . Although the first step of the H atom abstraction is endothermic, consecutive abstraction reactions for , 2, and 1 are exothermic, and especially heat release by the reaction of is large because of production. Temperature rise caused by the heat release accelerates the endothermic initiation reaction . This thermal feedback is responsible for the hypergolic ignition at low temperatures. Because no experimental and theoretical information is available on these reactions, rate coefficients were evaluated on the basis of transition state theory, unimolecular rate theory, and master equation analysis with quantum chemical calculations of potential energy curves. In addition, reactions of with isomers were also examined. The present kinetic mechanism can explain gas-phase hypergolic ignition of mixtures at temperatures down to 200 K.",30,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35069,"Dynamic interactions between shear coaxial injector flames and periodic compression waves are investigated under controlled density ratio variations. Turbulent diffusion flames are established between an oxygen slot jet in the middle and two hydrogen slot jets on the sides, representing a sectional view of a shear coaxial injector flowfield. Transverse acoustic excitation is applied using a compression driver mounted on one side of the combustor to force possible flame–acoustic interactions. While maintaining a stoichiometric fuel–oxidizer ratio, the density of each stream is controlled by diluting the propellant gases with inert helium and argon by appropriate amounts. Results show strong dependence of flame–acoustic interaction on the density gradient between the propellants. The observed trend is consistent with the vorticity production mechanism created by the baroclinic source term in the flowfield. It is observed that the flames become more resilient to acoustic coupling when the fuel–oxidizer density difference is reduced. The results open up the possibility of using density gradient manipulations to extend the overall stability margin of shear coaxial injector flames.",30,3
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34862,"The accurate simulation of polydisperse sprays strongly coupled to unsteady gaseous flows is a major issue (e.g., for solid rocket motor optimization). The Eulerian multifluid method has proven to account for polydispersity efficiently by describing continuously droplet sizes that are sorted into “fluids,” which are coupled to the gas through drag and heat source terms. The potential of this model to capture polydisperse two-way interactions has not been addressed. Such an interaction is described through two strongly coupled systems of equations, which involve a large spectrum of scales in both time and space and require specific numerical methods to reach accuracy and predictability with an acceptable computational cost. In this paper, we define the physics and key issues of polydisperse spray acoustics, identify physically relevant test cases, and investigate the abilities of multifluid systems. We also describe the numerical peculiarities related to strong coupling, at high mass loading, of polydisperse sprays in unsteady gaseous flowfields. The case of small droplets (i.e., with relaxation timescales that are shorter than the gas flow scales) is carefully studied. We finally introduce, thoroughly study, and adapt to an industrial-oriented code a new numerical strategy with a high level of flexibility, which can be adapted to accuracy needs. The method is tested on an unsteady, polydisperse solid rocket motor to prove its feasibility and efficiency for two-way coupling in a supersonic nozzle, which is representative of the difficulties encountered in a wide range of unsteady flows.",30,3

Various formulations of polymerized-dicyclopentadiene-based composite solid propellant, featuring a solids loading of 85 mass%, were evaluated to observe the effect of varying CF AP ratio and concentration on physical and ballistic properties. Mechanical properties (maximum stress, strain at maximum stress, tangent modulus, and modulus of toughness) were calculated from uniaxial tensile tests of propellant samples. The effect of aging and temperature on mechanical properties were also assessed. End-of-mix viscosities were measured (pre- and postvacuum) to aid improvement of the polymerized-dicyclopentadiene-based propellant manufacturing process. Impact sensitivity of all formulations used in this work was investigated for safety purposes and to validate claims that polymerized-dicyclopentadiene-based composite solid propellants offer a lower hazards classification than their commonplace counterparts.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35054,"The ignition and combustion of boron particles are investigated at high pressures in the range of 1–10 atm. Observation results show that the combustion of amorphous boron particles occurs in two continuous stages. The combustion times of boron particles are measured. The first stage combustion time decreases slightly with an increase of pressure, whereas the second stage combustion time shows strong dependence on pressure. Measured first stage combustion times are compared with the predictions of two typical numerical models, the King model and the Yeh and Kuo model. Both models overpredict the experimental data at higher pressures. The governing equations of the two models have been analyzed to reveal the reasons for the inaccuracy of the predictions. A new model has been developed on the basis of the Yeh and Kuo model, by introducing as the global reaction of B and . The prediction of the new model is in good agreement with experimental results, especially under high-pressure conditions.

The powders 2Al–3CuO and were placed in a sample holder and subjected to an electrostatic discharge from a discharging capacitor. Their optical emission was monitored. Two ignition modes were detected: immediate ignition of individual particles and delayed ignition of a cloud of aerosolized powder. Experiments addressed the effects of material composition and morphology, aging, energy input, layer thickness, and environment on the ignition mode and ignition delays. Prepared thermites were blended with pure metal powders to study ignition of such blends. Individual particle ignition was observed for samples prepared as monolayers in air and argon and for any samples in vacuum. For thicker samples in air and in argon, a delayed powder ignition mode was observed. The delays varied from to several milliseconds. Powders of 2Al–3CuO had shorter ignition delays compared with . For both materials, delays decreased for the powders prepared using longer milling times. For 2Al–3CuO, aged powders ignited after longer delays compared with the freshly prepared powders; however, shorter delays were observed for the aged . Electrostatic discharge energy and layer thickness (except for a monolayer) did not affect the ignition delay. Blending nanocomposite thermites with Al and Ti powders reduced their electrostatic discharge ignition sensitivity and caused longer ignition delays.",30,3
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35072,"The most important parameters influencing the pressure drop over a reacting catalyst bed are analyzed using a multiphase multicomponent flow model. The model, in which the gas and liquid phases are treated as separate fluids, simulates the flow of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide from a tank, through the injector, into the catalyst bed to the nozzle. It contains submodels to describe the interphase mass, momentum, and energy transfer occurring in the catalyst bed, in which it is assumed there is a pellet-based catalyst structure. The main purpose is to investigate the influence of pellet shape and dimensions on the pressure drop over the bed and the required bed length. The model has been verified and validated against experimental data and shows improved predictions of the pressure drop compared with traditionally employed pressure drop models. It is shown that cylindrical pellets with a diameter to length ratio larger than two give a lower pressure drop for a given bed length than spherical pellets. It is furthermore shown that this result is independent of the inlet mass flux and liquid volume fraction distribution and is reliable for high bed to pellet diameter ratios.",30,3

Ethylene was the focus of this study because of its importance in the oxidation of higher-order hydrocarbons. The data exhibited some interesting behavior not typically seen in other lower-order hydrocarbons. For example, the fuel-lean mixtures showed virtually no pressure dependence, whereas at stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions the usual trend of decreasing ignition delay time with increasing pressure was seen. The results are compared with other experimental data available in the literature and to a chemical kinetics model that has been developed over the past few years using primarily high-pressure lower-order hydrocarbon ignition delay times. The original agreement between the model and experiments at the time the data were first obtained was fair at best, stressing the importance of the present data set for improving the understanding of the chemical kinetics of this important hydrocarbon species.

The improved mechanism captures the pressure and equivalence ratio behavior seen in the data at these intermediate temperatures, such as the smaller-than-expected effect of equivalence ratio at the higher temperatures and an apparent lack of pressure dependence at fuel-lean conditions. By using detailed sensitivity analyses, the important reactions were identified, rectifying the model simulations in predicting the observed experimental behavior of the data in this study. In fact, when the model is used to extend the temperature range above 1400 K and below 1000 K, the same pressure dependence is actually seen for all equivalence ratios, just to a lesser extent at the test temperatures. Hence, the resulting hydrocarbon mechanism is much more robust as a result of this exercise.

To generate the shape of the nozzle, the streamline tracing technique is used based on an annular optimum thrust nozzle flowfield calculated using the method of characteristics. The research is conducted using both the computational fluid dynamics approach and wind-tunnel experiments. Viscous flowfields are computed under the design conditions using commercial software Fluent in order to access the aerodynamic performance of the nozzle. The obtained computational fluid dynamics results on flow static pressures on the upper and lower walls of the three-dimensional nozzle have been validated against the measurement data. Comparisons of the computational fluid dynamics and wind-tunnel experimental results have been conducted under two specific nozzle pressure ratios; that is, underexpansion condition with nozzle pressure ratios equal to 70, and overexpansion condition with nozzle pressure ratios equal to 10. It is confirmed that the proposed method is convenient and accurate for designing a three-dimensional circular to rectangular shape transition scramjet nozzle. In comparison with a conventional thrust optimized model, the proposed nozzle designed by streamline tracing technique obtains an increase of thrust by 1.0% and lift by 92.5% under the same conditions. Furthermore, the area ratio of the nozzle designed by this method is 4.2% smaller than that of a thrust optimized one.",30,3

The aim of this study is, even though qualitative to some extent, to establish a method capable of predicting the acoustic characteristics of the high-temperature and high-velocity jets issuing from the realistic hypersonic nozzle having a complicated geometry. Two kinds of test nozzles, 2.4% scaled model with afterburner for hot jet experiments and 1.0% scaled model for cold-air/helium mixture jet experiments, were manufactured and tested. By using a high-enthalpy wind-tunnel plant, acoustic characteristics of the hot jets issuing from the rectangular hypersonic nozzle for several representative but realistic high-temperature and high-velocity jet conditions were obtained. At the same time, by using a small anechoic chamber, the acoustic characteristics of the hot jets were duplicated using cold-air/helium mixture jets having the same velocities. Although we have to pay attention to some noted exceptions, the directivity patterns and the spectral shapes for cold-air/helium mixture jets reasonably agree with those for the hot-air jet and the hot jet with afterburner under lean-burn condition with the error of 2 dB or less.",30,3

The inlet flow of the model diffuser is conditioned to simulate the inlet flow of an airborne blended-wing-body offset diffuser by implementation of a novel boundary layer fence. It is shown that flow distortion at the engine face is reduced by each of the passive and active elements, and the reduction is even more significant when both actuation approaches are implemented, concurrently, over the entire range of test Mach numbers. Hybrid actuation yields an overall distortion reduction of 35% at the design flow condition using a control system that is fail safe and does not require an external air supply.",30,3
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34968,"The suction side boundary-layer evolution in two ultra-high-lift low-pressure turbine blade cascades, characterized by the same Zweifel number but two different aerodynamic loading distributions, has been experimentally analyzed under steady and unsteady incoming flows. For the steady inflow case, a suction side boundary-layer separation has been detected for both cascades. Time-mean velocity and unresolved unsteadiness distributions have been exploited to survey the dynamics of the separated flow transition mode. The spectral analysis reveals that only the midloaded cascade is affected by a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability that induces the separated shear layer rollup, which provokes high losses. Results obtained for the unsteady case reveal that linear stability mechanisms drive the amplification of velocity fluctuations carried by wakes with dynamics similar to that characterizing the steady inflow condition. A rollup vortex has been found to be generated for both cascades as a consequence of the wake–shear-layer interaction process. Different vortex dimensions have been recognized in the two cases, due to the different shear layer thicknesses at separation. The stronger and larger roll-up vortex characterizing the front-loaded cascade allows explaining the higher losses of this cascade, when it operates with unsteady inflow, as compared with the midloaded one.",30,3
