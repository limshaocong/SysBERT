Moreover, although the manufacturing tolerance has substantial effects on the performance of film cooling, the studies on this issue are even scarcer. The present study proposed a robust design optimization procedure that takes the manufacturing uncertainties into account; it was subsequently applied to the film holes on a high-pressure turbine nozzle to obtain a high-performance array shape that is robust to the manufacturing tolerance. To this end, the hole array was parameterized using newly suggested shape functions and two representative manufacturing factors were considered for the film holes. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulation was employed using the kriging surrogate model for a probabilistic design procedure; design optimization was performed using a genetic algorithm. As a result of the optimization, it was possible to obtain a nozzle with superior cooling performance and a robustness maximum 7.66 and 52.53% higher than that of the baseline, respectively. Additionally, it was confirmed that the tolerance of the holes near the leading edge is more influential on the cooling performance than that of the other holes.",33,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36177,"This study examines data from experiments conducted on a liquid-centered swirl coaxial injector under self-pulsation. The element was operated over ranges of water [] and air [] flow. Inner post recess was varied from 0 to 2 mm. Strong self-pulsations in the range of 1000–4000 Hz were observed with and without inner post recess. An analytical survey of potential fluid-dynamic/resonant oscillators is carried out, which includes consideration of swirl post pressure eigenmodes and liquid film hydrodynamics. Measured self-pulsation frequencies are found to correspond well to a family of computed injector responses attributed to liquid surface wave patterns within the swirl injector vortex chamber. This result provides support for the conclusion that the principal fluid oscillator in defining the frequency of self-pulsation for the test article and conditions investigated here is natural surface wave motion within the injector, and it guides the broader notion that self-pulsation is a state that can develop when internal swirl injector hydrodynamics become sensitive to downstream forcing and feedback.",33,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36264,"Cold-flow tests, thermal tests, and numerical simulation were performed to study the thrust-adjustment characteristics, and the thrust-vector-control characteristics, of a fluidic nozzle throat combined with the method of shock vector control. The effective throat-area ratio, thrust-adjustment ratio of the fluidic nozzle throat, and the effect of gas and liquid medium on thrust-vector-control characteristics were investigated. The feasibility of a fluidic nozzle throat being applied to solid rocket motor was verified. Finally, the relationship between the effective throat-area ratio, the thrust-adjustment ratio, and the modified mass-flow-rate ratio has been obtained to provide accessibility for fluidic-nozzle-throat design. The combination of fluidic nozzle throat and shock vector control has been studied with a view to increasing the thrust-control effect. Results show that the effective throat-area ratio, thrust-vector angle, and adjustment ratio are associated with the injection angle, injector placement, and distribution of secondary flow, and increase with the modified mass-flow-rate ratio. By proper placement of secondary-flow injectors, the flow-interface loss can be effectively decreased to retain acceptable thrust-vector-control performance by the combination of fluidic nozzle throat and shock vector control.",33,4

The test campaign consisted of a forward thrust phase and reverse thrust phase at less than vacuum with power scans at 40, 60, and 80 W. The test campaign included a null thrust test effort to identify any mundane sources of impulsive thrust; however, none were identified. Thrust data from forward, reverse, and null suggested that the system was consistently performing with a thrust-to-power ratio of .",33,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36168,"In the present work, the injection of near-critical and supercritical fluid jet into subcritical and supercritical chamber conditions was performed. The main objective of the work was to investigate the transitional nature of the jet. The study was performed using planar-laser-induced-fluorescence technique to obtain the density and density-gradient field of the jet. The compound fluoroketone was used as the injectant fluid, and nitrogen and helium were used as chamber environments due to their difference in the critical-pressure values. The thermodynamic transition of the jet was analyzed using density and density-gradient-field maps. The fractal analysis of the supercritical jet was also performed to investigate the evolution of jet boundary in detail. The results indicated that the thermodynamic transition of the injected supercritical jet to liquid phase under subcritical chamber conditions never occurred in both nitrogen and helium chamber environments; the reason is attributed to the lower injectant density of the supercritical jet. The fractal nature of the jet was also investigated, and the jet boundary possesses fractal dimensions between 1.25 and 1.35, and is in good agreement with those reported elsewhere.",33,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36301,"Variable-area injectors are suitable choices for developing throttleable rocket engines because it is difficult to efficiently control thrust when fixed-area injectors are used. A pintle injector is a variable-area injector that can control the mass flow rate of propellants, thereby replacing a large injector plate having several injector elements with a single injector unit. To achieve proper performance under all throttling conditions, a design procedure was established for a pintle injector based on spray characteristics. The spray angle and Sauter mean diameter of the droplets were critical performance parameters. In spray experiments using water and air as simulants under atmospheric conditions, backlight imaging and laser-diffraction methods were used to measure the spray angle and Sauter mean diameter. The velocity ratio, nondimensionalized opening distance, and Weber number were considered as major nondimensional numbers. Empirical correlations were formulated between performance parameters and nondimensional numbers; these correlations were applied to the design procedure herein. Consequently, a 500 N combustor with a pintle injector was designed using this procedure. A control plan for the pintle-opening distance under lower throttling conditions was also obtained for designing a small combustor. Furthermore, the most sensitive parameters in the injector geometry were confirmed via sensitivity analysis.",33,4

This leads to capabilities such as on-demand throttling and reignition in chemical combustion operation, and it lends itself to application in electric propulsion. In this work, the plasma plume created by electric solid propellant pulsed microthrusters is investigated using a nude Faraday probe, a triple Langmuir probe, and residual gas analysis. The thrusters are tested at a vacuum level of . Results indicate an average plume electron temperature of 1.7 eV and a density of to . A time-of-flight analysis indicates an exhaust velocity of on the centerline. Additionally, ionization fraction is estimated to be 0.3% for an ablation mass bit of on average. Thermal equilibrium and adiabatic expansion calculations suggest a nonequilibrium gas with high-temperature electrons and lower-temperature neutral and ion species. Results indicate the pulsed microthruster operates similar to a coaxial pulsed plasma thruster, which is dominated by electrothermal effects.",33,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36278,"Rare event simulation is vital for industrial design because some events, so-called black swans, can have fatal consequences despite their low probability of occurrence. Finding low-probability events far off the mean design is a challenging task for realistic engineering models because they are characterized by high computational demands, many input variables, and often insufficient statistical information to build parametric probability distributions. Therefore, an adaptive and arbitrary polynomial chaos method, called sparse approximation of moment-based arbitrary polynomial chaos, is suggested in this work. Sparse approximation of moment-based arbitrary polynomial chaos creates custom polynomial basis functions and grids based on statistical moments to avoid incorrect statistical assumptions. The contribution of this work is that it is derived how rare event simulation can conveniently be integrated into adaptive sparse grid methods by calculating polynomial chaos expansions based on the statistical moments of truncated fat-tailed distributions. Moreover, the use of tempered alpha-stable distributions is suggested to avoid discontinuous tail cutoffs. Sparse approximation of moment-based arbitrary polynomial chaos is compared to other statistical methods in two industrial aircraft engine simulations: a simulation of transient cycle temperature in a turbine cavity and hot-gas ingestion in the interwheel region. In both cases, sparse approximation of moment-based arbitrary polynomial chaos agrees with previous results but obtains them with lower computational effort.",33,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36239,"Burning tests were carried out for the 5-kN-thrust swirling-oxidizer-flow-type hybrid rocket engine to establish the engine technology and to obtain the fuel regression characteristics. The engine attained stable burning without any combustion oscillation and efficiencies of more than 98% under the 5-kN-thrust conditions. The maximum time-averaged thrust realized was 4.4 kN, which was lower than 5 kN. This was attributed to the regression rate being lower than the value estimated by regression rate correlation. The fuel regression behavior of this engine was characterized as the flow-development region near the grain leading edge and the fully developed turbulent flow region. The axial length of the flow-development region varied from that observed in the laboratory-scale engine, and it depended on the oxidizer mass flow rate, grain initial port diameter, and swirl strength. The controlling parameter of the regression rate in the fully developed flow region was modified to correlate with the grain port diameter. By effecting these modifications, the accuracy of the regression rate prediction was improved. The range of the applicable controlling parameter of the modified regression rate correlations was extended for use for larger-scale engines.",33,4

By using shock tube experiments, this paper compares three ignition criteria, namely, , visible light, and pressure under high and low diluent conditions, respectively. Main comparison principles include signal-to-noise ratio, readability of signal curves, and model validation. Different types of and visible light response curves are displayed. Experimental results indicate that is the most appropriate ignition criterion under high diluent conditions. Visible light is the second most suitable choice, whereas pressure is unsuitable as the ignition criterion. Under low diluent conditions relevantly, , visible light, and pressure can all be used as the ignition criteria. Moreover, visible light signals generally occur later than , and the visible-light reading results are correspondingly larger, whereas an overlarge gain factor can result in smaller visible-light reading results than those of . In summary, the optimum sequence of three ignition criteria decreases in the order of under different diluent conditions.",33,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36251,"End-wall boundary layers and induced blockages are important factors for multistage axial compressors’ performance. This paper investigates hub and shroud end-wall boundary layers, and the corresponding blockages of a five-stage axial compressor under different conditions. The results show that the hub displacement thickness increases from the front to rear stage, whereas the shroud displacement thickness remains almost the same. At the design point, the blockage increases from 2.4% for the front stage to 14.7% for the rear stage, which is dominated by the hub displacement thickness. Under different operating conditions of 100% speed, the blockage is almost the same for the front stage, but increases significantly for the rear stage from 6.0% at near choke to 22.2% at near surge. At peak-efficiency points of different rotational speeds, the blockage remains almost the same. The steady and unsteady results show almost the same trends of displacement thickness and blockage. Compared to unsteady simulations, the time consumption of steady simulations is only one-sixtieth, which can save large amounts of computational resources. Based on the results, the trends of displacement thicknesses and blockages are almost the same in a wide range of operating conditions, which indicates that the flow control in the end-wall region for the design condition would be still effective.",33,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36138,"Modern low-emission combustor concepts, such as lean combustion, pose challenges to turbine designers, among them a flatter temperature profile with increased thermal load to the endwalls and a three-dimensional inflow. The complexity of the flowfield make numerical investigations and rules for turbine thermal design under swirling inflow a delicate task. An experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate a film-cooling design for a stator endwall in respect to its robustness to swirling combustor inflow and its limitations. The experiments were conducted at the Large Scale Turbine Rig at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, operating at low-Mach-number, cold-flow conditions. A swirler module is used to generate an engine-realistic whirl-angle distribution with averaged values of 14 deg in the upper main annulus and 11 deg in the lower annulus. Spatially resolved Nusselt numbers and film-cooling effectiveness data are acquired by infrared thermography with the auxiliary wall method for swirling inflow. The comparison to the axial inflow baseline case highlights the robustness of the design. Swirling inflow increases Nusselt numbers until at 2.9% injection the level remains similar to the baseline, whereas film-cooling effectiveness is reduced by 30%.",33,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36305,"Supersonic combustion experiments were conducted to determine the effect of a mixing enhancement fin on the combustion operation and reaction zone characteristics of a dual-mode scramjet. This fin-guided fuel injection approach was compared against a baseline that used no fin. A direct-connect vitiated-air facility was used to simulate the total enthalpy of a Mach 4.4 flight condition and generate a Mach 1.9 flow at the isolator inlet. Laboratory-scale tests were performed in a model combustor designed with a cavity flame holder and a 2 deg expansion. The experiments used hydrogen fuel at an overall equivalence ratio ranging between 0.05 and 0.25. The combustor flowfield was qualitatively analyzed using schlieren and chemiluminescence imaging, whereas quantitative assessments were made by comparing wall pressure distributions and exit temperature measurements. Low jet penetration with the baseline supplied the cavity with ample fuel, which concentrated the heat release and thermally choked the flow for an equivalence ratio higher than 0.10. Increased jet penetration with fin-guided injection displaced the reaction downstream of the cavity, enabling supersonic combustion up to an equivalence ratio of 0.15 but generating a flame 81–182% longer compared to the baseline. Practical considerations of using fin-guided fuel injection in a real system are discussed.",33,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36182,"A multiphysics radio-frequency gridded-ion thruster performance model is presented. The model is composed of various submodels to account for different physics phenomena. A two-dimensional axisymmetric ion extraction submodel is used to estimate the ion optics effective transparency and beam divergence. A two-dimensional axisymmetric and three-dimensional molecular neutral gas submodels are used to calculate the ion optics Clausing factor and the discharge chamber pressure, respectively. An electron transport submodel determines the rate coefficients and the effective collision frequency by solving a two-term approximation Boltzmann equation. The plasma properties are calculated by employing a volume-averaged zero-dimensional plasma submodel. A fully three-dimensional thruster geometry is used for determining electromagnetic thruster and plasma parameters, such as the coupling coefficient, power losses, and field distributions. The submodel solves Maxwell’s equations in the thruster and plasma represented by a complex conductivity. To improve on the uniform plasma assumption, a radial variation in plasma density/conductivity is introduced. The impedance matching and circuit power losses are accounted for by a radio-frequency circuit submodel, in which the thruster is represented by a complex impedance obtained from the electromagnetic submodel. It is shown that the model predicts the Radio-Frequency Ion Thruster 3.5 experimentally measured radio-frequency generator power and current data values (and trends) within 13% error bound for various operational conditions.",33,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36232,"The boundary layer on the end wall of a turbine blade cascade is subject to cross-stream pressure gradients in the blade passage, which generate a cross-stream velocity component to make it three dimensional. This distorts the turbulence relative to a two-dimensional boundary layer and impacts the end wall heat transfer. This study presents measurements of the three-dimensional boundary layer in a turbine cascade obtained with a laser Doppler velocimeter. In addition, two types of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models are compared to the measurements: the Shear Stress Transport model using the isotropic eddy viscosity assumption and a Reynolds stress model that allows for anisotropy of the Reynolds stress. Neither model fully captures the complexity of the three-dimensional boundary layer in a turbine blade passage, particularly for turbulence associated with the cross-stream flow and for the highly accelerated three-dimensional boundary layer at the passage exit. Measurements at the passage exit indicate a very thin boundary layer with laminarlike qualities. Because of the boundary-layer complexity, end wall heat transfer is not well predicted toward the pressure side and the exit of the blade passage.",33,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36275,"An experimental investigation was performed to examine the effects of flow compressibility and density ratio of coolant to mainstream flows on the performance of film cooling injected from a row of cylindrical holes over a flat plate. The experimental study was conducted in a transonic wind tunnel. A pressure-sensitive paint technique was used to map the corresponding adiabatic film cooling effectiveness distributions over the surface of interest, based on a mass flux analog to traditional temperature-based cooling effectiveness measurements. It was found that, at the relatively low blowing ratio of , the flow compressibility had almost no effects on the film cooling effectiveness over the surface of interest. At relatively high blowing ratios of , the film cooling effectiveness for the test case with compressible, transonic mainstream flow was found to become marginally better than that with the mainstream being incompressible. Although the density ratio was found to have limited effects on the film cooling performance at relatively low blowing ratios, it was found to affect the film cooling effectiveness substantially at relatively high blowing ratios. A denser coolant flow would result in a better film cooling protection to the surface of interest.",33,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36230,"The successful application of a fully shielding magnetic field topology in a low-power Hall thruster is demonstrated through the testing of the MaSMi-60 Hall thruster (an improved variant of the original Magnetically Shielded Miniature Hall thruster). The device was operated at discharge powers from 160 to 750 W at discharge voltages ranging from 200 to 400 V. Several techniques were used to determine the effectiveness of magnetic shielding achieved by the MaSMi-60 and to estimate the reduction in discharge channel erosion rate enabled by the shielding field topology. This ultimately suggested an improvement in discharge channel life by a factor of at least 10 times, and likely greater than 100 times, when compared to unshielded devices. Thruster performance, measured both directly by a thrust stand and indirectly by plume diagnostics, was lower than expected when compared to results from high-power magnetically shielded Hall thrusters. However, the plume diagnostic measurements enabled the identification of the primary causes for the MaSMi-60’s moderate performance.",33,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36268,"Electrospray thrusters can deliver the efficient primary propulsion and attitude control actuation needed by small satellites. The microfabricated multiemitter array is an ideal implementation of this technology because it addresses the thrust, volume, mass, and scalability requirements across the size range of small satellites. This paper describes the microfabrication and testing of an internally fed 64-emitter array. The main goal is to decouple the design and fabrication of the emitters from the need to provide a flowpath with sufficient hydraulic resistance for each emitter. The latter has traditionally been achieved by reducing the diameter of the emitter’s inner channel or by filling it with a bed of beads; whereas in this paper, individual flow-restrictive channels are etched on the back of the emitter wafer, connecting each emitter to a common distribution manifold. The source operates steadily in vacuum. Beam interception by the extractor is negligible in a wide range of flow rates and emitter potentials. The thrust, mass flow rate, specific impulse, and propulsive efficiency are calculated using the time-of-flight technique. These parameters range between 8.1 and , and , 96 and 236 s, and 61 and 75% using the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide as propellant.",33,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36231,"The applicability of a fully shielding magnetic field topology to a low-power xenon Hall thruster was demonstrated through testing of the MaSMi-60. Although the discharge channel lifetime was significantly increased, performance testing of the device revealed a peak anode efficiency of under 30%, which was lower than expected given the available data on high-power magnetically shielded Hall thrusters. Experimental measurements in a vacuum facility with operating pressures of suggest that the MaSMi-60’s current utilization, mass utilization, and beam divergence efficiencies were the key contributors to its moderate performance. To better understand the physics causing these performance deficiencies, a computational analysis including 2D plasma modeling of the MaSMi-60 was conducted. Results from the 2D numerical models confirmed that the MaSMi-60 achieved the parameters necessary for magnetic shielding. The physics governing the low mass utilization, current utilization, and beam divergence efficiencies were then identified and described using the computational model results. The low mass utilization is attributed to a long ionization mean free path in the discharge channel caused by the predominantly axial trajectory of the injected propellant. Insufficient magnetic field strength enabling excessive electron current to the anode was the primary cause for the poor current utilization. Lastly, the high beam divergence was due to an overly shielding magnetic field topology that promoted high-energy ions to be accelerated far off the thruster’s axis.",33,4
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36332,"The paper investigates thruster nozzle shapes for use in annular multichamber aerospike engine configurations. A thruster shape with a supersonic nozzle section curved in the circumferential and longitudinal directions is presented and compared to a classical linear thruster configuration. The multithruster aerospike engine flowfield along a typical ascent trajectory including slipstream effects is investigated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes with a realizable turbulence model. Longitudinal curvature leads to a radial pressure stratification of the thruster exit flow (caused by internal expansion and compression waves), with a decrease in pressure at the plug nozzle and an increase at the outer thruster lip. Circumferential curvature leads to a more homogeneous flow in the lateral direction, reducing pressure peaks at thruster intersections. For a fixed overall engine diameter, the larger engine nozzle area achieved with dual curved thrusters leads to performance improvements of about 2% when compared with the linear design. Improvements result from increased thruster performance at higher pressure ratios and a larger contribution of the plug, which has a larger area. In addition, engines with curved thrusters use a greater portion of the launcher’s cross section and thus reduce base drag.",33,4
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36064,"The present experimental investigation explores utilization of active flow control for mitigation of the flow separation over a shortened turning section of a cascade thrust reverser, also known as a bullnose. Such a reduction in the nominal thrust reverser length, with minimal or no penalty in increased drag and reduced reversed thrust, would reduce both the wetted area and weight of the nacelle. To minimize the performance penalty, the shortened thrust reverser sector model is equipped with an array of small-scale fluidic oscillating jets that are used as the flow control elements for the oncoming Mach numbers of . The flow control effectiveness is demonstrated over four bullnose geometries, down to 47% of the nominal bullnose length. The established scaling laws indicate that the mass flow rate recovery is directly proportional to the actuation flow rate for a given flow configuration and condition, and it is strongly nonlinear with the flow pressure ratio for a given flow control rate. Furthermore, it is shown that, in terms of the dimensionless flow control parameter , low- and high-curvature bullnose geometries exhibit different trends in the thrust reverser mass flow rate recovery.",33,4
