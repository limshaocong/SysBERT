1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35564,"The accurate, direct measurement of thrust or impulse is one of the most critical elements of electric thruster characterization, and it is one of the most difficult measurements to make. This paper summarizes recommended practices for the design, calibration, and operation of pendulum thrust stands, which are widely recognized as the best approach for measuring micronewton- to millinewton-level thrust and micronewton-per-second-level impulse bits. The fundamentals of pendulum thrust stand operation are reviewed, along with the implementation of hanging pendulum, inverted pendulum, and torsional balance configurations. The methods of calibration and recommendations for calibration processes are presented. Sources of error are identified, and methods for data processing and uncertainty analysis are discussed. This review is intended to be the first step toward a recommended practices document to help the community produce high-quality thrust measurements.",33,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35644,"Accurate control and measurement of propellant flow to a thruster is one of the most basic and fundamental requirements for operation of electric propulsion systems, whether they be in the laboratory or on flight spacecraft. Hence, it is important for the electric propulsion community to have a common understanding of typical methods for flow control and measurement. This paper addresses the topic of propellant flow primarily for the gaseous propellant systems that have dominated laboratory research and flight application over the last few decades, although other types of systems are also briefly discussed. Although most flight systems have employed a type of pressure-fed flow restrictor for flow control, both thermal-based and pressure-based mass flow controllers are routinely used in laboratories. Fundamentals and theory of operation of these types of controllers are presented, along with sources of uncertainty associated with their use. Methods of calibration and recommendations for calibration processes are presented. Finally, details of uncertainty calculations are presented for some common calibration methods and for the linear fits to calibration data that are commonly used.",33,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35531,"Presented in this work is a guide to standardize the methods of performing correct and accurate Langmuir probe measurements within the plasma environment produced by an electric propulsion device. The construction, installation, operation, and data interpretation of the full family of Langmuir probes are addressed including single Langmuir probes, double Langmuir probes, and triple Langmuir probes. Traditional time-averaged operation as well as high-speed operation are discussed as are the various pressure and external field limitations of Langmuir probes. This recommended practice is established from the vast collection of preexisting Langmuir probe theory and operational experience within the plasma environment of electric propulsion thrusters. Focus is placed on the application of Langmuir probes in the most common electric propulsion devices including Hall, ion, and pulsed thrusters. These electric propulsion devices all create flowing plasmas that require special probe construction and data analysis that is not needed in many other types of plasmas where Langmuir probes are commonly employed. The recommended practices are presented in a concise handbook style, reserving all theoretical derivations and details to the referenced works of their origination.",33,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35696,"Faraday probes are a common plasma diagnostic used to determine the local ion charge flux of electric propulsion plumes. Standard practices, guidelines, and recommendations are provided for experimental methods and analysis techniques that aim to standardize community practices, to mitigate test environment effects, and to reduce systematic measurement error in order to improve plume predictions in the space environment. The approaches are applicable to time-averaged plasma properties in the near-field and far-field of electric propulsion plumes, with emphasis on Hall effect thrusters and gridded ion thrusters. Considerations for other electric propulsion technologies are provided, including electrosprays, arcjets, and electromagnetic thruster concepts. These test strategies are expected to increase the quality of comparisons between different thrusters and vacuum environments, thereby broadening the applicability of ground-based measurements and enhancing the fidelity for on-orbit predictions and modeling validation.",33,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35697,"This article provides recommended methods for building, operating, and taking plasma potential measurements from electron-emitting probes in electric propulsion devices, including Hall thrusters, gridded ion engines, and others. The two major techniques, the floating point technique and the inflection point technique, are described in detail as well as calibration and error-reduction methods. The major heating methods are described as well as the various considerations for emissive probe construction. Special considerations for electric propulsion plasmas are addressed, including high-energy densities, ion flows, magnetic fields, and potential fluctuations. Recommendations for probe design and operation are provided.",33,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35413,"Electrostatic analyzers are used in electric propulsion to measure the energy per unit charge distribution of ion and electron beams: in the downstream region of thrusters, for example. This paper serves to give an overview of the most fundamental, yet most widely used, types of electrostatic analyzer designs. Analyzers are grouped into two classifications: 1) mirror-type analyzers, and 2) deflector-type analyzers. Common mirror-type analyzers are the parallel-plate mirror analyzer and the cylindrical mirror analyzer. For deflector-type analyzers, a generalized toroidal type is first described and the commonly used cylindrical deflector and spherical deflector analyzers are discussed as special cases. The procedure for energy resolution calculations of electrostatic analyzers is described, which is a common way of comparing analyzers. Ion energy distributions from a spherical deflector analyzer are presented, comparing variations in 1) particle energy, 2) particle angle, 3) the entrance and exit geometry of the analyzer, and 4) sector angle using numerical calculations.",33,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35406,"Inductive magnetic field probes (also known as -dot probes and sometimes as probes or magnetic probes) are often employed to perform field measurements in electric propulsion applications where there are time-varying fields. Magnetic field probes provide the means to measure these magnetic fields and can even be used to measure the plasma current density indirectly through the application of Ampère’s law. Measurements of this type can yield either global information related to a thruster and its performance or detailed local data related to the specific physical processes occurring in the plasma. The available literature is condensed into an accessible set of rules, guidelines, and techniques to standardize the performance and presentation of future -dot probe measurements.",33,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35478,"The electric propulsion community has been implored to establish and implement a set of universally applicable test standards during the research, development, and qualification of electric propulsion systems. Variability between facility-to-facility and more importantly ground-to-flight performance can result in large margins in application or aversion to mission infusion. Performance measurements and life testing under appropriate conditions can be costly and lengthy. Measurement practices must be consistent, accurate, and repeatable. Additionally, the measurements must be universally transportable across facilities throughout the development, qualification, spacecraft integration, and on-orbit performance. A recommended practice for making pressure measurements, pressure diagnostics, and calculating effective pumping speeds with justification is presented.",33,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35958,"Ion thruster plumes are simulated under a recently developed computer framework inside a vacuum chamber at various background pressures for single- and triple-thruster configurations. Momentum and charge–exchange collisions occurring between neutral and ion species, as well as the induced electric field due to ions, are performed using multiple adaptive mesh refinement meshes to study the spatial variance of neutrals and ions while analyzing the effect of vacuum chamber conditions. Comparisons between vacuum chamber and space simulations show that the spatial distribution of the neutral densities are different in the far downstream region of the ion thruster. The change in the background density is also found to affect the spatial distributions of the charge–exchange ions in the domain. The triple-thruster cases show that the background density levels are approximately proportional to the number of thrusters being operated. The adaptive mesh refinement capability is shown to be able to capture the confinement effect of the flow in the vacuum chamber.",33,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35936,"Research into hot corrosion and its preventative measures in gas turbine engines has focused almost exclusively on sodium sulfate since the early 1950s. However, current gas turbine engines on U.S. Department of Defense aircraft are exhibiting degradation due to hot corrosion following operations in locations where sodium sulfate is not present. In light of this, questions raised by previous hot corrosion research are reviewed with regard to U.S. Department of Defense operations. Initial lab results suggest calcium sulfate as a likely alternative initiator of hot corrosion in environments, or at temperatures, where sodium-sulfate-initiated hot corrosion is not probable.",33,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35741,"The tabulated premixed conditional moment closure model has shown the capability to model turbulent, premixed methane flames with detailed chemistry and reasonable run times in a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes formulation. The tabulated premixed conditional moment closure model is a table lookup combustion model that tabulates species, reaction rates, and thermodynamic data for use by the computational-fluid-dynamics code during run time. In this work, the tabulated premixed conditional moment closure model is extended to unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes. The new model is validated against particle image velocimetry and laser Raman measurements of an enclosed turbulent reacting methane jet from the German Aerospace Center. The flame’s reaction progress variable, its variance, and the scalar dissipation rate are calculated by the computational fluid dynamics in three dimensions. These three parameters are used to index detailed species information from the table for use by the computational-fluid-dynamics code. The scalar dissipation is used to account for the effects of the small-scale mixing, whereas a presumed shape beta function probability density function is used to account for the effects of large-scale turbulence on the reaction rates. Velocity, temperature, and major species are compared to the experimental data. Accurate predictions of the velocity fields were obtained, but accurate predictions of scalar quantities were limited by the adiabatic assumption of the tabulated premixed conditional moment closure model.",33,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36016,"Combustion stability characteristics of a turbulent diffusion flame established between a center jet of gaseous oxygen and coflowing jets of gaseous hydrogen blended with different amounts of gaseous methane are studied in a rectangular combustor operating under atmospheric pressure conditions. A compression driver, mounted near the injector, is used to acoustically excite the flame from a transverse direction. Resulting flame perturbations are studied using chemiluminescence imaging, dynamic pressure measurements, and high-speed flow visualizations. Both steady-state perturbations and perturbations as the acoustically forced flames transition from one fuel blend to another are studied. Simultaneous measurements of pressure oscillations and heat release oscillations are used to obtain local Rayleigh indices showing locations that drive or dampen the instability. Transient measurements associated with real-time in situ methane blending are used to obtain timescales associated with the suppression process. Interesting intermittencies in heat release oscillations driven by acoustic forcing and local hydrodynamics are explored. Heat release oscillations, which drive combustion instability, are substantially reduced when gaseous methane is blended with gaseous hydrogen while holding ignition characteristics relatively constant. The reduction appears to result from a lowering of the density difference between the propellant streams upon methane dilution fuel–oxidizer density ratio. The approach could potentially be used in shear-coaxial combustors where instability from similar flame–acoustic interactions are common.",33,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36267,"Effective fault detection and identification methods are crucial in gas turbine maintenance. To express the gas turbine performance of the fault symptom state precisely and to reduce the individual differences of different gas turbines, a novel performance deviation model based on real-life operation data of gas turbines is proposed in this paper. A backpropagation neural network is adopted to establish the performance deviation model. Performance deviation values calculated by the model are regarded as fault signatures of the gas turbines. To enhance the accuracy of the fault diagnosis, a multikernel support vector machine is employed in the fault classification experiment. A contrast experiment showed the accuracy of the fault diagnosis method based on the performance deviation model and multikernel support vector machine.",33,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36081,"This paper quantifies the changes in turbine performance due to manufacturing tolerances and profile degradation of the blade-tip region during engine operation. An extensive numerical study was conducted on a modern high-pressure turbine rotor, operating at high Reynolds and high subsonic outlet conditions. The stochastic collocation method was used to investigate the effects of the geometrical variability of a single squealer tip design. The variation of three geometrical characteristics was investigated: tip clearance size, squealer depth, and rim corner radius. Three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations were performed to predict the aerodynamic and heat transfer characteristics. The results highlight the influence of the combined geometrical variability on the overtip flow structures, heat transfer signatures, loss development, and downstream flow characteristics. This study measures the robustness of squealer tip designs to changes in its geometry and demonstrates the necessity of anticipating the consequences of these unavoidable tip geometry variabilities in an early development stage of the turbine design optimization.",33,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36308,"Dilution jets in a gas turbine combustor are used to oxidize remaining fuel from the main flame zone in the combustor and to homogenize the temperature field upstream of the turbine section through highly turbulent mixing. The high-momentum injection generates high levels of turbulence and very effective turbulent mixing. However, mean flow distortions and large-scale turbulence can persist into the turbine section. In this study, a dilution hole configuration was scaled from a rich-burn–quench–lean-burn combustor and used in conjunction with a linear vane cascade in a large-scale, low-speed wind tunnel. Mean and turbulent flowfield data were obtained at the vane leading edge with the use of high-speed particle image velocimetry to help quantify the effect of the dilution jets in the turbine section. The dilution hole pattern was shifted (clocked) for two positions such that a large dilution jet was located directly upstream of a vane or in between vanes. Time-averaged results show that the large dilution jets have a significant impact on the magnitude and orientation of the flow entering the turbine. Turbulence levels of 40% or greater were observed approaching the vane leading edge, with integral length scales of approximately 40% of the dilution jet diameter. Incidence angle and turbulence level were dependent on the position of the dilution jets relative to the vane.",33,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36223,"High-amplitude combustion instabilities are a destructive and pervasive problem in gas-turbine combustors. Although much research has focused on measuring the characteristics of these instabilities, there are still many remaining questions about the fluid-mechanic mechanisms that drive the flame oscillations. In particular, a variety of complex disturbance mechanisms arise during velocity-coupled instabilities excited by transverse acoustic modes. The resulting disturbance field has two components: the acoustic-velocity fluctuation from both the incident transverse acoustic field and the excited longitudinal field near the nozzle, and the vortical-velocity fluctuations arising from acoustic excitation of hydrodynamic instabilities in the flow. In this research, the relative contribution of these two components had been explored using proper orthogonal decomposition as a methodology for decomposing the velocity-disturbance field. Although proper orthogonal decomposition is successful at decomposing these two components at certain nonreacting conditions, it fails at reacting conditions. These results show the significant interaction of velocity-disturbance modes under reacting conditions and the limitations of the proper-orthogonal-decomposition technique for extracting velocity-decomposition information.",33,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36226,"The performance of different constraints for the rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium (RCCE) method is investigated in the context of modeling reacting flows characteristic of hypervelocity ground testing facilities and reentry conditions. Although the RCCE approach has been used widely in the past, its application in non-combustion-based reacting flows is rarely done; the flows being investigated in this work do not contain species that can easily be classified as reactants and/or products. The effectiveness of different constraints is investigated before running a full computational simulation, and new constraints not reported in the existing literature are introduced. A constraint based on the enthalpy of formation is shown to work well for the two gas models used for flows that involve both shocks and steady expansions.",33,3
