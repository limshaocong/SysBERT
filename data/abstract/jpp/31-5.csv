0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35562,"Until recently, modern theory has lacked a fundamentally based model to predict the operating pressures where classical sprays transition to dense-fluid mixing with diminished surface tension. In this paper, such a model is presented to quantify this transition for liquid-oxygen–hydrogen and n-decane–gaseous-oxygen injection processes. The analysis reveals that respective molecular interfaces break down not necessarily because of vanishing surface tension forces but instead because of the combination of broadened interfaces and a reduction in mean free molecular path. When this occurs, the interfacial structure itself enters the continuum regime, where transport processes rather than intermolecular forces dominate. Using this model, regime diagrams for the respective systems are constructed that show the range of operating pressures and temperatures where this transition occurs. The analysis also reveals the conditions where classical spray dynamics persists even at high supercritical pressures. It demonstrates that, depending on the composition and temperature of the injected fluids, the injection process can exhibit either classical spray atomization, dense-fluid diffusion-dominated mixing, or supercritical mixing phenomena at chamber pressures encountered in state-of-the-art liquid rocket engines.",31,5

The focus of this study is to analyze different modes of sheets experimentally in an advanced hybrid injector, which uses both pressure swirl and air momentum to impart instability into the sheet. Apart from measurement of certain macroscopic spray physical parameters like breakup length and sheet width, the images for different sheet profiles were processed to obtain fractal dimensions, temporal frequency, and different orthogonal modes using proper orthogonal decomposition. A moderate airflow is seen to create a stable liquid sheet with increased breakup length, whereas higher airflows at low liquid flows create an air-blast type of spray with disintegration very close to the nozzle. The latter shows dominance of multiple smaller temporal frequencies with relatively lower power spectral densities. A spray with high liquid flow and relatively low airflows shows a longer and wider sheet with a single dominant frequency.",31,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35740,"A numerical investigation of supersonic combustion for ethylene and air coflow with a splitter plate is presented, mimicking the flame stabilization and combustion establishment in a dual-combustion ramjet engine. Emphasis is placed on the detailed flow and flame characteristics immediately downstream of the splitter plate and in the shock-wave/shear-layer interaction regions. Three different splitter-plate thicknesses, 2, 4, and 8 mm, are considered, to identify the significance of the geometric parameters. The analysis is based on the Favre-averaged conservation equations for compressible chemically reacting flows. Turbulence closure is achieved using Menter’s shear-stress transport model with a detached-eddy-simulation extension. Chemical reactions are modeled using a nine-species, ten-step laminar chemistry model with sufficient numerical resolution. Various mechanisms dictating the flame anchoring and spreading properties are examined. The hot stream from the ethylene preoxidization in the gas generator is found to behave like an underexpanded supersonic jet. Its subsequent expansion in the present wall-confined environment has a strong influence on the near-field mixing and combustion. Depending on the splitter-plate thickness, the wake region behind the splitter plate changes in size, and the autoignited flame can be either attached to or detached from the rim. The majority of chemical reactions take place in the mixing layer farther downstream, and the combustion efficiency varies in accordance with the near-field phenomena.",31,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35335,"A key issue that can affect the implementation of boundary-layer combustion for viscous drag reduction in scramjet combustors is the potential of nonuniform flow entering the combustor from the inlet. Experiments were conducted in the T4 Stalker tube to study the effects of these flow nonuniformities on boundary-layer combustion in a circular constant-area combustor. A rectangular-to-elliptical shape-transition inlet, typical of the type proposed for self-starting scramjets, was designed, manufactured, and attached upstream of the combustor in the current experiments. Numerical simulations of the flow through the rectangular-to-elliptical shape-transition inlet showed that the inlet generated a nonuniform outflow that had vortices, shock waves, and expansion waves. When tested at design-point inflow conditions, the total skin friction drag measured in the combustor was reduced by 61% when hydrogen burned in the boundary layer. These levels of reduction are similar to those measured in experiments conducted without a realistic scramjet inlet upstream of the combustor, thus demonstrating that the drag reduction brought about by boundary-layer combustion is not affected by the flow disturbances generated from the REST inlet. Tests conducted at off-design conditions further demonstrated that the drag reduction brought about by boundary-layer combustion was not affected by changes in the inflow conditions.",31,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35392,"Transonic high-pressure turbines are promising candidates for future aircraft engines. Recent studies in transonic turbine cascades showed that shock waves appeared over the uncooled flat tip, which affects its heat transfer. However, the effects of coolant injection on the thermal performance of transonic cooled tips are not clear. The current study aims to understand the thermal performance of a cooled flat tip and a cooled cavity tip in a transonic turbine cascade. The effects of tip film cooling are studied at five coolant pressure ratios (which are the stagnation pressure ratios of the coolant inlet and the cascade inlet) from 0.8 to 1.2. The flow physics over the tip, the heat transfer coefficient, the film-cooling effectiveness, and the heat flux of the tip are investigated. The effects of relative endwall motion are considered.",31,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35419,"Blade flutter of modern gas-turbine engines is one of the main issues that engine designers have to face. The most used numerical method that is employed for flutter prediction is the energy method. Although a lot of papers are devoted to the analysis of different blade wheels, this method was rarely validated by experiments. Typical mesh size, time step, and various modeling approaches that guarantee reliable flutter prediction are not commonly known, whereas some examples show that predictions obtained through nonvalidated codes can be inaccurate. In this paper, we describe our implementation of the energy method. Analysis of convergence and sensitivity to various modeling abstractions are carefully investigated. Numerical results are verified by compressor and full engine flutter test data. It is shown that the prediction of flutter onset is rather reliable so that the modeling approaches presented in this paper can be used by other researchers for the flutter analysis of industrial compressor blades.",31,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35713,"An efficient methodology for shape optimization based on computational fluid dynamics is developed and applied to a fundamental turbulated square duct. The present study uses a hybrid large-eddy simulation turbulence modeling approach for all computational fluid dynamics evaluation, as it is shown to give much more reliable results over a range of geometries. Four geometric parameters defining the cross-sectional profile and angle of the turbulators were optimized for two competing performance metrics: heat transfer and pressure drop. An initial database of computational fluid dynamics runs, sampled from the design space using a space-filling design of experiments, is used as a starting point. A metamodel is then fitted through the training data in the database. The metamodel provides the means for fast approximation of the objective functions at new design points, allowing the use of a genetic algorithm for this multiobjective optimization. The resulting Pareto front is verified with a second round of computational fluid dynamics evaluations at the end. The optimization demonstrates the potential for improvement in thermal performance when using turbulators with an upstream ramp. Various metamodels are also explored for their ability to deal with design space nonlinearity and noisy data.",31,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35433,"This paper develops the discrete adjoint equations for a turbomachinery Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver and proposes a framework for fully automatic gradient-based constrained aerodynamic shape optimization in a multistage turbomachinery environment. The systematic approach for the development of the discrete adjoint solver is discussed. Special emphasis is put on the development of the turbomachinery-specific features of the adjoint solver (that is, on the derivation of flow-consistent adjoint inlet and outlet boundary conditions) and, to allow for a concurrent rotor–stator optimization and stage coupling, on the development of an exact adjoint counterpart to the nonreflective, conservative mixing-plane formulation used in the flow solver. The adjoint solver is validated by comparing its sensitivities with finite difference gradients obtained from the flow solver. A sequential-quadratic programming algorithm is used to determine an improved blade shape based on the gradient information provided by the adjoint solution. Optimization within a sequential-quadratic programming framework avoids the time-consuming task to determine the weights of the individual constraints by including the constraints directly into the design problem. The functionality of the proposed optimization method is demonstrated by the redesign of two two-dimensional transonic compressor configurations. The design objective is to maximize the isentropic efficiency while constraining the mass flow rate and the total pressure ratio.",31,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35525,"It is nearly impossible to remove all resonant crossings from the operating range of a multistage compressor; thus, designers rely on models to predict the resonant response amplitude to determine if the crossing is acceptable. An accurate model can reduce unexpected forced-response problems encountered during engine testing. Although work has been done to improve such models, the confidence in these models comes from validation with quality test data including both the aerodynamic forcing function and the response of the blade row. Recent trends in turbomachinery, including higher blade loadings and use of integrally bladed rotors, lead to increased potential for forced-response issues. The Campbell diagram crossing for the excitation associated with the upstream and downstream vane rows on the embedded rotor first torsion vibratory mode is measured. The rotor response will be characterized with tip-timing measurements and the aerodynamic forcing functions measured. Unsteady casing pressures over the vibrating rotor are also acquired. This represents one of the few datasets detailing a forced-response condition in a multistage compressor, and the understanding gained from these experiments will be valuable in developing robust compressor designs.",31,5

Experiments are carried out in an icing wind tunnel under different icing conditions. The tests are performed at a freestream velocity of , an inlet angle of attack of 0 deg, and a freestream static temperature in the range of . The icing environment parameters include a mean volume diameter of , liquid water content in the range of 0.5 to . The experiment is performed on full-scale inlet guide vanes. The temperature distributions on the guide vane surface are measured by thermocouples. The leading-edge ice shapes of inlet guide vanes are compared under different icing conditions.

10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35672,"This paper focuses on the validation and application of a new one-equation eddy viscosity model derived from closure (the Wray–Agarwal model) for three-dimensional flows in serpentine diffusers (S ducts). The S-duct geometry produces streamline curvature and an adverse pressure gradient, resulting in flow separation. Two S-duct geometries are employed in this investigation: one was used in an experimental study conducted at NASA John H. Glenn Research Center in the early 1990s, and the other used in an experimental study conducted at ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab in 2006 and considered for computational fluid dynamics technology validation during the AIAA Propulsion Aerodynamics Workshops in 2012 and 2014. The computational fluid dynamics flow solver ANSYS Fluent is used for flow calculations. Results from the new “Wray–Agarwal” one-equation turbulence model, the widely used Spalart–Allmaras, and the shear-stress-transport models are compared to the available experimental data. Results obtained with the new Wray–Agarwal turbulence model are very promising. It is shown that this new model matches the experimental data better when compared to the Spalart–Allmaras and shear-stress-transport models.",31,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35439,"A method to optimize the spacing of decelerator electrodes in the standing-wave direct energy converter has been developed. The standing-wave direct energy converter is introduced as a simplified version of, and possible milestone toward, the traveling-wave direct energy converter to facilitate a general understanding of the physics of the traveling-wave direct energy converter, as well as to simplify the modeling and results. The standing-wave direct energy converter may also stand alone as an alternative to the traveling-wave direct energy converter. The method developed takes advantage of analytical simplifications in capacitance calculations to avoid the use of a computational mesh, thereby modeling the standing-wave direct energy converter system with low simulation runtimes while using explicit numerical methods to advance groups of ions, referred to as ion bunches. The optimization scheme returns the optimal electrode spacing and circuit resistance value given the inputs of the initial ion energy, ion bunch density, operating frequency, decelerator electrode radius, and number of decelerator electrodes. The method approximates the ion bunches as point charges on the axis of the device, and the limitations of this approximation are considered. The expansion of the ion bunch is treated analytically and imposes a limiting tradeoff between the density of the ion bunches and the duration of ion deceleration. Performance trends and other tradeoffs are also presented.",31,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35519,"Two-dimensional numerical simulations have been carried out with the objective of explaining the experimentally observed performance of a shock-tunnel-driven, high-temperature inert gas plasma Faraday-type magnetohydrodynamic generator with segmented electrodes. A maximum enthalpy extraction ratio of 13.1% is estimated for a load resistance of , which agrees well with the experimental result (12.9% for ). Current concentration at the upstream edges of the anode and the downstream edges of the cathode, which is due to the Hall effect, is successfully simulated. A large voltage drop is caused in the vicinity of the electrodes, which is attributed to a large Hall parameter arising due to the decrease in the electron number density in the region of the boundary layer. The plasma structure is streaky and unstable at an inlet total temperature of 7500 K; the structure becomes stable with an increase of inlet total temperature to 9000 K. Suppression of ionization instability can be attributed in part to the weakness of the dependency of the electrical conductivity on the electron number density as coulomb collision of electrons become dominant at higher inlet total temperatures.",31,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35686,"Computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out for a complete hypersonic vehicle integrating both external (nonreacting) and internal (reacting) flow together to calculate the scramjet combustor performance and vehicle net thrust minus drag. Simulations are carried out for a flight Mach number of about six. Three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations are solved along with the shear stress transport turbulence model and single-step chemical reaction based on fast chemistry. The Lagrangian particle tracking method for droplets is used for combustion of kerosene fuel. Flow is largely nonuniform at the inlet of the combustor. Mass flow of ingested air increases with increase in angle of attack. Because of more combustion of fuel, wall surface pressure is higher for compared with . Combustion efficiency and thrust achieved are found to increase with the increase in angle of attack. Considerable amount of thrust is obtained from a single expansion ram nozzle and achievement of positive thrust–drag for the whole vehicle is demonstrated. The computational analysis of the whole vehicle provides net forces and moments of the whole vehicle, which is very useful for the mission analysis of the vehicle.",31,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35221,"Testing of identical dual-mode scramjet flowpath geometries in the freejet and direct-connect configurations was conducted in two separate facilities. These tests enabled a comparison study between the two configurations, which was directed toward the determination of the effects of inlet distortion and backpressure on the performance and operability of a dual-mode scramjet. Bulk flow conditions were matched between the two facilities at the isolator entrance plane to simulate Mach 4.8 flight, and a series of metrics were established to quantify similarities and differences. The effects of flowpath backpressure in the direct-connect case were seen to be isolated to regions close to the exhaust. An approximate 10% decrease in combustor pressure rise and consequently integrated pressure force were observed in the freejet configuration; shock train length, however, remained the same. Mode transition was delayed from an equivalence ratio of in the direct-connect case to in the freejet configuration. Further, ignition difficulties were experienced in the freejet tests which were not encountered in those of direct-connect tests, limiting the scope of comparable test points. This work represents the first attempt at a quantitative comparison in the literature of an identical direct-connect and freejet dual-mode scramjet.",31,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35443,"Uniform seeding is important for particle image velocimetry due to the fact that all velocity data are derived from the movement of particles as fluid tracers. However, in some wind tunnel applications, uniform seeding is not possible due to the severe fouling of windows. One such application is in the University of Virginia Supersonic Combustion Facility. Past particle image velocimetry measurements in this facility have potential velocity bias errors due to nonuniform seeding, since particles were only introduced in the fuel stream and not the freestream of a dual-mode scramjet combustor. The present study seeks to experimentally quantify the velocity bias errors associated with introducing seed particles into a single stream of a fuel and freestream mixing and combusting region of the scramjet flowpath. The velocity bias is quantified by measuring the velocity field at the combustor exit using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry under three seeding scenarios: 1) fuel stream only seeded, 2) fuel and freestream seeded, and 3) freestream only seeded. The case of seeding both the fuel and freestream was taken as the baseline, or most ideal solution. The results indicate that the effect of the seeding bias is relatively small since seeding the fuel only results in an average seeding bias error of 3.7% in mean velocity and 2.5% for the case of freestream only seeded. For the rms velocity, the average error induced by the seeding bias was 6.6 and 4.1%, respectively.",31,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35630,"Because of viscous interaction in hypersonic flows, the state of the boundary layer significantly influences possible shock-wave boundary-layer interaction as well as surface heat loads. Hence, for engineering applications, the efficient numerical prediction of the laminar-to-turbulent transition is a challenging and important task. Within the framework of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, Langtry–Menter proposed the transition model using two transport equations for the intermittency and combined with the shear stress transport turbulence model. The transition model contains two empirical correlations for the onset and length of transition. Langtry–Menter designed and validated the correlations for the subsonic and transonic flow regimes. For applications in the hypersonic flow regime, the development of a new set of correlations proved necessary. Within this paper, we propose a next step and couple the transition model with the Speziale–Sarkar–Gatski/Launder–Reece–Rodi Reynolds stress turbulence model, which we found to be well suited for scramjet intake simulations. First, we illustrate the necessary modifications of the Reynolds stress model and the hypersonic in-house correlations using a hypersonic flat plate test case. Next, the transition model is successfully validated for its use coupled to both turbulence models using a hypersonic double ramp test case. Regardless of the turbulence model, the transition model is able to correctly predict the transition process compared to experimental data. In addition, we apply the transition model combined with both turbulence models to three different fully three-dimensional scramjet intake configurations that are experimentally investigated in wind tunnel facilities. The agreement with the available experimental data is also shown.",31,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35638,"Efficient mixing of fuel and air is a major objective for the successful operation of scramjet engines, in which the supersonic combustion process must occur within an extremely short time frame in the hypersonic flight. This paper presents the insights gained into the key design factors and underlying mechanism for fuel/air mixing enhancement with streamwise vortices introduced by alternating wedges called hypermixers. The results of a parametric numerical study and sensitivity analysis suggest that narrow spanwise intervals between the alternating wedges and large fuel/air equivalence ratios are beneficial for effective mixing, while higher total pressure recovery is associated with shallower ramp angles and lower fuel/air equivalence ratios. Higher fuel penetration is achieved with steeper ramp angles and higher fuel/air equivalence ratios. Streamwise vortex circulation increases with wider spanwise spacing and steeper ramp angles, but effective mixing enhancement is observed only in the latter case.",31,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35682,"Practical surface-tracking methods are successfully developed to simulate the evolution of the grain geometry, which is dynamically regressing during the combustion of the solid propellant. Three methods, namely the front-tracking, emanating-ray, and least-distance methods, are proposed. The front-tracking method is based on the Lagrangian approach, whereas both the emanating-ray and the least-distance methods are formulated from the Eulerian viewpoint. Three two-dimensional test cases have been examined to compare the programming complexity, simulation accuracy, and computational efficiency of the proposed methods. It is found that the least-distance method performs superior to the other two methods in many numerical respects. The least-distance method is implemented on the tetrahedron grid system to track the outwardly regressing surface of a three-dimensional cubical propellant. Comparison between the predicted erosive volume and burning surface area with the theoretical results yields satisfactory agreement. A grain design similar to one of the Falcon Launch V cases has been employed to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology in application to a practical three-dimensional grain burnback analysis.",31,5

This work reports the enhancement of the decomposition of lithium perchlorate by means of employing as a catalyst. The composite catalysts synthesized through the collosol-gelling method with different mole ratios were designed to strongly enhance decomposition through comparison with blank tests. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscope, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron spectra, and -TPR analyses. Results showed that a solid solution was formed in the catalysts. The composite catalysts showed more lattice defects, smaller crystallites, larger surface area, and more oxygen vacancies than pure CuO and samples because of the interaction of Ce and Cu ions. Lattice defects, especially the reduced surface sites (that is, , , and oxygen vacancies), played dominant roles in catalytic reactions of decomposition. In addition, a hypothetical mechanism for catalytic decomposition of the catalyst was proposed.",31,5

If the interface degums, the propellant burn surface area will change and the performance of internal ballistics will be adversely affected. In this study, two cases of motor failure are considered to investigate methods for improving the bond strength between the propellant grain and the liner interface, with the aim of achieving a tensile strength exceeding the requirement. Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene was used as the liner material. This hydroxyl-terminated-polybutadiene-based material was conditioned and processed under the conditions of 5–20 torr pressure and 60–70°C temperature. Further, toluene diisocyanate was considered as the hardener and its contents were increased in the liner by 0 (i.e., original content), 2, 5, 10, and 15% to obtain diisocyanate NCO/OH equivalence ratios of 1.035, 1.057, 1.087, 1.144, and 1.187, respectively. Thereafter, bond strength tests and analyses were conducted. The tensile strength gradually increased with increasing toluene diisocyanate content in the liner. The bond strength was found to increase after improving the liner, performing hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene heating and vacuum extraction pretreatments, and increasing the toluene diisocyanate content by 10%.",31,5

This work is the prosecution of a previous paper analyzing liquid injection in a lab-scale hybrid rocket. It is focused on the formulation of the most suitable simulation technique to represent another type of liquid injector, compared with the one described in the previous paper. It also aims at extending the computational fluid dynamics simulation approach to hybrid rockets of larger scales. To validate computational fluid dynamics output, experimental results coming from both a laboratory scale and an increased-scale engine have been used. The different geometries studied include an increased-scale engine with a cylindrical grain having no diaphragm, the same rocket with a one-hole diaphragm inside the fuel grain, and a lab-scale rocket with a one-hole diaphragm. Simulations are steady state, and combustion derives from a single-phase chemical reaction. Liquid injection is fully simulated for the oxidizer, but paraffin entrainment is neglected for the fuel. Computational fluid dynamics results show a good agreement with the corresponding experiments for the ballistic parameters of interest in this study: chamber pressure, efficiency, and .
