1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37731,"Slip in centrifugal compressors arises from imperfect guidance of the flow by the impeller blades and reduces the work input delivered by the impeller. Slip models are used to predict slip in preliminary design. However, slip models are typically calibrated with data that are not representative of modern aerospace compressors (i.e., pumps, turbochargers, or industrial compressors) and do not account for the variation of slip factor with operating condition. This Paper investigates the efficacy of slip models to predict the slip factor and work input for modern, high-speed impellers at design and off-design conditions. Three slip models are used to predict the performance of four well-known impellers in the open literature. All three slip models generally overpredict the slip factor, and the largest error in the prediction of slip factor typically occurs at maximum operating speed (design speed). In addition, the analysis shows a close correlation between slip factor and two key design parameters of machine Mach number and loading coefficient over the entire compressor operating range. Finally, error propagation analysis shows that the error in impeller work input is proportional to the error in slip factor scaled by the square of machine Mach number and reveals the inherent challenge in accurate prediction of work input for high-speed machines.",37,1

This small step acts as an artificial block that causes slight changes to the flow characteristics of small vortices generated near the fuel surface. The results show that using a fuel insert delayed the LFI occurrence. In addition, the location of the fuel insert played an important role in determining the level of LFI suppression as well as the phase difference between the combustion pressure and heat release . Properly locating two fuel inserts simultaneously in the axial direction completely changed the phase difference to , which caused the LFI to disappear completely.",37,1

The mass flow rate of gasification products attained the value of , and the ratio of the mass flow rates of the working gas and gasification products was 4.5. A semiempirical model for calculating the characteristics of the gasification process has been proposed. The mass flow rate of gasification products is shown to increase with the temperature of the working gas and with the amount of heat absorbed by the low-melting fuel material.",37,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37924,"The design phase of a rocket combustion chamber relies on the prediction of the wall heat fluxes, in order to optimize the components to prevent thermal damage. Based on the experimental data of a subscale single-injector combustion chamber at elevated pressure, this work thoroughly investigates the validity of a hybrid Reynolds–Averaged Navier–Stokes/Large Eddy Simulation turbulence model (namely, Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation [IDDES]) combined with efficient flamelet tables. The generation of non-adiabatic flamelets is hereby optimized compared with previous studies. The effects of chemistry and enthalpy losses are first investigated on a simplified laminar test case. Then, the influence of the grid resolution on the wall thermal loads of the single-injector combustion chamber is discussed in the context of IDDES. The use of coarser meshes increases the turbulent content of the core flow, leading to an enhanced thermal load in the rear part of the chamber. Nonetheless, all investigated meshes yield a very good agreement with the experimental data, confirming the robustness of the IDDES/non-adiabatic chemistry solver. The result is confirmed by a preliminary simulation of the same combustion chamber featuring film cooling. The IDDES/non-adiabatic flamelet model is therefore recommended as a valid alternative to the widely used wall-stress-modeled large-eddy simulation.",37,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37942,"Lean operation in the primary combustion zone of a gas turbine combustor is advantageous from reduction point of view. The present work deals with the influence of lean primary zone operation on combustion performance, emissions, and flame stability of a model gas turbine combustor with simplex atomizer. Air distribution is varied to operate the primary combustion zone from stoichiometric to leaner operating conditions , at fixed fuel flow rate and overall air–fuel ratio. Combustor performance is quantified with the help of gas temperature profile at exit and species concentrations at the end of primary zone. It is found that a primary zone equivalence ratio of 0.79 is optimal for high combustor efficiency and low emissions, with a stable flame. When the primary zone equivalence ratio approaches the lean blowout (LBO) limit , intermittent low–frequency, high-amplitude pressure oscillations arise, especially at higher primary zone air flow rates. Inclusion of a metallic ring in the primary combustion zone widens the equivalence ratio for flame stability, with a small reduction in combustion efficiency. It also reduces the noise level and suppresses the intermittent high-amplitude oscillations close to LBO.",37,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37948,"This Paper investigates the role of microcracks in Hall thruster wall erosion. The formation and growth of microcracks on the surface of M26 grade boron nitride composite due to repeated thermal shock was quantified, and the subsequent impact of microcracks on plasma erosion was assessed. Thermal shock cycles (20 → 800 → 20°C) were provided by a radiation oven to induce thermal stresses similar to those incurred by a Hall thruster wall. The average ratio of crack area to total area was observed to grow as a power law with subunity exponential from 4–5% before thermal cycling to 15–18% after 20 thermal shock cycles. Cycled and control samples were simultaneously exposed to argon plasma with average ion energy of 130 eV. All samples were observed to preferentially retain boron nitride relative to silica, and microcracks were not observed to significantly impact surface composition or feature development.",37,1

This Paper presents an active sensing in situ identification method based on the electromechanical impedance technique, which is particularly suited for monitoring aging of solid propellants. This Paper first instructs a one-dimensional viscoelastic electromechanical coupling impedance model. A relationship between the dynamic modulus of solid propellants and its mechanical impedance is established. Then numerical calculation and experimental verification of the viscoelastic impedance model are conducted. Experimental research on aging monitoring of real solid propellant rocket and thermal accelerated aging hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid propellant specimens are carried out. The results show that the real part of mechanical impedance curves decreases with the increase of aging time of solid propellants, and there is an approximate exponential relationship model between the peak value of real part of mechanical impedance and thermal accelerated aging time. It can be seen that the electromechanical impedance technique is an innovative method which can effectively characterize in situ the dynamic modulus of solid propellants, monitor the aging of solid propellants, and construct the aging life prediction model.",37,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37918,"Paraffin-based fuels incorporating solid amine boranes are investigated to identify formulations suitable for use as hypergolic hybrid rocket propellants. Their ignition delays are measured following contact with 90% white fuming nitric acid droplets. The mechanical properties of the paraffin binder and of the melt layer it produces are modified using an alpha-olefin polymer. The tests are carried out at atmospheric pressure, with visible flame light emission as well as chemiluminescence recorded. The ignition delays measured from both signals are nearly identical, confirming that emission begins at the same time as the visible light emission from the boron-containing additive mixed with the fuel. Identification of the different steps of the combustion process is done with a high-speed schlieren imaging technique. Consistently shorter ignition delays are obtained by increasing the proportion of polymerized alpha olefin. The effect of this addition on the viscosity of the melt layer produced in the fuel blend upon contact with the acid is inferred from rheological measurements realized on unburned samples. The effect of alpha-olefin addition on the theoretical thermochemical performance of the fuel is also computed. The results obtained confirm that polymer-based additives can be used to control mechanical and rheological properties in a way that lowers the ignition delays of hypergolic fuel systems based on paraffin, as required for use in space propulsion applications.",37,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37970,"This paper evaluates various sources of oxidizer to fuel mass ratio (O/F) shifts in hybrid rockets and paths (physical phenomena) through which these O/F shifts affect flight performance. Moreover, the performance increase of O/F control in hybrid rockets is evaluated. Vertical launches of O/F uncontrolled and O/F controlled of hybrid sounding rockets were simulated under two uncertainty models of fuel regression behavior based on experimental data: a) systematic errors with a constant deviation within and 2) random errors subject to a probability distribution. These simulations included all sources of O/F shifts that originated in the fuel regression behavior and all paths through which the O/F shifts affect flight performance. Residual propellant mass and decreases in specific impulse are found to be the dominant causes of performance loss under both uncertainty models. For both cases 1 and 2, the O/F-controlled hybrid rockets maintained the performance expected under nominal fuel regression behavior, whereas the O/F-uncontrolled hybrid rockets had a lower performance by upwards of 6.69 and 4.06% in for cases 1 and 2, respectively. For case 2, 3008 flight simulations revealed that the worst case of the O/F-controlled hybrid rocket had a 4.06 to 4.49% larger and 10.5 to 13.3% higher apogee than that of the O/F-uncontrolled hybrid rocket, and that the O/F-uncontrolled hybrid rocket had a 6.61 times larger standard deviation in . These results mean that the elimination O/F shift in hybrid rockets significantly improves performance, as well as the accuracy and reliability of performance predictions.",37,1

These unique salts can be employed to preferentially capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of the planet for subsequent processing. To explore this application, and argon solubility experiments were performed with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([BMIM][Tfo]) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([BMIM][Ac]) over partial pressures of 0–84 kPa. The benchtop data are then extrapolated to anticipated specifications required for a flight-scale capture system on Mars. An artificial increase in partial pressure from local atmospheric conditions (0.8 kPa) to 84 kPa will significantly reduce the required mass of ionic liquid due to enhanced uptake. Meanwhile, the mass and volume specifications of [BMIM][Ac] are more competitive than [BMIM][Tfo]. The time interval for capture with [BMIM][Ac] is also shown to be a driving factor in required mass because 81% of the maximum uptake capacity is absorbed in approximately a third of the time needed to fully load the ionic liquid with .",37,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37649,"The paper presents an efficient method for analyzing complex periodic unsteady flows within turbomachinery. The method transforms the original initial value problem of unsteady flows to a boundary value problem by taking advantage of temporal periodicity known a priori. This transform allows a pseudotime marching at all physical time instants to be performed simultaneously, for which the method is called the time vector marching (TVM) method. Time direction discretization can be achieved using finite difference schemes. A second-order backward scheme and a ninth-order mixed scheme are investigated. To demonstrate the stability, accuracy, and correctness of the TVM method, the one-dimensional (1-D) advection equation and a quasi-1-D Laval nozzle with time-varying inlet total pressures are used as the test cases. The unsteady flowfield within it was also analyzed using a time-domain dual time-stepping (DTS) method and the harmonic balance (HB) method to obtain the results as references. Further verification was carried out using a transonic compressor rotor with inlet absolute total pressure distortion. The phase-shift boundary condition was applied at geometric periodic boundaries to facilitate the use of a computational domain of one blade passage for a blade row. The time-averaged and instantaneous results of the DTS, HB, and TVM methods and associated time cost were compared and discussed.",37,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37853,"Nondeterministic analyses were performed on a one-dimensional, steady, chemically reacting, reduced-order model for hydrogen peroxide flow through a monopropellant catalyst bed. Polynomial chaos expansion was implemented to decrease sampling time in order to perform the probabilistic analyses including quantification of global sensitivities using Sobol indices, construction of axial property uncertainty envelopes for random inputs, and construction of posterior probability distributions with credible intervals for variation in chemical tuning parameters. Results from the study show that model behavior is primarily governed by propellant mass fraction and activation energy of the global reaction. Additionally, posterior distributions generated via Bayesian inference indicate that activation energy and the number of active sites per volume are related by a logarithmic family of solutions as a result of the reaction advancement gradient form in the model. A region of high probability activation energy and number of active sites per volume values are identified using Markov chain Monte Carlo to compare model predictions with experimental data across five individual test cases.",37,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37860,"During their operation, solid rocket boosters experience axial stresses caused among other things also by fluid mechanical loads from the internal flow. The accurate prediction of the flowfield is mandatory for an accurate prediction of axial stresses and strains during the mission. In the present Paper, a very efficient but still accurate approach is presented to simulate the internal flow featuring an erosive combustion process, which leads to a temporal variation of the fluid domain. The impact of the calculated fluid behavior on the calculation of axial strains is demonstrated using the example of a firing test, where it can be shown that by taking into account the fluid behavior a significant improvement on the axial strain prediction could be achieved compared to the previous method, in which the fluid mechanical impact partly had been neglected.",37,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37842,"Reactive and nonreactive Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations of hydrogen injection into a confined transverse supersonic flow of vitiated air are conducted. The corresponding conditions were studied in the LAPCAT-II combustor. Two operating conditions are considered, which differ in the value of the momentum ratio between the hydrogen and vitiated air inlet streams, thus leading to two distinct values of the equivalence ratio (ER). For its smallest value, smooth combustion develops subject to a preliminary thermal runaway period, while for its largest value, combustion is more strongly intertwined with shock wave dynamics and boundary layer separation. Special emphasis is placed on the possible effects of wall roughness on this reactive flow development. One among the conclusions of preliminary computational analyses of the present flowfield is that it may play a significant role on combustion development. This is firmly confirmed in the present study, which takes explicitly the influence of wall roughness into account within the equivalent sand grain modeling framework. For the largest ER value, the combustion stabilization mechanism is found to change dramatically whether roughness is taken into account or not. Its influence is assessed through a detailed comparison with available experimental data.",37,1
