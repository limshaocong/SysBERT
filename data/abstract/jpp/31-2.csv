This sensor has a floating head that can detect the local shear force using the flow passing over the head surface. Cold-flow wind-tunnel experiments were carried out with clustered nozzle models. The test models had three or four clustered cell nozzles, or a nonclustered two-dimensional nozzle with a designed Mach number of 3.5, followed by a straight planar section. The experimental conditions were chosen according to the cell nozzle jet expansions. Hence, some conditions involved an oblique shock wave impinging on the bottom surface and others did not. The measured local skin-friction coefficients were compared to those predicted by using an existing prediction model. The results showed that the local skin-friction value significantly increased when the cell nozzle expansion was under the overexpansion condition, whereas the measured values were identical to those predicted by the existing model under the underexpansion condition. The physics behind this observation showed that the expansion waves hardly affected the skin friction, but the oblique shock wave and crossing neighboring jet boundaries could increase the skin friction.",31,2

To quantify the aerodynamic mixing of the free jets with the fluid entrained from the surrounding environment, the jet centerline pitot pressure distribution and radial pitot pressure profiles along the major and minor axes directions of the jet were measured. The centerline pitot pressure variation of the orifice and nozzle jets shows that the decay of the jet from the nozzle is faster than the jet from the orifice at nozzle pressure ratios more than two. But at a nozzle pressure ratio of two, the decay of both the jets are close to each other. The pressure profiles demonstrate that the axis-switching location shifts upstream with an increase of nozzle pressure ratio for both the jets, implying that the near-field mixing is enhanced by the increase in the favorable pressure gradient. The waves prevailing in the jet field were visualized with the shadowgraph technique.",31,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35152,"This paper presents the application of a viscous continuous adjoint method for the optimization of a low-aspect-ratio turbine blade row through endwall contouring. A generalized wall-function method is implemented in a Navier–Stokes flow solver with Menter’s shear-stress transport turbulence model to simulate the secondary flow with reduced requirements on grid density. Entropy production through the blade row combined with a flow turning constraint is used as the objective function in the optimization. With the viscous adjoint method, at each design cycle, the complete gradient information needed for optimization can be obtained by solving the flow governing equations and their corresponding adjoint equations only once for each cost function, regardless of the number of design parameters. Flow loss through the blade row is minimized while maintaining the same mass-averaged flow turning at the design condition. The performance of the optimized blade at off-design conditions is also evaluated and compared with that of the original blade.",31,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35193,"Vane clocking is the relative circumferential indexing of adjacent vane rows with similar vane counts, and it affects discrete frequency noise, forced response, and stage performance in axial compressors. The objective of this paper is to investigate vane clocking effects on stator 2 loss for many loading conditions in a three-stage axial compressor. Although previous studies have focused on two or three operating conditions, this is the first to investigate vane clocking effects over many loading conditions. Detailed circumferential traverses of stagnation pressure were acquired for six clocking configurations at six different loading conditions: a low-loading condition, two conditions near design point, two high-loading conditions, and a near-stall condition. Stator 2 wake widths and depths were similar for different clocking configurations at low loadings, but the high-loading cases exhibited larger changes associated with vane clocking, especially near the stator hub. This resulted in different radial total pressure profile shapes for different clocking configurations that, coupled with flow visualization, showed that vane clocking modulates the hub corner separation for the high-loading operating condition. For design-loading and low-loading conditions, the differences in area-averaged stator 2 loss coefficients with vane clocking were small, but changes in loss increased at the high-loading condition and resulted in a 20.6% difference in loss coefficient between the minimum and maximum clocking cases, with local changes near the hub as much as 46.6%. The effect of clocking on vane loss lessened as the stall boundary was approached.",31,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35331,"Qualitatively different heat transfer characteristics between a transonic blade tip and a subsonic one have recently been discovered. High-resolution experimental data can be acquired for blade-tip heat transfer research using a high-speed linear cascade. A combined experimental and computational fluid dynamics study on several high-pressure turbine blade-tip configurations is conducted to understand the flow physics in both stationary and moving casing setups. Extensive tests measuring aerodynamic loss and heat transfer have been performed on a stationary squealer tip at engine-representative aerodynamic conditions. A systematic validation of the computational fluid dynamics solver (Rolls–Royce, plc. HYDRA code) is introduced, showing good agreement with the experimental data obtained. Relative casing movement effects are then evaluated for two tip configurations at three different tip gaps. The moving casing is shown to affect the aerothermal performance considerably; the trends are consistently captured for the large and medium tip gaps, both in the stationary and moving casing instances. Presented results confirm that, even with a moving casing, the blade tips remain transonic. It is also shown that the heat transfer is not only dependent on the tip gap size but also the tip-geometry configuration. The squealer cavity is subsonic regardless of the tip gap size, whereas the local flow state over a flat tip is much more responsive to tip gap size.",31,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35216,"Experimental and computational studies on the cavitating flow around a turbopump inducer were performed to see the effect of the cavitation on the performance of the inducer. The development of cavitation bubbles around the inducer blades and the head drop of the inducer are observed as the inlet pressure is reduced. The change of the backflow at the inducer inlet is also observed with the development of the cavitation bubbles. The size of the backflow decreases as the inlet pressure is reduced due to the development of the cavitation bubbles around the blades. The relation between the strength of the backflow and the shaft vibration during the head breakdown is analyzed qualitatively. The highest shaft vibration occurs at the onset of the cavitation head drop when the strength of the backflow starts to decrease. The vibration increases as the cavitation number decreases until the onset of the inducer head drop, and then it decreases concurrently with the reduction of the backflow in line with the weakened adverse pressure gradient near the leading edge of the inducer.The predicted suction performance of the inducer was compared with the experimental results. The results show that the computed values of the suction performance are higher than the values obtained through experiments.",31,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35235,"The optimization aims to maximize the film cooling performance while minimizing the corresponding aerodynamic penalty. The cooling performance is assessed using the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, while the aerodynamic penalty is measured with a mass-averaged total pressure loss coefficient. Two design variables are selected: the coolant-to-mainstream temperature ratio and the coolant-to-mainstream total pressure ratio. Two staggered rows of discrete cylindrical film cooling holes on the suction surface of a turbine vane are considered. A nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is coupled with an artificial neural network (ANN) to perform a multiple-objective optimization of the coolant flow parameters on the vane suction surface. Three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations are employed to construct the ANN network that produces low-fidelity predictions of the objective functions during the optimization. The effect of varying the coolant flow parameters on the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and the aerodynamic loss is analyzed using the optimization method and RANS simulations. The computational fluid dynamics predictions of the adiabatic film cooling effectiveness and aerodynamic performance are assessed and validated against corresponding experimental measurements. The optimal solutions are reproduced in the experimental facility and the Pareto front is substantiated with experimental data.",31,2

The measured emissions are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides. A unique emissions sample system was used, where the sample probe was located behind the final stage of the low-pressure turbine rotor, avoiding having any bypass air or ambient air in the emissions. The emission production patterns are evaluated with the engine parameters of fan speed, fuel flow, and exhaust gas temperatures. Characterizing the concentrations and emission indices at stable power settings, the results also contribute to arguments on the effects of hot and cold idles, probe locations, and ratios. Even though the present study differs from that of the International Civil Aviation Organization Aircraft Engine Emission Database in several respects, a comparison reveals relatively good agreement with regard to nitrogen oxides and reveals differences for carbon monoxide at low-power settings.",31,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35367,"A centrifugal particle mass analyzer and a modified differential mobility spectrometer were used to measure the mass and mobility of particulate matter emitted by CFM56-5B4/2P, CFM56-7B26/3, and PW4000-100 gas turbine engine sources. The mass-mobility exponent of the particulate matter from the CFM56-5B4/2P engine ranged from 2.68 to 2.82, whereas the effective particle densities varied from 600 to , depending on the static engine thrust and sampling methodology used. The effective particle densities from the CFM56-7B26/3 and PW4000-100 engines also fell within this range. The sample was conditioned with or without a catalytic stripper and with or without dilution, which caused the effective density to change, indicating the presence of condensed semivolatile material on the particles. Variability of the determined effective densities across different engine thrusts, based on the scattering about the line of best fit, was lowest for the diluted samples and highest for the undiluted sample without a catalytic stripper. This variability indicates that the relative amount of semivolatile material produced was engine thrust dependent. It was found that the nonvolatile particulate matter, effective particle density (in kilograms per cubic meter) of the CFM56-5B4/2P engine at relative thrusts below 30% could be approximated using the particle mobility diameter ( in meters) with .",31,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35425,"A mixed-compression supersonic inlet with a variable throat can solve the contradiction of the starting capability at low Mach numbers and the total pressure recovery performance at high Mach numbers. However, the variation of the throat area is rather difficult for an axisymmetric supersonic inlet. A new method based on a deforming air cell to control the throat area of an axisymmetric inlet is brought forward and investigated by both experimental and computational methods. The morphing behavior of the deforming air cell in a supersonic wind tunnel is also obtained. The results indicate that the contraction ratio of the inlet can be effectively controlled by the cooperation of the air cell profile under different charging pressures and the cowl inner surface. As compared with a fixed geometry inlet, the total pressure recovery and the corresponding maximum backpressure of the morphing inlet are increased by 25.7 and 31.8%, respectively. In addition, the air cell can withstand the impact of strong oscillatory flows when the inlet experiences buzz.",31,2

The test apparatus contained an annular isolator, a constant cross-sectional area cylindrical supersonic combustor, and a subsonic-burning gas generator. The gas generator, in which a liquid hydrocarbon fuel was injected, produced a fuel-rich hot-gas mixture that is mixed with the annular supersonic airflow in the supersonic combustor. A precombustion compression field was generated, both in the isolator and the combustor, by the heat release. The annular isolator entrance Mach number was varied as 1.78, 1.98, and 2.23. The wall static pressure distributions measured in the isolator and the combustor are presented and analyzed to determine the precombustion shock-train length. The new correlating equations and the corresponding theoretical model that can predict the precombustion shock-train length and the wall pressure distribution are derived therefrom.",31,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35222,"Numerical predictions of a lobed jet mixing flow within an S-shaped nozzle were conducted with respect to the influence of lobe scarfing on performance of the lobed S-shaped nozzle. The simulation results presented in this paper were all obtained by solving compressible steady three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with a realizable turbulence model. The effect of scarfing optimization was mainly addressed by both the flowfield downstream of the lobed mixer and the interested variables characterizing the performance of the lobed S-shaped nozzle. Due to the studied S-shaped nozzle, a sharp decrease of total pressure recovery coefficient, as well as a reduced thermal mixing efficiency, within the flowfield close to the outlet is shown. The model with a bigger scarfing angle is suggested to induce the forced mixing process ahead of schedule, but with less mixing strength as compared with the baseline model. However, the model with a more aggressive scarfing angle is shown to be the case with both a decreased thermal mixing efficiency and an augmented total pressure recovery coefficient within the flowfield downstream of the cross section, except the 20 deg scarfing model. Both the thrust coefficient and thrust mixing efficiency are all found to decrease as a result of the tested model with a bigger scarfing angle.",31,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35369,"The scope of this study is to predict the combustion performance of a ducted rocket combustor. Connected-pipe combustion experiments and numerical analysis of the internal reacting flow in a ducted rocket combustor were conducted at various equivalence ratios with an emphasis on the air inlet geometry effect. The considered equivalence ratio in experimental and numerical investigations varied between 0.35 and 1.57 in order to reflect the variable-flow conditions of the ducted rockets. Three kinds of combustors have been used in order to evaluate the air inlet geometry effect: a two-inlet combustor with an inlet angle of 90 deg, a two-inlet combustor with an inlet angle of 180 deg, and a four-inlet combustor with an inlet angle of 90 deg. The behavior of the carbon particles within the fuel-rich gas stream was investigated and found to have a major effect on the temperature rising. The four-inlet combustor exhibited the best combustion efficiency, and the two-inlet combustors did not show large differences in terms of performance. The numerical model showed sufficient predictability within 6% accuracy in comparison with experimental temperature for all test conditions.",31,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35488,"Modeling tools used to estimate thermoacoustic combustion instabilities include classic network models, three-dimensional frequency-domain acoustic solvers, and computational fluid dynamics. Motivated by the large gap in both computational cost and predictive capability between the first two tools and computational fluid dynamics, the present work discusses and tests an approach that bridges this gap: a three-dimensional finite volume, acoustic solver in the time domain. Distinguishing features of the newly developed solver include the ability to capture both linear and nonlinear acoustics, the use of a solution algorithm based on an approximate Riemann solver, and the ability to handle complex geometries with unstructured meshes. This new solver produces results that agree well with analytical solutions for a two-dimensional isothermal cavity and a one-dimensional Rijke tube, as well as with the experimental data of a reheat buzz. For this last problem, a limit cycle is produced with a physical model that bounds heat-release fluctuations. In addition, results from the new acoustic solver for an annular combustor compare well with those of a three-dimensional frequency-domain acoustic solver, demonstrating the capabilities of the new solver to capture multidimensional acoustics.",31,2

In this paper, an unsteady numerical model is presented. The model is composed of three submodels linked together: 1) zero-dimensional model of the combustion chamber, 2) one-dimensional (1-D) radial model of the fuel grain, and 3) zero-dimensional model of the feeding system. The first model simulates combustion chamber dynamics. The one-dimensional radial model of the fuel grain includes both standard polymeric and liquefying propellants characterized by a melting layer. The fuel block models the heat exchange to the wall, the heat propagation through the solid/liquid phase, and the fuel surface evaporation/entrainment. Finally, the injection system block simulates the unsteady behavior of the feeding line and droplets break-up-evaporation dynamics. In this paper, all the blocks are presented together with their validation versus analytical test cases. For each block, an analysis of the effect of the influencing parameters on the transient thruster behavior is presented.",31,2

High-frame-rate shadowgraphy and planar laser-induced fluorescence of the nitric oxide molecule showed the structure and time-dependent interaction of the detonation plume with the supersonic flow. The high-momentum flux from the detonation provided significant penetration, with blowdown times of 4–8 ms achieved. Planar laser-induced fluorescence of nitric oxide captured the spanwise structure of the plume and the large counter-rotating vortex structure for enhanced mixing. The upstream jet was shown to be drawn into the pulse detonator’s plume, providing distribution to the core supersonic flow. Significant coupling between a continuous upstream jet and the pulse detonator plume was found and indicated that there was an optimal staging distance for enhanced mixing.",31,2

This microslug-formation phenomenon has been proposed as the basis for a fuel-injection system in a novel, discrete monopropellant microthruster design for use in next-generation miniaturized satellites. Experimental work by McCabe et al. ( “ A Micro-Scale Monopropellant Fuel Injection Scheme Using Two-Phase Slug Formation ,” Journal of Propulsion and Power , Vol.  27 , No.  6 , 2012 , pp.  1295 – 1302 ) demonstrated the ability to generate fuel slugs with characteristics commensurate with the intended application. In this work, numerical modeling and simulation is used to further study this problem and identify the sensitivity of the slug characteristics to key material properties including surface tension, contact angle, and fuel viscosity. These concerns are of practical concern for this application due to the potential for thermal variations and/or fluid contamination during typical operation. For each of these properties, highly stable regions exist where the slug characteristics are essentially insensitive to property variations. Next, a series of three-dimensional simulations were performed to study the effects of channel depth on the slug-formation process. These simulations show that the relative slug volume and the detachment location increase with channel depth. Over the range of depths studied, the relative slug volume increased by up to 20% and the detachment location increased by 10 channel widths. The results demonstrate the impact of three-dimensional effects on the ability of the system to throttle the fuel flow rate to a level necessary for low thrust applications, which will have ramifications on the design and manufacture of the microthruster system.",31,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35370,"The influence of the secondary flow injection angle on a fluidic shock control technique that is used to control the ramp shock of supersonic and hypersonic inlets is studied in this paper. The differential equation of the momentum thickness of the boundary layer, the injection ratio, and the secondary flow injection angle is first deduced. Then, the relation of the secondary flow injection ratio with the displacement of the first ramp shock is established. Based on this, a theoretical prediction method of the required secondary mass flow ratio for a given shock control requirement is developed in an iterative manner and then validated by both numerical simulations and wind-tunnel tests. The theoretical analysis shows that the momentum thickness development rate of the boundary layer is closely related to the dimensionless tangential velocity of the secondary flow and the injection ratio. Although the desired displacement of the first ramp shock remains the same, the required secondary mass flow ratio decreases substantially with the increase of injection angle. The results obtained by wind-tunnel tests and three-dimensional computations also show that the accuracy of the prediction method is satisfactory.",31,2

A methane-burning vitiated air heater was designed and made to simulate the flight environment of Mach 6 at a 25 km altitude. Based on the two-dimensional numerical flowfield results, a new quasi-one-dimensional numerical method was established to simplify the unsteady combustion and flow of the solid-fuel scramjet. This method can be used to calculate the parametric changing process of the combustor quickly. Self-ignition and fuel regression rate characteristics in the current experiment were consistent with the results from previous works. The agreement between the numerical and the experimental results was generally good as well. The specific thrust can reach a level of in the designed flight environment.

The porous silicon is ignited by an electrical current passed through 100-nm-thick aluminum film deposited on the unpolished side of the wafer and the ignited porous silicon caused strong explosion, which destroys the chip into tiny fragments. The explosion impulse in the system can reach about at optimal conditions, which is two orders stronger than the impulse produced by conventional propellants ( Zakar E. , “ Technology Challenges in Solid Energetic Materials for Micro Propulsion Applications ” U.S. Army Research Lab. Rept.  ARL-TR-5035 , Nov. 2009 ). It is also shown that, by varying the etching time, which is an important factor that determines the porous layer thickness and the volume of nanocrystallite, the strength of the impulse can be tuned. Furthermore, a linear increasing trend of the explosion impulse with etching time is observed, which can be explained as the results of heat trapping, materials confinement, and the increasing number of reaction centers.",31,2

Pure hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene has been tested as a baseline fuel and compared to hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene loaded with nano- or micrometer-sized aluminum, nanosized Viton®-coated aluminum, magnesium hydride, magnesium, nanosized iron, and iron with magnesium. After a first exploratory test series in which both radial- and axial-injection arrangements have been analyzed, an axial nozzle has been selected to feed oxygen into single-port fuel grains; in that configuration, the port diameter effect upon the regression rate has been further investigated, revealing faster regression with larger port diameters at a given mass flux. The outcomes in terms of regression rate, combustion efficiency, and motor stability are examined. A thorough comparison with the available literature has been drawn, demonstrating that a clear regression-rate improvement trend has not been established yet. Current test results show a moderate average regression-rate increase (on the order of 10%) over the pure fuel, though considerably high characteristic-velocity and impulse efficiencies (on average, around 95 and 92%, respectively) have been achieved. Stable combustion has been observed in all the tested conditions with all the fuel combinations considered, excluding hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene containing uncoated nanoaluminum, with which high-amplitude, very low-frequency pressure oscillations have occurred. A tentative explanation of this behavior is proposed, resorting to large metal particle periodic accumulation on the nozzle surface.",31,2

The droplets are sampled downstream from the fuel grain at a certain distance from the burning surface. This allows the large vortices present in the flow to divert mainly smaller droplets away from the sampling probe, leading to a systematic bias in favour of the larger particles. By adjusting the size distribution of the injected particles in the numerical simulations, the experimental results have been reproduced numerically. Under the assumption that the hypothesis underlying the numerical simulations are valid, this size distribution would directly correspond to the particle sizes as they emerge from the surface of the propellant.",31,2

Absolute spectral radiances were recorded for collisions between beams of krypton ions (either singly or doubly charged) and electrons with a Kr gas at charged particle energies relevant to electrostatic thruster plasmas. The most prominent emissions observed are in the near-infrared region from a low-lying excited electronic state of neutral Kr. In the case of systems, the emission-excitation cross section from this low-lying excited electronic state of neutral Kr has a threshold at approximately 12.5 eV in the center-of-mass frame, and it increases with collision energy until 200 eV, where it remains constant through 600 eV.

The magnetohydrodynamic generator is composed of a magnetic field of about 0.5 T and a pair of electrodes on the surface of a blunt body with an overall diameter of 3.4 m. Numerical results demonstrate that the generator performance changes drastically along the flight path. At high altitudes, such as 60 and 64 km, the magnetohydrodynamic generator can extract power outputs at a sub-megawatt to megawatt level, whereas at low altitudes, such as 52 km, the magnetohydrodynamic generator is not useful for onboard power generation because of the shortage of electrical conductivity in the shock layer. Furthermore, the results show that the ion slip effect has a nonnegligible negative influence on the generator performance and that the influence of the ion slip effect becomes stronger with an increase in flight altitude and load voltage. The results at an altitude of 64 km indicate that the ion slip effect reduces the peak power output by 22%.",31,2
