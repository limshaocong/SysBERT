Experimentally determined mole fractions from a previous study were used to optimize the chemical kinetic model, using the solution mapping method. The optimization process produced a model that could predict the gaseous reformate for S-8 fuel. The results for JP-7, JP-8, and JP-10 identified shortcomings in the model due to both the models and the optimization process.",29,4

Techniques that can significantly reduce these simulation times are of great interest to model developers and the broader propulsion and power community. Two new integration methods using graphical processing units are presented that can rapidly integrate the nonlinear ordinary differential equations at each grid point. The explicit graphical processing-unit-enabled fourth-order-accurate Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg ordinary differential equation solver achieved a maximum speed up of 20.2x over the baseline implicit fifth-order-accurate DVODE CPU run time for large numbers of independent ordinary differential equation systems with comparable accuracy. The graphical processing unit implementation of DVODE achieved a maximum speed up of 7.7x over the baseline CPU run time. The performance impact of mapping one graphical processing unit thread to each ordinary differential equation system was compared with mapping an entire graphical processing unit thread block per ordinary differential equation (i.e., multiple threads per ordinary differential equation). The one-thread-per-ordinary-differential-equation approach achieved greater overall speed up but only when the number of independent ordinary differential equations was large. The one-block-per-ordinary-differential-equation implementation of Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg and DVODE both achieved lower peak speed ups, but outperformed the serial CPU performance with as few as 100 ordinary differential equations. The new graphical processing-unit-enabled ordinary differential equation solvers demonstrate a method to significantly reduce the computational cost of detailed finite rate combustion simulations.",29,4

This paper presents scaling rules for the performance of miniature two-stroke piston engines that are candidates for battery replacements in miniature unmanned vehicles and man-portable electronic systems. In so doing, it quantifies the current state of the art in small engine performance and provides a means to estimate a minimum thermodynamically sensible length scale for a two-stroke engine. The scaling rules are derived from comprehensive dynamometer investigations of nine of the smallest commercially available internal combustion engines. Engine mass ranges from 15 to 500 g, displacement ranges from 0.16 to , power outputs range from 8 to 650 W, and overall efficiency ranges from 3 to 12%. Peak torque, power, and normalized power follow power law scaling relationships with engine displacement. Efficiency and brake mean effective pressure follow similar scalings until approximately , where they begin to drop precipitously. The data show that the minimum length scale of a thermodynamically viable piston engine based on present technology is approximately 5 mm (displacement ). A companion paper (Menon, S., and Cadou, C. P., “Scaling of Miniature Piston-Engine Performance, Part 2: Energy Losses,” Journal of Propulsion and Power, doi:10.2514/1.B34639) quantifies the losses that drive the scaling results.",29,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34639,"Previous work based on measurements of the overall performance of small, ( displacement) two-stroke piston engines has shown that power and efficiency decrease more rapidly with size in miniature ( displacement) than in larger-scale engines. The present work seeks explanations for these trends by using energy balance analyses to identify and quantify the principal loss mechanisms in miniature engines. Energy losses in order of decreasing importance are found to be: incomplete combustion, heat transfer, sensible enthalpy in the exhaust, and friction. This ordering is almost opposite to that observed in conventional-scale engines. The results show that the scale-dependence of thermal and mechanical efficiency drive the drop in overall efficiency but that the biggest problem is incomplete combustion that consumes 50–60% of the fuel energy. Power output decreases somewhat less rapidly than efficiency because delivery ratio increases with decreasing scale in the set of engines investigated here. Taken together, the results indicate that improving the combustion process at a small scale is the first step toward building high performance miniature piston engines with practical levels of efficiency.",29,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34673,"By inserting a second regenerator in the connecting duct of a -Stirling engine, a so-called hybrid cycle is created, featuring both mechanical power generation and a heat pump effect. This cycle can be converted into a Vuilleumier heat pump cycle by adding a fourth cylinder volume on the reverse side of the compression piston. So, it is possible to devise a convertible machine that can be operated in these three modes depending on current demands, and that therefore offers remarkable opportunities as a decentralized residential energy supply system due to its variable heat-to-power ratio, particularly if a larger number of such machines are operated under central control to cut peak power demands and to generally optimize energy supply grids according to macroeconomic criteria. To experimentally demonstrate the feasibility at a reduced manufacturing and operating effort, a similarity-based scaling procedure is applied to an original full-scale design, which was previously optimized for typical operating conditions derived from statistical data and for minimum series production costs. This first part of a two-part contribution primarily addresses the theory and the limitations of this scaling procedure, as well as possible means to correct any associated errors, and present the experimental design.",29,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34726,"This contribution deals with the first experimental realization of a novel machine configuration that can be toggled between three different operation modes: a Stirling engine as an efficient cogeneration unit, a thermally driven Vuilleumier heat pump, and an intermediate “hybrid” cycle, combining both a heat pump effect and a mechanical power generation. Thus, a demand-oriented heat and power supply can be realized. Initially, such a machine was designed under both thermodynamic and production-oriented aspects. Subsequently, rules of similarity-based scaling have been applied to this design to reduce both experimental and manufacturing efforts. Hereby, all relevant dimensionless numbers are kept constant, such as Reynolds or Mach numbers, and particularly efficiencies and heat ratios, too. This laboratory-scale machine has been built and operated for almost 500 h. The experimental results obtained from this machine are presented and discussed, including , -indicator diagrams for the three operation modes and various loss phenomena (e.g., thermal losses to the ambient or friction losses in the crank mechanism). Furthermore, the results will be compared with the predictions of a one-dimensional differential simulation model. The deviations and the corrections required to account for similarity violations are discussed.",29,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34704,"To achieve reliable transmission of detonation waves to a pulse detonation engine combustor (detonation chamber), the authors propose a pulse detonation engine initiator that uses a cylindrical reflector downstream of a predetonator exit. The detonation wave propagates around the reflector to change the wave shape in three transition stages: from a planar detonation wave in the predetonator to an expanding cylindrical detonation wave, from the cylindrical wave to a planar toroidal detonation wave, and from the toroidal wave to a planar detonation wave in the detonation chamber. The cylindrical wave propagates along a cylindrical path between the reflector and front wall of the detonation chamber, and the toroidal wave propagates along an annular path between the reflector and sidewall of the detonation chamber. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the gap width of the annular path on the transition stages from cylindrical to toroidal and from toroidal to planar. A series of experiments that filled the entire test section with the driver gas mixture (stoichiometric hydrogen–oxygen mixture) showed that the expanding cylindrical detonation wave was sufficiently strong to survive the rarefaction waves from the corners of the reflector at all of the investigated annular gap widths (5, 10, 15, and 20 mm) and was transmitted to the planar toroidal wave successfully in all cases. When the strength of the cylindrical detonation wave was under a supercritical condition for diffraction at the reflector corner, the necessary filling distance for the driver gas was predicted well by the Whitham theory. A second series of experiments showed the influence of the annular gap width on the detonation transition from the planar toroidal detonation wave to the planar detonation wave. Two different types of detonation transitions termed “continuous transition” and “temporal quenching” were observed. The threshold value of for continuous transition is approximately four.",29,4

To design inlets that integrate well with planar vehicle bodies, a method was developed by Smart to produce rectangular-to-elliptical shape transition inlets. However, these inlets lose their advantage of tight integration when used on nonplanar bodies such as a conical vehicle. In this paper, that design technique is generalized to produce inlets that integrate with arbitrary body shapes. As an example, the design of a body-integrated hypersonic inlet on a winged-cone vehicle is shown, typical of what might be used in a three-stage orbital launch system.",29,4

The main objective of the study has been to analyze the inlet flow before and during buzzing. Experiments have therefore been carried out with an inlet without and with boundary-layer bleed at an angle of attack of 0 deg and at Mach numbers ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 in the Trisonic Wind Tunnel Cologne. The inlet flow was analyzed with schlieren images and unsteady pressure recordings, where different pressure fluctuations are detected. The results show that the inlet flow is highly unsteady even at supercritical condition and that the subsequently added boundary-layer bleed permits better pressure recovery and a delay in inlet buzzing.",29,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34669,"Limitations induced by flow separation at liftoff of launcher core engines can be overcome with the use of a new nozzle concept recently proposed. This device is able to prevent separation in an overexpanded nozzle. Consequently, a lower nozzle-exit pressure is possible at sea level and low altitudes, allowing for engine throttling or for the use of a nozzle with larger nozzle expansion-area ratios. To assess the actual potential of payload growth given by the application of such a device, the ascent trajectory must be evaluated and possibly optimized. A fast and reliable in-house code, based on the optimal-control theory, is used to optimize the ascent trajectory. Results show that the ideal velocity gain can be increased with throttling. However, ascent losses offset this benefit and reduce the actual payload; in any case, the launcher experiences lower dynamical loads and gains flexibility. On the other hand, payload improvements from the increase in the nozzle expansion-area ratio of the core engine may be obtained, depending on how large the penalty of the increased nozzle weight is.",29,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34812,"Understanding the impact of out-of-round nozzle extension on the nozzle side load during engine transient startup operations has garnered special interest from design engineers of late. The out-of-round nozzle extension could be the result of asymmetric internal stresses, deformation induced by previous tests, and asymmetric loads induced by hardware attached to the nozzle. The objective of this study was to computationally investigate the effect of out-of-round nozzle extension on the nozzle side loads during an engine startup transient. The rocket engine studied encompasses a regeneratively cooled chamber and nozzle, along with a film-cooled nozzle extension. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and on transient inlet boundary flow properties derived from an engine system simulation. Six three-dimensional cases were performed, with the out of roundness achieved by three different degrees of ovalization, elongated on lateral and axes: one slightly ovalized, one more ovalized, and one significantly ovalized. The results show that the separation line jump was the primary peak side-load physics. Compared with the peak side load of the perfectly round nozzle, the peak side loads increased most for the slightly ovalized nozzle extensions. The peak side loads then reduced moderately from the slightly ovalized nozzle extensions to the more ovalized nozzle extensions. For the significantly ovalized nozzle extensions, the peak side loads dropped substantially from those of the slightly ovalized nozzle extensions, due to increased flow directionality.",29,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34413,"Flow separation that occurs over low-pressure turbine blades at low Reynolds numbers has been a cause of concern due to its detrimental effect on engine performance. In the present study, the effect of microjet actuation, a low-mass, high-momentum device, is demonstrated for the elimination of separation on a low-pressure turbine blade over a wide range of Reynolds numbers using a range of complementary diagnostics, which include the surface pressure, velocity field, and wake-loss measurements. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory L1A low-pressure turbine blade used in this study is a highly aftloaded profile that experiences a nonreattaching separation at approximately 60% axial chord at low Reynolds numbers. Baseline blade pressure distributions as well as wake-loss coefficient measurements show that the blade experiences nonreattaching separation for Reynolds numbers based on axial chord less than 50,000 for a freestream turbulence intensity of 1% with steady inlet conditions. Microjet-based control was activated at various blowing ratios for each Reynolds number of interest. The integrated wake-loss coefficient was reduced by 85% with microjet control at low Reynolds numbers. Ensemble-averaged particle image velocimetry velocity fields show an elimination of reverse flow on the blade’s suction surface when steady microjets were activated at the optimum blowing ratio during low Reynolds number conditions. Turbulence statistics found through particle image velocimetry showed a concomitant dramatic reduction in unsteady velocities with control. Boundary-layer reattachment is attributed to the increase of local streamwise vorticity caused by the microjets (jets in crossflow), which lead to enhanced freestream entrainment to the near wall. The boundary layer is further energized due to enhanced turbulent mixing far downstream of the microjets. It was also observed that excessive control at high blowing ratios actually leads to a much larger separation. Prior studies applying active control on low-pressure turbines have shown the effectiveness of pitched and skewed vortex-generating jets for eliminating flow separation. The current study demonstrates that simple, normally issuing microjets with zero pitch angles and very low mass flow can be as effective as vortex-generating jet actuators for low-pressure turbine flow control.",29,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34729,"Engine windmilling and relight performance is a matter of safety in aviation. Two of the most important properties that engine designers must have a feeling for, even from the very early design stages, are the windmilling engine mass flow and internal drag. However, only empirical approaches are available so far to perform such studies. This work is focused on the development and validation of a first principles methodology for the prediction of the aforementioned properties, based on the simple frictional flow theory. Considerations about the modeling of the pressure loss factors are also made. Validation of the method is carried out by comparing the predicted windmilling drag and mass flow against test data of several high-bypass civil engines for a typical range of operating conditions. The results compare favorably with the test data, proving the robustness and reliability of this approach. Fully dimensionless parameters are defined to describe the windmilling performance, independent of the engine design and operating conditions. This research contributes to the preliminary engine development phases, because engine studies can be conducted using minimal geometrical information, allowing for a reliable prediction of the windmilling properties.",29,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34636,"Vane clocking is the circumferential indexing of adjacent vane rows with similar vane counts. There are no reports in the open literature regarding clocking effects on stall margin. Recent vane clocking investigations showed a measurable impact on embedded stage efficiency in a three-stage axial compressor research facility. The current work aims to determine the change in stall margin with vane clocking in this multistage compressor facility. Six clocking configurations were investigated, and the onset of stall was measured using unsteady pressure transducers flush-mounted in the casing at the leading edge of each rotor row. Data were acquired while clocking the embedded stage, the stage with measurable efficiency changes associated with vane clocking. Data were also acquired while clocking the first stage, the stalling stage. The changes in stall margin for different clocking configurations for this compressor were small and within the measurement uncertainty, although a weak sinusoidal trend was present. Thus, it is possible to change the stage efficiency using vane clocking without impacting stall margin. Total pressure profiles suggest that clocking effects are limited to a particular range of operation, and as the compressor reaches very high loading conditions, the differences in wake profiles associated with vane clocking diminish.",29,4

Molecular dynamics calculates the motions of the ions and ion clusters of liquid gallium in a high electric field after they are extracted from a platinum capillary. Liquid gallium at 320 K is simulated with a modified ion–ion potential model. The platinum capillary at 320 K is modeled using a three-zone wall model with a Langevin thermostat, and the flow rate at is generated by the fluidized piston model. The insertion part of a grand canonical ensemble is adopted to supply ions of liquid gallium constantly into the platinum capillary.

15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34607,"Results from a long duration test of a cusped-field plasma thruster operating at an anode power of 165 W are presented and discussed. Profile measurements of the boron nitride insulator were performed before and after the 204 h test, enabling the quantification of average erosion rates over a large portion of the interior. Unlike most Hall thrusters, the lifetime is not limited by erosion near the exit plane, due to the positioning of magnetic circuit elements. Additionally, the maximum erosion rate is found to be lower than rates measured in low-power Hall thrusters. The lifetime of this laboratory prototype is estimated at 920–1220 h based on the time needed to erode through the insulator in one of the ring cusps. However, as an indicator of the potential for cusped-field thruster designs to obtain longer lifetimes, the low erosion rate measurements are more significant. For example, fortifying cusps with additional or more durable material could increase lifetime. A summary of long duration tests and erosion measurements in Hall thrusters is also provided. During the tests discussed here, the thruster operated in the “high-current” mode, characterized by strongly oscillatory anode currents. Peak erosion rates are located upstream of the exit in this mode of operation. Reliable performance measurements were not acquired during this test, but anode current values suggest the thruster did not operate with the desired anode efficiency.",29,4

A radio-frequency generator supplies up to 2000 W to the radio-frequency plasma thruster at a fixed frequency of 13.56 MHz. The matching network is placed inside the vacuum chamber at the thruster, and the radio-frequency power is measured at the matching network input port with a dual-directional coupler. A Faraday probe measures the current density in the far-field exhaust of the thruster, a retarding potential analyzer characterizes the ion voltage distribution, and a Langmuir probe measures the plasma potential. The radio-frequency plasma thruster is operated with argon propellant at mass flow rates of , at corresponding corrected facility pressures of . The maximum thrust observed is 10.8 mN, and the maximum specific impulse is 303 s. Thrust efficiency is below 1% at all conditions. Faraday probe results show that the propellant utilization efficiency is below 15% and that the ionized exhaust has an effective divergence half-angle of 48 deg. Thrust is negatively correlated with the ion beam most probable voltage, showing that retarding potential analyzer results alone may not accurately characterize thruster performance.

The arc voltage is found to vary linearly with the discharge current, giving an arc impedance of . An exhaust velocity of is found by using the mass bit and computing the electromagnetic thrust from the discharge current data.

The coaxial magnetoisolated longitudinal anode represents a significant departure from conventional Hall thrusters and has not been thoroughly studied yet. The high efficiency of the thruster, as validated by measurements, increases the need for a better understanding of the physical processes in this type of thruster. An analysis of the coaxial magnetoisolated longitudinal anode discharge based on experimental measurements was conducted for this aim. The experimental setup includes electrical probes mounted on a fast moving positioner, enabling one to obtain the spatial distribution of plasma parameters inside the thruster channel. The results confirmed the basic assumptions used in the physical model of the coaxial magnetoisolated longitudinal anode concept and revealed new phenomena related to the radial nonuniformity of the discharge.

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34711,"This paper develops a novel strategy for prediction of lean blowout in gas turbine combustors based on symbolic analysis of time series data from optical sensors, where the range of instantaneous data is partitioned into a finite number of cells and a symbol is assigned to each cell. Depending on the cell to which a data point belongs, a symbolic value is assigned to the data point. Thus, the set of time series data is converted to a symbol string. The (estimated) state probability vector is computed based on the number of occurrence of each symbol over a given time span. For the purpose of detecting lean blowout in gas turbine combustors, the state probability vector obtained at a condition sufficiently away from lean blowout (reference state) is considered as the reference vector. The deviation of the current state vector from the reference state vector is used as an anomaly measure for early detection of lean blowout. The results showed that the rate of change of the anomaly measure with equivalence ratio changed significantly as the system approached lean blowout. This change in slope of the curve was observed approximately at a similar proximity to lean blowout for different operating conditions and, hence, could be used as an early lean blowout precursor. The actual location of the change of slope depended primarily on the choice of reference state. This technique performed satisfactorily over a wide range of premixing.",29,4
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34747,"This experimental study investigates the influence of fuel distribution on ignition outcome during high-altitude relight of a gas turbine. Planar laser-induced fluorescence is used to image fuel inside a lean direct-injection combustor under realistic conditions. A novel apparatus is developed to permit planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging, in which large quantities of poorly atomized fuel impinges on the internal surfaces of the combustor. Results reveal high variability in atomization quality. In the absence of flame, small droplets are confined to areas of recirculating flow, whereas large droplets impact on the walls. All fuel is introduced through a pilot air-blast atomizer close to the injector centerline. However, comparatively little fuel is apparent near the igniter tip because the outside swirlers of the fuel injector create a fast-moving stream of fuel-free air that flows directly below the upper combustor wall. The droplet size and fuel concentration in the main recirculation zone do not differ radically at test conditions with markedly different fuel-to-air ratios, suggesting that turbulent straining is a more important factor than equivalence ratio in the failure of ignition when the airflow rate is high. In the presence of flame, medium-sized burning droplets are observed close to the injector centerline. Flame interference resulting from fluorescence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is apparent, but small, suggesting that kerosene planar laser-induced fluorescence is a useful tool for the analysis of all stages of altitude relight.",29,4

The scramjet flowpath included a rectangular-to-elliptical shape transition inlet and a divergent elliptical combustion chamber, and the experiments replicated conditions for flight at Mach 8 and 32 km altitude. Two combustion chamber configurations were tested with the same overall length and area ratio, but with different lengths of constant area section before divergence. Injection of the hydrogen fuel was through portholes at the combustion chamber entrance. Both engine configurations underwent a significant change in operating character with increasing equivalence ratio that was consistent with a change from “supersonic” to “separated” combustion in a dual-mode scramjet. The configuration with longer constant area section changed mode at an equivalence ratio just less than one, with an abrupt increase in thrust. This was accompanied by a significant increase in the calculated fuel-based combustion efficiency from 25 to 72%. Mode change occurred at a significantly higher equivalence ratio for the combustor with shorter constant area section, indicating that small changes in combustor area distribution can have important effects on scramjet operability and performance.",29,4

Prior activity has demonstrated active control to suppress combustion instabilities with a conventional rich-front-end combustor. The current effort is developing further understanding of the problem specifically as applied to future lean-burning, very low-emissions aircraft engine combustors. A prototype low-emissions aircraft engine combustor with a combustion instability has been identified and previous work has characterized the combustor’s dynamic behavior. The combustor exhibits thermoacoustic instabilities related to increasing fuel flow that prevent full-power operation. Active combustion instability suppression using the adaptive sliding phasor average control method has been demonstrated experimentally with this combustor prototype in a combustion test cell operating at engine pressures, temperatures, and flows. A high-frequency fuel valve perturbed the combustor fuel flow. Successful instability suppression was shown using a dynamic pressure sensor in the combustor for controller feedback. Instability control was also shown with a pressure feedback sensor in the lower temperature region, upstream of the combustor. It was also demonstrated that the controller can prevent the instability from occurring while combustor operation was transitioning from a stable low-power condition to a normally unstable high-power condition, thus enabling the high-power condition.",29,4
