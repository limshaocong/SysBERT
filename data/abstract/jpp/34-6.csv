0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36442,"This paper mainly investigates the effect of circumferential nonuniform tip clearance on the performance of compressors. Initially, three-dimensional full-annulus simulations are implemented based on a transonic fan with several different nonuniform clearance configurations. Then, the performance response to the nonuniform clearance is assessed by steady-state computations. According to the uniform cases, an engineering method is developed to estimate the performance of nonuniform tip clearance. Finally, experiments are carried out based on a single-stage, low-speed axial compressor to verify the effectiveness of our evaluation method. Performance curves can be well estimated both in numerical and experimental investigations. The engineering estimation method is applicable for nonuniform clearance cases.",34,6
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36603,"A rotating detonation engine with two unique features, a wave generator and radial injection of fuel and oxidizer, has been designed and tested. The wave generator, consisting of a number of equidistant, circumferentially placed spark plugs, emitted phased sparks to produce free radicals in specified circumferential sequence. This prompted the detonation waves to spin in the specified direction. The detonation waves were initiated quickly, reached a self-sustained state, and maintained orderly spin for the duration of the test. The repeatability of the experiments enabled systematic studies of various controlling parameters, the characterization of orderly structure of detonation waves, and the clarification of the role of acoustic waves. In contrast, a single spark was found to induce two counter- rotating waves, which persisted for the entire experiment. The second feature, radial propellant injection from sparsely distributed holes, enabled the control of the mixing rate of fuel and oxidizer to regulate the axial location of detonation zones. Oblique shock waves emanating from the detonation wave fronts were found to reach the front-end wall, and the corresponding static pressure measurements found that the front-end wall pressure was insensitive to the variations in backpressure during stable rotating detonation engine operation, confirming the presence of supersonic axial exhaust flow.",34,6

This paper discusses the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic impact of the installation of a set of SRVs downstream of a single-rotating propeller. Experiments were carried out in a large low-speed wind tunnel, whereas simulations were performed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Favorable comparisons between the experimental and numerical slipstream data validated the simulations, which predicted a maximum propulsive-efficiency increase of 0.7% with the current design of the SRVs. This can be improved further by optimizing the pitch distribution of the SRVs. The upstream effect of the SRVs on the time-averaged propeller performance was negligible. Yet, small but systematic unsteady propeller loads were measured with a peak-to-peak amplitude of at most 2% of the time-averaged loading, occurring at a frequency corresponding to the five SRV passages during one revolution. The downstream interaction was one order of magnitude stronger, with unsteady loading on the SRVs with a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 20% of the time-averaged load. The interaction mechanisms caused an increase of the tonal noise levels of 3–7 dB, with the noise penalty decreasing with increasing propeller thrust setting.",34,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36939,"A novel diagnostic technique was applied to an ethylene-fueled supersonic combustion ramjet cavity to measure fuel scalar values, as a function of fueling strategy, before ignition. Imaging Fourier-transform absorption spectroscopy was employed to measure fuel concentration, temperature, and plume structure in the cavity and core supersonic flow. Additionally, a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer measured fuel concentration through extractive sampling from the base of the cavity as a point of validation. Two different fuel-injection locations were used and a range of fuel flow rates were investigated. Both diagnostic techniques showed similar trends in fuel concentrations within the cavity as a function of both fuel-injection flow rate and location. Furthermore, the unique combination of full spectral content and imaging of the imaging Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy allowed for fuel mole fraction and temperature estimates to be attained throughout the flowfield. Temperature maps indicated a strong sensitivity of cavity temperature on fueling strategy.",34,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36849,"Safe engine operation is ensured by setting safety limits on rotor airfoil-mounted strain gauges that monitor the dynamic response of the component. Traditionally, strain gauge limits are generated using geometry obtained from an “as-designed” nominal model, in which finite element analysis is used to compute the static and modal stresses. Predicted modal stresses of the cyclic analysis are used to optimize strain gauge locations to ensure modal observational coverage, modal identification, and maximum vibrational stress for each mode. Strain gauge limits are then produced for these optimal strain gauge locations on the tuned finite element model. This described nominal geometry based process is subject to errors associated with airfoil mode-shape variations caused by manufacturing deviations. This paper develops a new process based on as-manufactured geometry measurements from a high-fidelity optical geometry collection system that obtains more accurate strain gauge limits. It will be shown that, because of the variability of blade-to-blade geometry, strain gauge limits can vary significantly between blades. This will be demonstrated by analyzing a mistuned integrally bladed rotor on a sector-by-sector basis. The approach used in this paper has the capability to more accurately place gauges on responsive blades to ensure safe engine operation during testing.",34,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36888,"The phenomenology of unstart in a dual-mode ethylene-fueled scramjet is studied in the presence of inflow distortion using carefully calibrated unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations with an emphasis on understanding the large-scale transients over the length scale of the flowpath. The computational approach is validated with experimental data for two combustor operating states that bound the dual-mode and unstart conditions. Unstart is induced via an imposed fuel-staging transient that emulates the experiments. Inlet distortion introduces three-dimensional effects in the isolator, which primarily manifest in the nature of side wall separation and flow curvature; however, localized regions of heat release are shown to contribute to unstart-inducing side wall separation. A wall-pressure-based metric used to track shock-train motion in experiments is adapted to identify a period of constant shock-train speed and an incipient unstart condition. During the constant-velocity phase, separation on the upper wall modulates the supersonic core, resulting in a change from an oblique to a normal-like shock-train configuration. The incipient unstart state precedes the ejection of the shock train from the isolator, which is suggestive of a precursor to unstart. This metric highlights the importance of the side wall corner region during the unstart process and complements other studies of three-dimensional effects in similar isolator geometries.",34,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37031,"A simple physics-based model was developed for the prediction of shock-train location in constant-area scramjet isolators. The shock train was shown to manifest at the location within the isolator that possesses the Mach number required to match the isolator pressure ratio, the ratio of isolator exit pressure to inlet pressure. The model assumes that the Mach-number gradient along the isolator is due to boundary-layer growth. Using the normal-shock and quasi-one-dimensional isentropic-flow equations, a relation was derived for determining the location of the leading shock of the shock train. The model must be calibrated to obtain some measure of the boundary-layer thickness and growth. The model accuracy depends upon the amount of calibration data used. The model performed well using only the Mach-number-gradient information in a Mach 1.8 cold-flow direct-connect isolator, but not as well in a combusting Mach 2.2 direct-connect dual-mode scramjet tunnel. Improved performance of the model for both tunnels was achieved with the use of more calibration data. This simple model is useful for gaining physical insight into isolator dynamics and implementing closed-loop control schemes that seek to control the shock-train location in the isolator. Particularly, it demonstrates the importance of the isolator Mach-number gradient in determining the range of isolator pressure ratios the isolator can sustain.",34,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36978,"This study focuses on further understanding of the plateau burning mechanism of sandwiches containing a matrix of fine ammonium perchlorate (AP) particles and low/high-melt binder as affected by the type of the curing agent. Pure binder sandwiches and matrix sandwiches of various fine AP/binder ratios with two different curatives, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) and toluene diisocyanate (TDI), are considered. The burning rate versus middle lamina thickness curves are obtained to examine the interaction between the leading-edge flames (LEFs) anchored over the lamina interface edges. Pressure variation on matrix sandwich burning rates is considered in 1–12 MPa range. High-magnification combustion images and quenched surface features and profiles of these sandwiches are also examined. The IPDI-cured binder causes larger LEF standoff and inter-LEF distances in both pure binder and matrix sandwiches than the TDI-cured one. Consequently, the disparity in the burning rates with middle lamina thickness of IPDI-cured matrix sandwiches is minimal. The binder melt-layer thickness and its melt viscosity determine the flammability limits and midpressure extinction regimes of matrices depending upon the curative. Plateau burning trends of matrix sandwiches with large middle lamina thickness (greater than ) are observed to coincide with midpressure extinction of their corresponding matrices.",34,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36663,"Turbofan engines are connected to the airframe by a pylon that crosses the bypass duct downstream of the fan. The presence of the pylon generates a potential field that influences the upstream flowfield. Distortion generated by the pylon can be detrimental to the fan stability and integrity, and as such it must be controlled. This work presents a new method for the two-dimensional design of fan outlet guide vane cascades in the presence of the potential flow distortion caused by the pylon. The method, based on surface singularities, is capable of mitigating the distortion while preserving the performance of the nominal cascade. Design targets are achieved by manipulating both airfoil geometry and position within the cascade. Because the distortions caused by the pylon obey essentially inviscid fluid mechanics, the variation in load and loss parameters across the cascade can be approximated surprisingly well with a singularity method. The design rationale of controlling the incompressible load distribution leads to cascades with uniform load and loss even when viscous and compressible effects are considered using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics. The new approach provides a significant speed-up over methods based on computational fluid dynamics and is valuable as an initial design tool.",34,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36938,"A method is proposed for the aerodynamic design of nozzles with uniform outflow for supersonic and hypersonic ground-test facilities. This method involves the coupling of an open-source Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics solver, Eilmer, with the simplex optimization method of Nelder and Mead for the design of an expanding nozzle contour with the least variations in Mach number and flow angularity. Three nozzles were designed using this method to produce exit flows of Mach 4, Mach 7, and Mach 10. Numerical simulations of the flow in these optimized nozzle contours showed excellent flow uniformity in the core flow; typical Mach number variations were less than 0.5%, flow angularity variations were less than 0.05 deg, static temperature and flow velocity variations were less than 1%, and Pitot and static pressures variations were less than 2%. Experimental surveys of the Pitot pressures at several planes downstream of the exit of the three optimized nozzles showed excellent agreement with numerical simulations. The experimental measurements showed that there were good levels of uniformity in the core flow regions of all three nozzles, thus proving the validity of the proposed design method.",34,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37091,"Because of manufacturing variations, no real turbine blade exactly conforms to its nominal geometry. Even minimal deviations are known to affect aerodynamic performance, blade temperatures, and blade lifespan negatively. Rather than conventional deterministic design with its costly adherence to strict control of tolerance limits, robust design optimization aims to incorporate inevitable variations into the design process itself, so that both performance mean and scatter can be optimized simultaneously. Such a workflow is presented and applied in this paper to aerodynamically optimize an industrial turbine rotor blade against realistic manufacturing variations. A set of digitized three-dimensional laser scans from two turbofan engines forms the core of this study. On the basis of these deviations, the approach uses high-fidelity geometric models, nonintrusive uncertainty quantification, and efficient robust optimization with constraints to effectively locate Pareto-optimal designs. One selected robust blade is validated and shown to be desensitized to the observed manufacturing variability. The underlying measurement data are crucial to obtain realistic results and, as a consequence, are vital to design real robust turbine blades.",34,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37053,"Performance parameters of an electric discharge excited, supersonic flow CO laser operated with significant amounts of air species in the laser mixture is studied experimentally and by kinetic modeling. The results demonstrate that adding nitrogen to the CO–He mixture increases the laser power significantly, by up to a factor of 3. Adding oxygen reduces CO vibrational excitation and results in a steep laser power reduction. Adding air to the laser mixture also produces higher output power, such that the positive effect of nitrogen outweighs the negative effect of oxygen. This result indicates that a chemical CO laser, not dependent on the electric discharge for excitation, may be capable of operating in a mixture of carbon vapor and air. Performance of a supersonic flow chemical laser excited by a reaction of carbon vapor and molecular oxygen is analyzed by kinetic modeling. Peak laser power is predicted at the C vapor mole fraction of 0.2%, when 15% of energy stored in CO vibrational energy mode (4.5% of the reaction enthalpy) is converted to laser power. At higher C vapor mole fractions, flow temperature rise caused by exothermic reactions and by CO vibrational relaxation results in rapid reduction of the predicted laser power.",34,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36878,"A comprehensive linear acoustic analysis of the main combustion chamber of an oxidizer-rich staged combustion engine is presented. The theoretical basis is an acoustic wave equation derived from the conservation equations that characterize unsteady flow motions in the chamber. The physical model mimics the RD-170 main combustion chamber and includes all the geometric details, including the upstream flow distributor, oxidizer plenum, injector assembly, and main chamber. Damping effects associated with the flow distributor plate and injectors are accounted for by means of impedance boundary conditions. Acoustic communication between the main chamber and oxidizer manifold via the injector assembly is found to be significant. Acoustic waves excited in the main chamber propagate upstream and interact with the oxidizer dome, where they are partially damped by the flow distributor. The influence of baffle injectors on the chamber acoustic behavior is also studied. It is found that the largest contributor to damping is increased transport of acoustic energy out of the domain due to advective mean flow effects.",34,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36955,"The ignition delay requirement and ignition characteristics of a solid fuel in the ramjet combustor were investigated. The shock in a simple diffuser geometry was calculated to obtain the upper limit of ignition delay, and it was determined to be shorter than 1 s. To achieve this short ignition delay, a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) fuel grain coated with an ignition support material and a fuel-rich propellant (FRP) were prepared. The ignition support materials were nitrocellulose with boron potassium nitrate and an ammonium perchlorate (AP)/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-based composite propellant. For testing purposes, a compact gas generator was built to simulate the conditions in the ramjet combustor. The simulation results revealed that the ignition support material showed the shortest ignition delay of 1.27 s, but the flame in this case was not sufficient to ignite the HDPE. In a demonstration test, an ignition support material composed of and the AP/HTPB-based composite propellant was applied to the FRP fuel grain, in which case a stably sustained flame was obtained. The test results demonstrated that ignition of the FRP and that of the ignition support material occurred simultaneously with an ignition delay of 1.74 s.",34,6
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36909,"The Open National Combustion Code is applied to the simulation of a realistic combustor configuration (Energy Efficient Engine) in order to investigate the unsteady flowfields inside the combustor and around the first-stage stator of a high-pressure turbine. We consider (24 deg) of the full annular Energy Efficient Engine combustor with three different geometries of the combustor exit: one without the vane and two others with the vane set at different relative positions in relation to the fuel nozzle (clocking). Although it is common to take the exit flow profiles obtained by separately simulating the combustor and then feed as the inflow profile when modeling the high-pressure turbine, our studies show that the unsteady flowfields are influenced by the presence of the vane as well as clocking. More importantly, the characteristics (e.g., distribution and strength) of the high-temperature spots (i.e., hot streaks) appearing on the vane are significantly altered. This indicates the importance of simultaneously modeling both the combustor and the high-pressure turbine to understand the mechanics of the unsteady formulation of hot streaks.",34,6
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36826,"A computational model of a hybrid rocket motor has been developed for the purpose of simulation of internal ballistics and transient behavior such as combustion instabilities. The numerical model consists of four subcomponents: 1) a quasi-one-dimensional gas dynamics model using Euler equations for flowfield simulation, 2) a chemical model using CEA, 3) an analytical heat-feedback model for transfer of heat from flame to the solid fuel surface, and 4) a one-dimensional thermal conduction model inside the solid fuel. In the unsteady time-dependent simulation, it is seen that upon the application of a temporal boundary layer delay of the wall heat flux to the changes in the regression rate an unstable region ensues. At first, an oscillating periodic increase in the regression rate and chamber pressure is observed (linear regime), which then proceeds into a nonlinear limit cycle. A positive DC shift in the chamber pressure is also observed. The possible reason for the DC shift is explained with an analogy to a simple nonlinear oscillating system. The frequencies of different natural modes (including the intrinsic hybrid oscillation mode) predicted by the model are found to be in good agreement with theoretical prediction. The effect of finite time needed for the unburnt fuel to move from the regressing surface to the flame region is also additionally modeled using a time delay to the heat of combustion. This results in an increased amplitude of oscillations and a higher DC shift. Parametric analyses have been carried out with different boundary layer delays. The effect of the magnitude of boundary layer delay on the values of DC shift and RMS amplitude is also explained.",34,6
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36799,"The capability of a dual-manifold injector rocket engine scheme for deep throttling under extremely fuel-rich condition was demonstrated experimentally. The dynamic response of the rocket engine to throttling was analyzed as well. Under the extremely fuel-rich condition, the response of chamber pressure is sensitive to oxygen adjusting but insensitive to fuel adjusting. Response delay appears at the end of throttling, for both oxygen-adjusting cases and fuel-adjusting cases. The response delay mainly comes from the supply system for oxygen adjusting, whereas the response delay mainly results from the combustion process for fuel adjusting. The antiregulation, which means the chamber pressure variation is opposite to the throttling direction, occurs at the beginning of throttling. It can only be triggered by fuel adjusting, not by oxygen adjusting. It is found that fuel adjusting contributes to the antiregulation, whereas oxygen adjusting suppresses the antiregulation. Furthermore, the effects of oxygen adjusting and fuel adjusting on the antiregulation are positively related with their adjusting rate. The slow evaporation of liquid fuel under extremely fuel-rich condition is identified strongly with the response delay and the antiregulation. First, the evaporation time of liquid fuel is the main reason for response delay after the throttling process is terminated. Second, it is the interval between large amounts of heat absorption and large amounts of vapors released during the evaporation process of droplets that finally results in the antiregulation.",34,6
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37038,"Although significant advances have been made in simulations of rotating stall and surge with single passage or part-annulus passages models, quite little work has been devoted to three-dimensional unsteady full-annulus simulations of the aerodynamic instabilities. In this Paper, a hierarchical domain decomposition method coupled with an artificial interface method is proposed and applied to the full-annulus simulations of three-dimensional aerodynamic instabilities in NASA rotor 35 at low flow rates. The compressor–throttle valve model and compressor–plenum chamber model are adopted to consider the effects of pipe network system on the compressor. The parallel results fit both the serial results and experimental data well, and the parallel efficiency is around 84% with 432 processor cores. With compressor–throttle valve model, rotating stall is observed in that the unsteady performance path converges to a fixed point, and the rotating speed, number, and size of stall cells vary slightly from the stall inception to the developed stall. With the compressor–plenum chamber model, mild surge is observed in that the unsteady performance path converges to a limit cycle oscillation, and low-frequency and large-amplitude axisymmetric oscillations propagate periodically along the axial direction. The occurrence of rotating stall or surge is consistent with the well-established laws of parameter .",34,6
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36836,"Accurately quantifying mixture composition in supersonic flows is vital to the experimental development of fuel–air mixing enhancement strategies for scramjet propulsion applications. Mixture composition can be experimentally quantified by using either intrusive probe-based techniques or nonintrusive laser-based optical diagnostic techniques, with the different methods each offering unique advantages and disadvantages. To this end, the work presented herein provides a comparison of mixture composition measurements made with an intrusive gas-sampling probe to measurements of the same quantity made with the nonintrusive filtered Rayleigh scattering technique. The measurements are made downstream of a strut injector, which sonically injects helium parallel to a Mach 2.5 airflow, creating a two-dimensional planar shear layer composed of a binary mixture of helium and air. The experimental results show that the helium mole fraction measurements obtained using these two different techniques compare quite favorably. Specifically, at the primary downstream station of interest, all of the points surveyed with the gas-sampling probe lie within the 95% uncertainty bands of the filtered Rayleigh scattering measurements, with an average absolute difference in helium mole fraction of between the two techniques.",34,6
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36872,"This study addresses the use of a shrinking core model in order to evaluate the combustion behavior of boron pyrotechnic clusters suspended in a kerosene-based gel fuel. Boron particles are combined in a low-oxidizer pyrotechnic mixture forming clusters that are dispersed in the gel droplet. During the combustion of the gel droplet, the organic phase evaporates from the droplet surface, forming a porous layer of dry particles. The pyrotechnic clusters are designed to ignite after the formation of the dry layer, when boron particles are not bonded by any liquid phase and can be easily dispersed. It is established that the time needed to reach initial boron scattering depends on the droplet diameter and absorbed heat flux. No dependence of the time delay for initial boron scattering on the boiling temperature is observed. Three pyrotechnic mixtures are used in order to investigate the influence of the pyrotechnic activation temperature on the formation of the dry layer. Boron pyrotechnic dispersion based on ammonium perchlorate is limited to a low gel boiling temperature; whereas pyrotechnic dispersion based on or potassium perchlorate, which each have a higher activation temperature, can ensure the formation of a dry layer that allows scattering of the boron particles.",34,6
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37028,"The present Paper aims to present a comparative study of the external and internal flow characteristics through an axisymmetric circular convergent nozzle, a nonserpentine convergent nozzle with an elliptic exit, and a shallow single serpentine convergent nozzle with an elliptic exit under the fully expanded condition at a nozzle pressure ratio of 1.6. The static wall pressure measurements reveal that, due to the axisymmetric shape, the conventional circular nozzle shows symmetric jet development. However, the flow through the serpentine nozzle follows its curvature, making the flow through it asymmetric. The upper and the lower walls have different flow expansion due to the secondary flow created by the wall curvature and transition. This asymmetric nature of the flow through the serpentine nozzle also vectors the external jet toward the lower wall. The saddle-shaped velocity profile is observed along the major axis plane of serpentine nozzle. The nozzles with elliptic exits show higher mass entrainment and faster velocity decay as compared to the conventional circular nozzle. The nonserpentine elliptic nozzle shows the maximum velocity decay with the fastest decay rate among the three nozzles considered. This nozzle also shows the maximum mass entrainment across its major as well as minor axes and thus reduces the length of the external jet more effectively.",34,6
