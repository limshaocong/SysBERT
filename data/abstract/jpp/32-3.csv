In the previous study, a novel coaxial porous injector concept was developed to improve the mixing performance of a shear coaxial injector. It demonstrated a higher characteristic velocity efficiency than that of a typical shear coaxial injector. To clarify the efficiency-improving mechanism of a coaxial porous injector, the combustion flowfields of both injectors were visualized using a high-speed shadowgraph technique. The effect of geometry factors on the spray core length and the combustion performance as well as the differences in the reactive spray behavior between the coaxial porous injector and the shear coaxial injector were observed. The coaxial porous injector with a different wall-injection length showed higher characteristic velocity efficiencies, shorter spray core lengths, and thicker phase-change patterns at the spray core boundary. Changes in wall-injection length had a nonmonotonic effect on both the spray core length and the characteristic velocity efficiency. As opposed to the expected results, the coaxial porous injector with the highest combustion efficiency showed the longest spray core length. The phase-change pattern width, caused by the evaporation of liquid fuel droplets, was proportional to the efficiency.",32,3

The OH-PLIF images show instantaneous structures of turbulence in two combustor configurations at different fuel-equivalence ratios. Proper orthogonal decomposition and autocorrelations are performed on the OH-PLIF data to extract quantitative information about turbulent fluctuations and length-scale correlations. Changes in correlation length scales, representative of the integral length scales of the flow, and turbulent energy flow patterns are observed as a function of position in the combustor and fuel-equivalence ratio. Correlation length scales were found to increase with streamwise distance for all configurations. Dual-mode operation with supersonic and subsonic combustion is demonstrated in the facility. Correlation length scales and the growth rate of these length scales were found to be smaller in the subsonic combustion mode.",32,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35768,"Self-excited combustion instabilities of the first tangential mode have been found in a research combustor operated with the cryogenic propellant combination of hydrogen/oxygen. In a series of consecutive test campaigns, the influence of operating conditions on these self-excited combustion instabilities was examined. This included a variation of the combustion chamber pressure, the mixture ratio, and the propellant temperatures. It has been shown how these operating parameters influence the resonance frequencies of the combustion chamber. The analysis of the influence of operating conditions on the oscillation amplitude of the first tangential mode indicated that the instability occurred when the frequency of the first tangential mode of the combustion chamber was shifted into the frequency of the second longitudinal mode of the liquid oxygen injector. With a variation of the injector length, and therefore its longitudinal resonance frequencies, this hypothesis has been tested. Based on the experimental observations it was concluded that the observed instabilities were a result of the interaction of combustion chamber resonance frequencies with injector resonance frequencies. The heat release rate oscillation was shown to be a result of the injector acoustics and not of the combustion chamber pressure oscillations.",32,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35776,"Design and analysis of an atmospheric-breathing propulsion system to land large-scale spacecraft on Mars was performed. propulsion feasibility was analytically investigated by employing equilibrium combustion simulations, finite-rate kinetics simulations, and first-order propellant mass and inlet sizing. values (based on total propellant usage) were determined to be on the order of 120–160 s for onboard subsystems having a 10-to-1 oxidizer compression ratio. This corresponds to an of 600–800 s based on onboard fuel consumption. Although mixtures have significant ignition constraints, favorable conditions were found, yielding ignition delay times of less than 1 ms, by simultaneously employing designs exploiting both large reentry Mach numbers and modest compression ratios. These combinations allow for combustion to occur within moderately sized combustion chambers. The first-order sizing calculations confirmed that atmospheric-breathing supersonic retropropulsion has the potential for significant mass savings relative to traditional architectures. Designs with higher oxidizer-to-fuel ratios were more mass efficient. The largest benefit was seen for small inlet area vehicles that leveraged deceleration from a terminal instantaneous burn over higher thrust throughout the trajectory.",32,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35729,"Combustion instabilities in a liquid rocket engine are generated by coupling between the heat release oscillations and the acoustic pressure oscillations in the combustion chamber. These instabilities from the combustion chamber can affect the injector and the feed line, which are in front of the combustion chamber. These oscillation transfers could influence the combustion instability in liquid rocket engines. A properly designed injector can be used to prevent these transfers and suppress combustion instability. For this reason, the dynamic characteristics of the injectors must be studied. Open-type swirl injectors were designed to investigate the dynamic characteristics through experimental study. The injectors were designed with replaceable parts to change the swirl chamber length, swirl chamber diameter, tangential entry number, and manifold diameter. A hydrodynamic mechanical pulsator that produces pressure oscillations in the feed line was installed in front of the manifold of the open-type swirl injector. The pressure in the manifold, the liquid film thickness, and the pressure at the exit of the open-type swirl injector were measured to understand the dynamic characteristics of the open-type swirl injector. As a result, the open-type swirl injector’s response characteristics to pressure fluctuation inputs with different geometries were obtained. The tendencies of the output parameters acquired in the study could be used to adjust the injector design to suppress combustion instability in liquid rocket engines.",32,3

Although vertical-axis turbines do offer significant operational advantages, development has been hampered by the difficulty of modeling the aerodynamics involved, along with their rotating geometry. This paper presents results from a simulation of a baseline vertical-axis wind turbine computed using Star-CCM+, a commercial finite volume code, and compares them with data obtained from a multiple-streamtube model. Emphasis was placed on the dynamic stall characteristics and wake production, which have the greatest influence on turbine performance. A model was developed to replicate the blade–wake interactions common at higher tip-speed ratios and was found to greatly improve the accuracy of the blade-element momentum model.",32,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35438,"The self-recirculation-casing treatment is a widely used method to enhance the aerodynamic stability of a centrifugal compressor for turbocharging in internal combustion engine. This paper presents an investigation on the effects as well as the mechanism of the self-recirculation-casing treatment on the stability enhancement of a transonic centrifugal compressor with a vaneless diffuser by a numerical method. First, the experimental measurement is carried out on the compressor with/without the self-recirculation-casing treatment for performance comparison and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics validation. Next, the steady numerical method is applied to obtain the insights of the flowfield in the compressor with/without the self-recirculation-casing treatment. The results manifest that the stable flow range is evidently improved by the self-recirculation-casing treatment. The self-recirculation-casing treatment improves the stability of the compressor mainly due to three reasons: reduction of the blade loading, suction of the low-momentum flow near the shroud, and depression of the circumferential flow distortion in the impeller.",32,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35658,"The lack of onboard gas path measurements combined with the measurement errors leads the gas path analysis to an underdetermined problem with uncertainty. Incorporating additional information such as the domain knowledge and heuristics, as well as information derived from other diagnostic assessment methods, has become a promising consideration. In this paper, a Bayesian network-based multiple diagnostic information fusion mechanism is proposed to improve the performance of the gas path analysis. The domain knowledge and constraints regarding the component degradation pattern are incorporated into the network by setting an informative prior for the health parameters; furthermore, a fault mode prior probability table is developed to incorporate additional diagnostic information to narrow down the candidate faulty components to a possible set. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a simulation case study of a typical turbofan engine. As more information is incorporated into the network, the diagnostic result is improved. The faulty components can be successful isolated, and the fault magnitude can be identified with less uncertainty.",32,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35868,"A computational analysis of transverse acoustic instability is presented for an experimental combustion chamber with rectangular cross section. The analysis is shown to be efficient and accurate. The governing equations are solved on multiple, coupled grids, which are two-dimensional in the combustion chamber and nozzle and one-dimensional in the injector port. Thus, they allow for a fast simulation, even in a serial run. Because of the lengthscale difference, the jet flame behavior at the injectors (including effects of turbulence) can be decoupled from the acoustic effects and solved on a local grid for each jet flame emerging from an injector. Wave propagation through the injector feed ports is evaluated on additional, one-dimensional grids for each injector port. The overall algorithm is used to simulate the Purdue seven-injector rocket engine; good quantitative agreement between simulations and experiment is achieved. All simulations that are predicted to be unconditionally unstable are confirmed by the Purdue experiment. Small perturbations grow to a limit cycle for which the shape is a first transverse acoustic mode of the chamber. Only one result differs from experiment, albeit very slightly.",32,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35670,"Large-eddy simulation is performed to simulate high-frequency combustion instability in a single-element atmospheric combustor. Simulations are conducted for corresponding combustion-instability experiments, and the self-excited combustion instability is successfully captured. The first tangential mode of the combustion chamber is excited in the large-eddy simulation, and the amplitude and frequency of the pressure fluctuations are consistent with the experimental observations. The first tangential mode in the large-eddy simulation was observed at 1 kHz, and the peak-to-peak amplitude was approximately 4% of time-averaged pressure. The higher-order modes were also observed in the large-eddy simulation at frequencies ranging from 2 to 4 kHz, although those amplitudes were approximately one-fourth of the first tangential mode. The coupling mechanism between the flame and acoustic mode is explored based on the large-eddy-simulation results. The periodic ignition of the unburnt mixture exhibits lifted combustion in a pulsating motion, and the frequency is similar to the first-tangential-mode frequency. This unsteady pulsating-flame behavior is caused by the coupling between the fuel injection and the first-tangential-mode oscillation. The Rayleigh index indicates that a primary driving factor for the instability is the acoustically coupled pulsating-flame motion. The present results demonstrate that large-eddy simulation can accurately capture the unsteady heat release and its coupling with pressure oscillations. The large-eddy-simulation results clarify details of flame structures that are not completely understood from the experimental measurements. These results are also valuable for understanding the coupling mechanism of the flame and acoustic mode in a combustion chamber.",32,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35163,"A physics-based dynamic model of a twin-spool turboshaft engine that drives a variable pitch propeller is developed. The primary purpose for the development of this model is for researchers to use it to develop new engine control algorithms and study/predict off-design transient responses of gas turbine propulsion systems. In this model, the dynamics of the engine are defined to be the two spool speeds, and the control inputs are defined to be the fuel flow rate and the propeller pitch angle. Mockups of the turboshaft engine and the variable pitch propeller are developed using CAD software, and based on the mockups, a test stand for gas turbine engine static tests is developed. Experimental results are used to verify the dynamic model of the JetCat SPT5 turboshaft engine with a variable pitch propeller mounted on it. Based on experimental data, realistic performance maps of the engine components, including the high-pressure compressor, high- and low-pressure turbines, and variable pitch propeller are constructed and integrated in the model. The developed engine model is then validated with experimental results for various propeller pitch angles. The engine numerical model is implemented using MATLAB, and open-loop simulation results for large throttle commands are presented.",32,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35747,"A semi-inverse design optimization method for the film-cooling arrangement of high-pressure turbine first-stage vanes is initiated based on a combinatorial optimization algorithm, a one-dimensional heat conduction model, and computational fluid dynamics methods, in which inlet temperature distortion, radiation, and inlet swirl are all considered simultaneously. This semi-inverse design optimization method can optimize the total coolant amount of the film-cooling structure while ensuring an acceptable metal temperature distribution, which finally provides a scattered and nonuniform arrangement of the film-cooling holes and a minimal coolant amount. The optimization methodology is tested on the General Electric energy-efficient engine first-stage vane under a high thermal load, and the optimization result is verified by the conjugate heat transfer computational fluid dynamics simulations. As for the optimized cooling structure, a significant improvement of cooling performance is observed while the total coolant amount is slightly reduced compared with the prototype. It is also found that neglecting each of the three factors (inlet temperature distortion, radiation, and inlet swirl) could result in a significantly different film-cooling arrangement while maintaining the overall cooling performance, which highlights the capability of the semi-inverse design optimization method at various design conditions.",32,3

13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35815,"An energetic composite material based on graphene oxide and ammonium perchlorate was prepared using a recrystallization method involving acetone and ethyl acetate as the solvent and antisolvent, respectively. This method resulted in the production of small crystals, where the graphene oxide wraps around the ammonium perchlorate particle to form a composite particle. The resulting composite material is found to enhance the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate over just physically mixing. Furthermore, using this material, bimodal ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid propellants were prepared. The combustion behavior of the propellants were investigated, and the graphene-oxide-based solid propellant resulted in a 15% increase in the burning rate at a pressure of 80 atm over the baseline material.",32,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35887,"A quasi-one-dimensional model for scramjet combustor coupled with regenerative cooling has been developed for comprehensive and rapid prediction of engine performance in system design and further research of advanced scramjet engine cycles with regenerative cooling. The model consists of two sets of ordinary differential equations for the reacting flow in the combustor and the cooling flow in the cooling channels separately. Additional models for wall heat transfer, sonic fuel injection, mixing efficiency, and finite-rate chemistry are also included. The SUNDIALS code is used to solve the stiff ordinary differential equations for combustion flow and the nonstiff ones for coolant flow individually, which are thermally coupled and iteratively solved to obtain the variables of the flowfields and the performance of the combustor with the consideration of the effect of regenerative cooling. Examples of hydrogen cooled scramjets were simulated under Mach 7.7 with strut injectors. Compared to the combustor without regenerative cooling, the differences on ignition delay, mixing efficiency, and engine performance were observed in a regeneratively cooled scramjet.",32,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35819,"The present paper addresses the macroscopic atomization characteristics of liquid-fuel droplets when subjected to the influence of a high velocity air crossflow. A breakup model is conceived by using a set of correlations available in the literature with the purpose of replicating such phenomena. The computational results are compared against experimental data to validate the model. The results show a reasonable agreement between measurements and predictions in both the qualitative and quantitative outcomes evaluated, which sustain the mathematical formulation adopted. However, further improvements may be aspired to, given the fact that there is a lack of experimental data available when shearing effects come into play in the mechanisms occurring during the atomization process. On the other hand, the use of two fuels (diesel and biodiesel) allowed to perception of a relevant impact of the liquid properties (particularly surface tension and viscosity) in the characteristics of the fragments resulting from the breakup event.",32,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35914,"Recently, M. Murugesan and R. I. Sujith ( “ Combustion Noise is Scale-Free: Transition from Scale-Free to Order at the Onset of Thermoacoustic Instability ,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics , Vol.  32 , June 2015 , pp.  225 – 245 ) showed that the transition from combustion noise to thermoacoustic instability can be represented as a change from a scale-free to a regular structure in the topology of complex networks. These topological changes of the complex networks during this transition can be quantified by calculating the network properties. In this paper, the variation of network properties, namely, clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, network diameter, and global efficiency is presented as the system dynamics undergoes transition from combustion noise to thermoacoustic instability. These network properties capture the change in system dynamics well before the rise in pressure amplitude levels in the combustors. These network properties can be used as early warning signals to detect the onset of impending thermoacoustic instabilities.",32,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35916,"This study presents the results of analyses related to the effects of ambient air temperature (ranging from 5.2 to 23.9°C) on certain engine performance parameters and gaseous emissions, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. The data set used in the analyses was developed from gaseous-emission measurements of aircraft turbofan engines, during routine test-cell operations after overhauls. The engine focused on is the CFM56-7B26. Because the data were recorded in a continuous manner, all of the parameters have been characterized throughout the operations between idle to takeoff power. Two important parameters, combustion efficiency and specific fuel consumption, are also identified for all of the power settings, and are used to evaluate the effects of ambient air temperature on emissions. The results suggest that ambient air temperature is negatively correlated with thrust and pressure ratios, whereas it is positively correlated with exhaust-gas and combustor–inlet temperatures. In addition, the effects of ambient air temperature on thrust, combustor–inlet pressure, and overall and high-pressure compressor pressure ratios are higher at higher power settings than at lower power settings. Furthermore, the higher the ambient air temperature is, the higher are the combustion efficiency and specific fuel consumption, particularly at low power settings. At ground-idle power settings, the specific fuel consumption is found to be 41 and for above and below 14.0°C of ambient air temperature. The nitrogen oxides results are generally found to be lower than the International Civil Aviation Organization nitrogen oxides values, and the results point out, as anticipated, a tendency toward higher nitrogen oxides at higher ambient air temperatures. Carbon monoxide emissions at low power settings are found to be highly variable compared to those for the International Civil Aviation Organization values, due to the fact that the carbon monoxide emissions are strong functions of engine power at low power settings, and any difference in engine power leads to substantial differences in carbon monoxide emissions. Therefore, this difference is addressed to the difference in idle power assumption of the International Civil Aviation Organization. The effects of ambient air temperature on carbon monoxide emissions also suggest a negative correlation, particularly at low power settings, whereas it is not as discernible as with the nitrogen oxides emissions.",32,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35945,"A numerical solver able to describe a rocket engine cooling channel fed with supercritical methane is validated against experimental data coming from a test article conceived and tested by the Italian Aerospace Research Center. The multidimensional conjugate heat transfer model numerically solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for the coolant flow and the Fourier’s law of conduction for the heat transfer within the wall. In this study, an experimental test case is reproduced in detail in order to evaluate the influence of partially unknown parameters, such as surface roughness and wall thermal conductivity, and of operative parameter uncertainty, such as the coolant mass flow rate and input heat transfer rate. The comparison made with respect to the wall temperature and coolant pressure drop of the whole set of experimental data provides complementary information that allows better understanding of experiments and infers possible deviations from the expected behavior.",32,3
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35927,"The present work is aimed at providing an advanced understanding of the flow and loss mechanisms in an interturbine duct subject to the upstream wakes and swirl. This interturbine duct is representative of modern engines; it has an area ratio of 1.275, a mean rise angle of 28 deg, and an axial length-to-annulus height of 3.4. The experimental results, supplemented with computations, were made inside the annulus at a Reynolds number of 150,000. The flow structures within the interturbine duct were found to be dominated by the counter-rotating vortices and boundary-layer separation in both the casing and hub regions. The combination of the casing-directed radial pressure gradient at the casing’s first bend and the upstream low-momentum wakes caused a pronounced roll-up of casing boundary layer. It was believed that this casing boundary-layer roll-up separated under the influence of the strong casing adverse pressure gradient. A pair of counter-rotating vortices was also generated at the casing’s second bend by the combination of the hub-directed radial pressure gradient and the casing boundary-layer low-momentum core resulting from the first bend casing boundary-layer roll-up. The duct loss gradually increased at the first bend and rapidly increased at the second bend. A fair agreement between the numerical and experimental results was achieved regarding the flow and loss mechanisms in the interturbine duct with the consideration of upstream wakes and swirl at the duct inlet. However, numerical investigation on the complex flow in interturbine duct by the assumption of fully mixed-out condition at duct inlet cannot capture these flow phenomena and is most likely overpredicting the duct overall losses.",32,3
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35953,"A linear model is developed to relate the response of energy release rate per unit volume to velocity and pressure oscillations in a liquid-propellant rocket engine. Coaxial injection of fuel (outer flow) and oxygen (inner flow) is considered with chemical reaction in a thin flame and turbulent mixing as the controlling factor in an axisymmetric diffusion flame. The combustion process has a characteristic time for mixing, producing a time lag in the energy release rate relative to pressure. The model applies to an individual injector but can be used to couple the multipoint combustion processes and wave dynamics for a multi-injector chamber. In particular, the impacts of long-wavelength oscillations of pressure and velocity in the surrounding chamber gas on the mixing and burning rates are determined. The results are developed in a way that feedback to the chamber oscillations can be determined for either a computational analysis or a perturbation analysis of the chamber wave dynamics. Both the steady-state behavior and the unsteady linear perturbation for the coaxial jet are studied using an axisymmetric Green’s function. Flame temperature, flame shape, and burning rates are found as a function of mixture ratio and injector size (mixing time). The combustion response factor for oscillatory behavior is also determined.",32,3
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35954,"Nonlinear, transverse-mode, liquid-propellant-rocket-motor combustion instability is examined for the first time via a two-time-variable perturbation expansion in an amplitude parameter. Both triggered and spontaneous instability domains are studied. A specific coaxial multi-injector example demonstrates the matching process between wave dynamics and injection/combustion mechanisms. The combustion has a characteristic time for mixing, producing a time lag in the energy release rate relative to pressure. The coupled combustion process and wave dynamics are calculated for the first tangential mode. Two first-order ordinary differential equations are developed and solved for the amplitude and phase angle in the slow time. Limit cycles and transient behaviors are resolved. Nonlinear triggering is predicted in certain operational domains; above a critical initial amplitude, the amplitude grows; otherwise, it decays with time. A linear representation of the combustion process suffices to balance nonlinear nozzle damping. This perturbation approach provides better physical understanding than a computational fluid dynamics approach and allows lower-cost computation to determine trends over the key parameter domains. Moving a higher fraction of the propellant flow away from the chamber center has a destabilizing effect on the tangential mode. A most stable Mach-number value is deduced. The reduction to two governing ordinary differential equations benefits future optimization and control analyses.",32,3

The preexponential factor and activation energy are extracted as a function of product mass fraction. The extracted kinetic scheme does not assume multiple chemical steps to describe the complex response of energetic materials; instead, a set of multiple Arrhenius factors is constructed based on the local progress of the exothermic reaction.
