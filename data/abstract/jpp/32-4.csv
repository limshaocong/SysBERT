The lanthanum-doping effect on beta-zeolite catalysts was investigated through catalytic cracking of supercritical methylcyclohexane under the system pressure of 4.0 MPa and the mass flow rate of . For lanthanum/beta catalyst of the Cat-2 type, the gas yield of 28.3% and heat sink of could be achieved at the temperature of 700°C, much higher than those for the pure beta zeolite without lanthanum modification and for the thermal pyrolysis. Correspondingly, Cat-2 has a better performance on coking inhibition with the reduction of 56.2 and 29.5% at 700°C compared to beta zeolite and thermal cracking. Therefore, it was indicated that beta zeolite with the suitable lanthanum content, still maintaining its high activity and stability of the zeolite framework at high temperature due to lanthanum doping, had a great contribution to high heat sink and coking inhibition at high temperature.",32,4

This paper makes an assessment of modified T5 and T6 hollow cathodes for use as millinewton range thrusters. The influence of terminal parameters such as discharge current, mass flow rate, and cathode/anode geometry on thrust production is discussed. The data indicate that the T5 cathode may be able to develop specific impulses in the range of 150–250 s with argon at reasonable thrust efficiencies of up to 14%. As such, hollow-cathode thrusters may meet some limited applications. However, it is unlikely that this type of thruster could be improved significantly or could compete with similar thrusters in the same operating range. High specific impulse operation is also shown to develop large discharge voltage fluctuations, which may significantly limit the lifetime of such a device.",32,4

The sensor design is a direct measuring, non-nulling, cantilever beam arrangement. A multistep program tested the sensor through various facilities, culminating in simulated scramjet flight conditions. The first phase concerned calibrations for static, dynamic, pressure, thermal, and vibratory responses and electromagnetic interference. This phase concluded under Mach 3 conditions: stagnation temperatures and pressures of 300–655 K and 750–1000 kPa. Wall shear was measured as 132–248 Pa for skin friction coefficients 0.0010–0.0014. The measurements demonstrated agreement with flat-plate analytical estimations, numerical predictions, and historical test results. Total uncertainty was at 95% confidence. The second phase involved testing at Air Force scramjet facilities. Mach 2.0–2.2 flows were studied at stagnation pressures and temperatures (172–995 kPa and 294–1000 K). The sensors determined wall shear measurements (94–600 Pa) for skin friction coefficients (0.0016–0.0028). The sensors clearly indicated transient flow of a scramjet operability cycle with shock train movement and separation zones. The sensor demonstrated full functionality under sustained high-enthalpy flow conditions upward of .",32,4

Pressures tested ranged from atmospheric to 1194 kPa, and oxidizer injection velocities ranged from 35 to . Regression rates were determined using pretest and posttest length measurements of the solid fuel. Experimental results demonstrated that the regression rate of the porous axial-injection, end-burning hybrid was a function of the chamber pressure, as opposed to the oxidizer mass flux typical in conventional hybrids. Regression rates ranged from approximately at atmospheric pressure to at 1194 kPa. The analytical model was developed based on a standard ablative model modified to include oxidizer flow through the grain. The heat transfer from the flame was primarily modeled using an empirically determined flame coefficient that included all heat transfer mechanisms in one term. An exploratory flame model based on the granular diffusion flame model used for solid rocket motors was also adapted for comparison with the empirical flame coefficient. This model showed agreement with the experimental results, indicating that it has potential for giving insight into the flame structure in this motor configuration.",32,4

As a representative test bed, an Aerojet Rocketdyne T-140 Hall-effect thruster is operated at 3.05 kW and a xenon mass flow rate of with a vacuum facility operating neutral pressure of , corrected for xenon. Two electrical witness plates, representative of the facility chamber walls, are placed 2.3 m radially outward from thruster centerline and 4.3 m axially downstream from the thruster exit plane. The cathode is radially translated from 18.1 to 77.8 cm away from the thruster centerline. At each cathode position, the discharge current and the electrical waveform of the radial and axial plates are simultaneously measured. As the cathode radial position changes from 18.1 to 77.8 cm from the thruster centerline, the discharge-current oscillation frequency decreases between 17 and 35% for the electrically grounded thruster-body case, and between 15 and 23% for the electrically floating thruster-body case. The analysis of the electron current collected by the radial plate suggests that electrons directly sourced from the cathode impinge on the radial plate at large cathode positions. Overall, the results of this work show that the chamber walls act as an artificial electrical boundary condition that keeps the Hall-effect-thruster plume plasma potential to within certain bounds.",32,4

Understanding of the thermoacoustic interactions among heterogeneous arrays of swirl cups is important to enable the implementation of this low approach. This combustor has three stages: a high-swirl pilot stage, a low-swirl intermediate stage, and a low-swirl outer stage. Liquid jet A fuel is supplied to all three fuel stages, which is characteristic of the high-power operation mode. Four test conditions are examined in which thermoacoustic coupling is observed at a well-defined frequency. Phase-averaged images of the chemiluminescence emission show dramatic changes in the emission, which is dominated by recurrent weakening and reignition downstream of the low-stability intermediate and outer fuel stages. The pilot stage reaction zone also displays periodic variation in intensity that is 90 deg out of phase and precedes the intermediate and outer fuel stages. One operating condition results in pressure oscillation amplitude that is intermittently high and low. A new method using the proper orthogonal decomposition time coefficients is used to quantify the relative periodicity of the images. The nozzle design and the interactions between nozzle stages combine to allow significant thermoacoustic coupling in this burner under certain conditions.",32,4

However, the flame zone structure sensitivity to the addition of metal hydride has not been directly studied. This paper examines visible solid fuel flame height measurements and confirms these results with chemiluminescence in an optically accessible combustor. In addition, the fuel combustion performance is considered using a traditional hybrid rocket combustor as a comparison to the optical chamber results. This paper investigates dicyclopentadiene as the primary fuel binder in gaseous oxygen flow. is studied as a fuel additive and is compared to aluminum and mechanically activated aluminum-polytetrafluoroethylene. Twenty-five wt % increases the regression rate of dicyclopentadiene by 19% due to increased hydrogen release into the flame zone. Enhanced blowing from the 25 wt % decomposition increases the dicyclopentadiene flame height by 44%. decomposition is rapid with respect to dicyclopentadiene pyrolysis, and as a result particle size reduction from 100–200 to has no appreciable effect on the fuel regression or flame height.

7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35754,"An unsteady quasi-one-dimensional flow solver for simulating internal ballistics and axial acoustic fluctuations in solid rocket motors is presented in this paper. Higher-order numerical solutions of quasi-one-dimensional governing equations are prone to numerical oscillations due to the nonconservative form of the governing equations and the nonsmooth axial variations of the cross-sectional area. Adding artificial dissipation to a central scheme is found to be inadequate for suppression of such oscillations, and so a simple low dissipation shock-capturing scheme (named SLAU2) is used instead. The inherent numerical dissipation of this scheme is helpful in the proper capturing of steep-fronted acoustic waves (that develop at the onset of triggered instabilities) without undesirable numerical damping of the acoustic waves. Using the new solver, a procedure for computing characteristic frequencies, corresponding mode shapes, and damping rates is proposed and validated for a motor with a cylindrical grain geometry. The quasi-one-dimensional formulation can accommodate either slip or nonslip boundary conditions for axial velocity at grain boundaries and predict damping rates accordingly. The difference in decay rates obtained with these two boundary conditions is shown to be the flow turning contribution.",32,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35948,"The flowfield inside a rectangular-sectioned 90 deg bend was studied using laser Doppler velocimetry. The bend used in the present study was part of an auxiliary power unit for helicopter engines. The results showed strong tangential velocity gradients near the inlet of the 90 deg bend and reverse flow at the inlet corner near the top wall and the outer wall. Rapid mixing was observed as the flow traveled through the bend. Additionally, measurements were acquired at constant-theta planes with a high spatial resolution to better resolve the secondary flow structures. The geometric asymmetry in the circular-to-rectangular transition duct was measured, and the effect of this asymmetry on the downstream flowfield was characterized. Results showed that the asymmetry of the transition duct led to asymmetric flow through the bend. This was one of the few studies that showed how a small change in the upstream geometry yielded very different flow patterns, which were eventually mixed out by the exit of the bend, and thus provided some guidance on acceptable manufacturing tolerances.",32,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35709,"Mode transitions in a 6 kW laboratory Hall-effect thruster were induced by varying the magnetic field intensity while holding all other operating parameters constant. Ultrafast imaging, discharge current, and thrust measurements were used to characterize the change in discharge channel current density and thruster performance through mode transitions. The modes are described here as global oscillation mode and local oscillation mode. In global mode, the entire discharge channel is oscillating in unison and spokes are either absent or negligible with discharge current oscillation amplitude (root mean square) greater than 10% of the mean value and can even be as high as 100%. In local oscillation mode, perturbations in the discharge current density are seen to propagate in the direction. Spokes are localized oscillations that are typically 10–20% of the mean discharge current density value. The discharge current oscillation amplitude and mean values are significantly lower than global mode. The mode transitions changed with operating conditions, where the transition between global mode and local mode occurred at higher relative magnetic field strengths for higher mass flow rate or higher discharge voltage. The thrust was approximately constant through the mode transition, but the thrust-to-power ratio and anode efficiency decreased significantly in global mode. The peaks in thrust to power and anode efficiency typically occur near the transition point. Thruster performance maps should include variation in discharge current, discharge voltage, and magnetic field, known as maps, at different flow rates to identify transition regions throughout the life of a thruster. These results are used to calculate a transition surface for use by operators to keep the thruster operating in an optimal mode.",32,4

The formation of soot and gaseous aerosol precursors inside the combustor and during gas expansion in turbine stages and nozzles must be addressed before the real impact of aircraft engines with respect to particulate matter emissions can be assessed. To design strategies to reduce particulate matter emissions, the development of a zero-/one-dimensional gas-turbine model is proposed, taking into account combustor and postcombustor flow operating over the landing/takeoff cycles with a detailed kerosene jet-A1 kinetics scheme, including a soot-dynamics model. This approach is very efficient computationally and may be clearly satisfying for parametric studies or in a predesign step. First, the model’s predictive capacity for capturing the main features of gas-turbine combustion as well as the expansion of combustion products in the turbine and nozzle has appeared acceptable as concentrations of International Civil Aviation Organization standard emissions and sulfur-species conversion agree reasonably well with measurements, whatever the operating conditions. In particular, the results showed that and concentrations still exhibited variations in the postcombustor zone until exiting the engine nozzle. Using a revised surface-growth mechanism combined with the condensation of six major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has significantly improved predictions of computed particles diameters. Such values now agree very closely with experimental data collected over the landing/takeoff cycle, whereas the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as ethylene and benzene, were better predicted for the highest power setting (i.e., takeoff and climb configurations).",32,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35831,"This paper studies the dynamics induced by interactions of rotating blades and the surrounding casing in turbomachinery such as aeroengines. Also known as “blade/casing rub dynamics,” this phenomenon results in vibrations that contribute to fatigue failure, especially in blades. Recently, it was proposed that the underlying dynamics of these interactions is analogous to internal milling operations. This introduces the concept of chatter and its intrinsic time-delay component in the dynamics, which is known to invite some nontrivial instability characteristics. The present paper investigates how the structural properties of the blade and casing components influence the stability of the combined interaction. The cluster treatment of characteristic roots paradigm is used for a delay-dependent stability analysis in the space of the operational parameters. An in-depth analysis reveals important aspects of the stability, which may provide valuable tools for designers. Analytical expressions are derived to calculate the sensitivities of the stability boundaries with respect to certain structural parameters, for the first time in literature to the best knowledge of the authors. Interesting mathematical features of the sensitivity analysis method are also discussed, which can be exploited for improved computational efficiency. The devised theory is demonstrated in a numerical case study.",32,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35763,"High-frequency combustion instabilities result from a coupling between modes of heat release and chamber acoustics. Because the geometric dimensions of the chamber define the relevant acoustic modes, it is particularly difficult to study transverse instabilities in anything other than a full-scale chamber. In this paper, results from experimental studies of a two-dimensional subscale chamber that can nearly replicate full-scale acoustic modes are described. The acoustic modes are primarily driven by injector elements at the endwalls of the rectangular chamber. They were designed to be unstable, based on a vortex-shedding mechanism postulated on earlier results from longitudinal studies. The 27-cm-wide by 19-cm-long chamber produced transverse instabilities with a first width-mode frequency of about 2000 Hz, with no longitudinal mode content in the pressure signal. The chamber comprises a linear array of seven gas-centered swirl coaxial liquid injectors, designed to flow either bipropellants, only oxidizer, or nothing. Eight different flow configurations were tested, yielding peak-to-peak pressure oscillation amplitudes ranging from about 5% to nearly 100% of chamber pressure. The strongest instabilities were observed when endwall injectors flowed both fuel and oxidizer, and amplitudes were reduced as the driving injectors were moved inward. An asymmetric setup demonstrated that the unsteady pressures in warm regions and hot regions have differing pressure amplitudes. To demonstrate the potential use of the chamber for measuring the combustion response to velocity and pressure oscillations, the synchronized measurement and analysis of pressure and flame emission are presented.",32,4

Based on a ground-life test, a proper failure mechanism analysis was conducted, and the groove depth of the centerline accelerator grid aperture can be considered as the key lifetime metric. A nonstationary independent increment degradation model including both deterministic and stochastic parameters was proposed. The maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters was derived by incorporating the product-level degradation data and the component-level degradation data. A Bayesian method to update the stochastic parameters describing the individual ion thruster characteristics based on product-level degradation data was developed. Then, the remaining useful life and the mean time-to-failure can be estimated and updated once a new online performance measurement is obtained. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",32,4

The test engine has a nominal thrust level of 300 N, with nitrous oxide as oxidizer and polymethyl methacrylate as solid fuel. A total of 15 burns have been performed, at three different initial oxidizer mass flux levels: below, around, and above the range with a maximum tested mass flux higher than . No complete blowoff has been observed in the high-mass-flux regime; however, combustion instabilities and spontaneous engine operation shifting, leading to lower combustion efficiency, have been noticed. These phenomena have been analyzed and compared to the theoretical models available in open literature.

The research examines the option of condensing the combustion products, thus releasing the latent heat stored in the gaseous phase before they exit the engine and increasing the combustion efficiency. A two-step combustion process, using bypass air, was suggested to increase condensation. Three different models for the condensation of boron oxide were examined. The effect of bypass air injection on the condensation process was investigated, and the time required for complete condensation was estimated. The concentration of solid nuclei particles in the stream was found to have a major effect on the required time for the completion of boron oxide condensation; the more particles are present in the stream, the faster the condensation occurs.",32,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35818,"The development of future propulsion systems may rely on the extraction of power from high supersonic flows. In conventional supersonic turbines operating under such extreme flow conditions, the presence of blades induces important flow perturbations that result in severe aerodynamic losses and restrictions in the operating range, seriously affected by starting issues. These limitations present design opportunities for a bladeless turbine configuration. The present paper documents, for the first time in literature, an axial bladeless turbine concept, which is able to extract mechanical power from high supersonic flows through an annular channel. The tangential drag force exerted on the rotating inner and outer end-walls produces power, together with enhanced simplicity, coolability, and maintainability. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations allowed the detailed evaluation of the aerodynamic performance of the bladeless configuration. This unconventional axial turbine concept becomes a design choice for extracting power from supersonic flows, with minimum pressure losses.",32,4

Two experimental campaigns are considered in which gaseous oxygen is fed into axisymmetric hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene grains through an axial conical subsonic nozzle. A validation rebuilding of all of the firing tests has been performed first to highlight numerical prediction capabilities and modeling limits. Despite the several geometrical simplifications, which allows using a reduced number of cells in the computational domain and thus performing parametric analyses efficiently, the present computational fluid dynamics approach is able to capture the main features of the motor internal ballistics, fairly reproducing the average chamber pressure values and the fuel regression rate trends with oxidizer mass flux and port diameter. Computed flowfields show the establishment of a recirculation region at the motor head end, with a variable extension depending on the port diameter, which promotes propellant mixing and raises the fuel regression rate. Numerical simulations, supported by the experimental results, clarify the mechanism through which the port diameter has a direct influence on the fuel regression.",32,4

Hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation are used to investigate the influence of upstream internal geometry on jet flow and noise. The methods are validated using an isolated nozzle. The internal geometry is added by using approximated immersed boundary methods and body force methods, reducing grid complexity and cost. Installed coaxial nozzles, including an intake, wing, and flap, as well as (internally) the fan, outlet guide vanes, and other large features, are modeled. These large-scale multifidelity, multiphysics calculations are shown to reveal substantial new aeroacoustic insights into an installed aeroengine.

Data collected from an array of high-frequency-response pressure transducers measure time-resolved static pressure over the rotors at several loading conditions for three tip clearance heights. The influence of surrounding vane rows on the rotor tip leakage flow is investigated by adjusting the position of the vanes with respect to fixed sensor positions. One key result is that the wake from the upstream vane creates a modulation of the leakage flow. However, the upstream propagating potential field from the downstream vane row has no measureable impact on the leakage flow trajectory. In some cases, variations of the leakage flow trajectory angle due to these blade row interactions are greater than the differences due to a doubling of the rotor tip clearance height, an important finding not previously reported in the literature. Differences of the leakage flow trajectory trends with tip clearance are identified for a high loading condition compared to other operating points. Based on these observations, alternate methods are introduced for achieving collapsed leakage flow trajectories with changing tip clearance in two different flow ranges along the speed line.",32,4
