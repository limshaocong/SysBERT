0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37742,"This paper presents the use of a conventional computational-fluid-dynamics-based throughflow method to model the effects of a bypass fan in a propulsion system (for example, nacelle) under the restriction that information about the fan blade geometry is unavailable. Instead, the fan body-force model requires fan-performance data at different operating points as input. A simple implementation strategy is proposed to achieve this goal and extend the use of the body-force model to off-design operating conditions where fan-performance data are limited. This approach has been validated with axisymmetric calculations on three blade rows to demonstrate its capability at off-design conditions. The tool may be very useful to nacelle designers, who often have limited information about fan-performance data from engine suppliers.",36,5

One requirement of burn models is to supply a macroscale control volume with an energy release rate due to chemical reactions that reflects the subgrid physics of hotspot ignition and growth. Energy localization at hotspots delivers chemical energy at a rate , where is the heat of reaction and is a meso-scale energy localization time scale. This energy deposition rate is much larger than nominal Arrhenius-form chemical energy deposition rates in a homogeneous sample subjected to the same shock loading. To develop meso-informed energy deposition rate models, this paper identifies a meso-scale energy release time scale that is common to burn models based on the hotspot ignition and growth concept. The identification of a common time scale allows for a unified microstructure-aware, physics-based reactive burn model; high-fidelity meso-scale numerical simulations are used to construct a surrogate model for . The surrogate model is shown to capture the effects of microstructural parameters on and can be used for meso–macro coupling in a multiscale model to predict the sensitivity of HE materials.",36,5

The SPT-140 Hall thruster, similar in design to the SPT-100 thruster, which shows such sensitivity, was subjected to a series of tests to characterize the effects of background pressure on thruster performance over a discharge power range of 0.9–4.5 kW. Thrust sensitivity to pressure, in an absolute sense, was largest at 4.5 kW and decreased with power until there was little-to-no measurable effect at 0.9 kW. In a relative sense, thrust sensitivity was similar at all powers above 0.9 kW with about 2–4% higher thrust measured at than at the lowest operating pressure. Thruster magnetic field sensitivity, examined as a function of magnet current, did not have a strong dependence on facility pressure.",36,5

This research explains how to simultaneously measure the chamber pressure and observe the combustion dynamics in the consecutive pulse firing of the monomethylhydrazine and the mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide bipropellant thruster. This study investigated transient behaviors in the ignition and cutoff of the pulse firing mode of the thruster. There was a delay in measuring the chamber pressure for two reasons: the time needed for the propellant to fill the manifold, and the delay in the response time of the pressure-sensing system. The time needed to fill the manifold depends on the pulse number, whereas the response time of the system factor is constant. This paper also demonstrates that a fuel-rich injection in the pulse firing mode leading to explosive ignition can be realized by prompt evaporation of the oxidizer from the manifold.",36,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37606,"Aeroelastic instability in turbomachinery is one of the severe problems limiting its performance. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of stall flutter in compressors, which occurs when blades encounter large incidence flows. With the objective to understand the aerodynamics associated with stall flutter, the present experimental study is conducted on a subsonic annular compressor cascade. Five consecutive blades are oscillated, with the central blade instrumented for unsteady surface pressure measurements. The flow incidence is established using inlet guide vanes to provide three inflow profiles, representative of nominal, near-stall, and poststall incidences. With the blades oscillating at specific interblade phase angles and reduced frequencies, the stability of the cascade is determined globally and locally in terms of aerodynamic damping. The near-hub flow is distinctive due to the thickened boundary layer, resulting in an irregular variation of pressure with low magnitudes, eventually approaching negative stability. At larger incidences, due to the low-amplitude fluctuations in pressure at all spans, the overall stability is reduced. The present work also describes and rationalizes the nature of the dependence of blade unsteady pressure distribution on reduced frequency and incidence.",36,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37896,"Reported is a three-step procedure (also referred to as the observer) for fast and unbiased determination of the dominant frequencies and amplitude of thermoacoustic oscillations. The first step is to determine the rang of the dominant frequency by computing the amplitude at frequency bins uniformly distributed from the lowest possible frequency to the Nyquist frequency (i.e., one-half of the sampling frequency) with a strategically specified, widely spaced frequency-bin separation. The other steps are to refine the estimation. The frequency estimation becomes unbiased after step 2, and the error (or uncertainty) is insensitive to the signal-to-noise ratio. The computational complexity can be orders-of-magnitude lower than the discrete Fourier transform and the fast Fourier transform, and the accuracy is no longer limited by , where and refer to the sampling frequency and the data length, respectively. This Paper recommends that the frequencies and amplitude be estimated every two pressure cycles. Cycle-to-cycle (or short-term) variations in the frequencies and amplitude are well resolved for thermoacoustic oscillations in three different real devices exhibiting quasi-steady oscillations before the onset of combustion instabilities and spontaneous instabilities (i.e., linearly unstable oscillations) with different levels of nonlinearities, respectively.",36,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37800,"This paper presents the initial development and characterization of a novel micropropulsion system for nanosatellite applications: a liquid-fed pulsed plasma thruster (LF-PPT) comprising a Lorentz-force pulsed plasma accelerator (PPA) and a low-energy surface flashover (LESF) igniter. In this work, LESF was demonstrated as a sufficient means of igniting the primary discharge in a PPA operating with a pentaphenyl trimethyl trisiloxane dielectric liquid propellant, and initial characterization of the propulsion system parameters was performed. PPA current pulse durations of about with peaks of were observed, and plasma jet exhaust velocity was measured at using a time-of-flight technique via a set of double probes located along the jet’s path. Intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) photography was concurrently leveraged to visualize plasma dynamics and confirm successful operation in the LESF ignition regime. A peak thrust and impulse bit of and , respectively, were estimated using large-area Langmuir probe measurements of total ion flux produced by the thruster. This paper additionally exhibits successful operation of the LF-PPT with the hydroxylammonium-nitrate-based propellant AF-M315e. The results of this paper suggest the befitting of LESF igniters in LF-PPTs, and the compatibility of LF-PPTs with the green propellant AF-M315e.",36,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37866,"A generalized flat plate cascade model is developed in this study to predict the unsteady aerodynamics of a blade row with circumferentially nonuniform spacing in subsonic compressible flow. With no constraints on symmetry, this model can be applied to a blade row with any user-specified nonuniform blade spacing pattern. The effect of nonuniform blade spacing on compressor rotor forced response and aeroacoustic behavior is demonstrated by applying this model to case studies based on the geometry and flow conditions of the Purdue 3-Stage Axial Compressor. The results show that nonuniform blade spacing can greatly alter the blade unsteady loading and spread the acoustic energy to a broader frequency range.",36,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37846,"A new direct-connect supersonic combustor has been designed and tested for the study of plasma-assisted combustion in the ACT-II supersonic combustion tunnel. Laser-induced plasma ignition was investigated in an ethylene-fueled cavity flame holder at Mach 3. Combustor design, geometry, and flow characteristics are discussed in the first part of the paper. The supersonic combustor includes a cavity flame holder, where ethylene fuel is injected, mixed with entrained air, and ignited. Two injector configurations are included, one horizontal and one vertical, which were designed in such a way as to enhance the cavity flow recirculation. Two different plasma ignition mechanisms were considered: 1) a laser-induced plasma located at the center of the cavity, and 2) a spark plug placed on the bottom surface of the cavity. The diagnostics tools tested to characterize the flow include time-resolved pressure measurements, high-speed schlieren visualization and chemiluminescence visualization, and instantaneous planar laser-induced fluorescence of the CH radical. The second part of the paper discusses the results of the comparison between horizontal and vertical fuel injection. The larger backpressurization of the isolator and a more uniform distribution within the cavity suggest a greater heat release and combustion efficiency when the horizontal jet is used.",36,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37790,"Boron-containing coatings are actively used to improve the surface properties of mechanical parts of various devices and cutting tools. In this Paper, we demonstrate that deposition of boron-containing coatings by direct electron-beam evaporation of a boron target with a fore-vacuum plasma-cathode electron source can be used to substantially (by a factor of approximately 6–17) improve the lifetime of miniature (centimeter-sized), low-power (several watts), micronewton thrust level microcathode arc thrusters. Such improvement is a result of slowing down the interelectrode film degradation that occurs after numerous arc pulses. This improvement is observed after applying a hard (resistant to shock by plasma in a single pulse) sputter-resistant (able to maintain its protective properties for numerous pulses) boron coating on the interelectrode dielectric (alumina ceramic). This finding opens up a new way to improve the performance and lifetime of low-power vacuum-arc based propulsion devices for small satellites.",36,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37664,"Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) are gaining significant interest as a practical approach to increasing the operating efficiency of propulsion systems through pressure gain combustion. To use RDEs in practical gas turbines, their stability and performance with regard to hydrocarbon fuels need to be tested. Prior experimental work has shown that ethylene/air systems exhibit suppressed wave propagation, with speeds that are nearly half the ideal wave speeds. The purpose of this study is to simulate realistic RDE configurations that have been experimentally studied to gain insight into this wave suppression. Detailed numerical simulations using a reduced 8-species 2-step and a 21-species 38-step chemistry model are conducted. When ethylene is diluted with hydrogen, the system reaches a stable mode comparable to detonation propagation after unsteady transition period between a weak deflagrative and a stronger detonation mode. It is further shown that pure ethylene cases stay in the weak regime with weak pressure propagation aided by deflagration along the wave path. Species, temperature, and pressure profiles normal to the wave front show a weak pressure rise followed by a broad reaction zone. As a result, heat release is not confined to the near-shock region but is distributed across the detonation chamber.",36,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37805,"A novel fuel regression measurement technique was developed using a single-port, clear polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) grain and a high-resolution camera, providing temporally and spatially resolved data in a small-scale hybrid motor. By visualizing the fully illuminated port through a flat PMMA surface, the fuel grain diameter can be measured along the axial dimension. This paper provides the details of the implementation, data processing, validation, and results from 21 hotfires. A wide range of operating conditions were tested by varying the initial diameter, the fuel grain length, the oxidizer mass flow rate, and the precombustion chamber length. The main difficulty associated with this technique is correcting the data to account for the change in index of refraction of the solid PMMA as heat soaks into the material surrounding the port. Qualitative and quantitative data can be extracted to further improve our fundamental understanding of hybrid combustion and upgrade motor designs. This new regression method is nonintrusive, low cost, and easy to implement, and it has the potential to provide reliable space–time-dependent data for laboratory-scale motors.",36,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37832,"The performance of a diode laser igniter as a restart-capable device has been assessed for single-port, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/gaseous oxygen (GOX) hybrid motors. For this testing a prototype version of the igniter has been designed and implemented as a substitute to a traditional methane/GOX torch ignition system. Ignition tests have been conducted at atmospheric ambient conditions using an experimental single-port motor setup. Using three PMMA fuel grains, a total of 46 successful motor ignitions and restarts were achieved. These tests were conducted using a single multimode diode laser with an output power of 10.84 W and a nominal pulse length of 1 s. In addition, a total of 24 successful ignitions and restarts were demonstrated in a vacuum chamber with the same prototype igniter on a flight-scale PMMA/GOX motor under development for smallsat applications. The ignition transient is compared against baseline results from a torch ignition system for atmospheric tests, and the ignition delay performance is considered across all tests.",36,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37949,"In recent years, phosphor thermography has received increased attention as an alternative to other common temperature measurement techniques (e.g., thermocouples, pyrometry). This technique has been successfully used for surface temperature measurements on coated surfaces (e.g., turbine blades, furnace walls) and, in some cases, mixed with a reacting material. However, this technique has yet to be used for measuring the surface temperature of burning energetic materials (e.g., propellants, explosives). Adapting this technique to the study of energetic materials would enable temporally and spatially resolved surface temperature measurements that also lack some of the shortcomings of conventional methods. This work investigates the feasibility of using phosphor thermography to measure the surface temperature of burning nitrocellulose, an energetic material used extensively in single-, double-, and triple-base propellant formulations. Using phosphor thermography, two-dimensional time-resolved surface temperature measurements were obtained across the surface of a burning nitrocellulose pellet. The average surface temperatures measured with this approach were in good agreement with previously published measurements for nitrocellulose obtained with embedded thermocouples . This work demonstrates the viability of using phosphor thermography for measuring the surface temperature of burning solid propellants as well as other types of energetic material compositions.",36,5
