1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35086,"Recent commercial and government investments have resulted in substantial advances in the technology readiness of a number of new candidate “green” monopropellants, many of which have already completed, or will complete in the next few years, successful on-orbit demonstrations. These propellants are often touted as potential (and in some cases technology-level ready) replacements for conventional hydrazine. This paper presents a comprehensive, carefully considered set of screening criteria, against which will be evaluated a number of these emergent candidates alongside flight-proven propellants. Thereafter, a thorough assessment of both the performance advantages and disadvantages, as well as current states of the art (and technology readiness levels) for a number of these emerging green technologies as compared with each other and incumbent hydrazine flight systems are provided. Additional discussion is included addressing what it notionally means for a propellant to be green, how definitions vary throughout industry, and the relative importance of “greenness” to other performance, safety, and handling considerations. Finally, results of these studies are used to provide a candid assessment of what types of missions are either enabled by, or best suited to, the demonstrated properties of the green monopropellants vs established propellants, and where cost and risk factors favorably align for near-term infusion into specific missions (e.g., deep space missions requiring low freezing points, microsatellites with limited volume, and military and defense applications).",30,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34767,"The objective of this paper is to understand the observed changes in behavior of ammonium perchlorate deflagration characteristics reported in literature, when it is doped with potassium. Successive recrystallization is employed to dope potassium into ammonium perchlorate. This paper, through various recrystallization techniques, conclusively puts an end to doubts regarding the actual process of acquisition of potassium by ammonium perchlorate. It is concluded that the increase in the potassium content in ammonium perchlorate is due to the filter used during recrystallization process. From the experiments conducted to obtain the deflagration rates of ammonium perchlorate, it is observed that potassium doped ammonium perchlorate has higher burning rates and also a higher low-pressure deflagration limit. As potassium doped is within the ammonium perchlorate crystal, thermal conductivity and specific heat values for ammonium perchlorate with various percentages of potassium are obtained. These values are incorporated into the computational studies on ammonium perchlorate. The computational studies performed in this paper are not intended to reproduce the experimental results but to illustrate the various features of the potassium doped ammonium perchlorate deflagration. With these computational studies, the observed burning rate increase and low-pressure deflagration limit increase of ammonium perchlorate with doped potassium are explained.",30,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34909,"Different boron-based fuel-rich propellants were prepared by replacing part of ammonium perchlorate with different content of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine, cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine, potassium nitrate, and potassium perchlorate. The burning rate of the propellants under different pressures was measured in the strand burner, the combustion temperature of the propellants under 1 MPa was measured by microthermocouple, and differential scanning calorimetry/thermogravimetric analysis experiments of the propellants in argon atmosphere were carried out. The experimental results show that the effect of each oxidizer on the burning rate of the propellant is different; cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine could increase the combustion temperature and the gaseous products, whereas potassium nitrate, and potassium perchlorate have the opposite effect. The composition of the combustion products under different pressures was calculated based on the minimization of Gibbs free-energy principle, and the results indicate that, although cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine could decrease the content of boron carbide in the combustion products, cyclotetramethylenetetranitramine and cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine have a lower effect on the heat release of boron because more boron nitride is produced during the combustion process; potassium perchlorate could decrease the content of boron nitride in the combustion products, obviously.",30,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34950,"Single drop studies have shown that there are significant differences in the way liquid hydrocarbons containing additives burn, compared with neat fuels. An experimental study was performed to evaluate how this change in burning behavior might affect the stability behavior of a model rocket combustor. Ammonia borane was investigated as a potential additive using a continuously variable resonance combustor, which has been shown to generate self-excited instabilities. The neat fuel was ethanol. High-speed imaging was used to obtain approximate heat release and boron oxidation profiles near the injector. Whereas neat ethanol exhibited only one mode of unsteady heat addition, it was found that the addition of the ammonia borane resulted in a bimodal temporal and spatial unsteady heat addition. This bimodal behavior produced combustion dynamics that allowed the system to be unstable over a wider range of geometric configurations.",30,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34959,"This paper describes the experimental characterization of catalysts manufactured with a novel method, omitting the need for the complicated and time consuming wash-coating procedure. The catalysts have been shown to be able to decompose highly concentrated solutions of hydrogen peroxide in operating conditions representative of a thruster for spacecraft attitude control and orbital maneuvers. The catalysts are based on a ceramic honeycomb support in yttria-stabilized zirconia, with manganese oxides as the active phase. Three catalysts, prepared by different in-house developed procedures, have been tested in a decomposition chamber, operating with a 87.5 wt % hydrogen peroxide solution. Test results have demonstrated decomposition efficiencies close to 100% and response times in the range of seconds. Additional tests have been performed on the most promising sample, to identify the maximum amount of hydrogen peroxide that can be decomposed before recording a strong drop in catalyst performance.",30,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34996,"Novel bulk catalysts based on CoMn mixed oxides were prepared by a coprecipitation method for rocket-grade hydrogen peroxide decomposition. A 2 N thruster was used to evaluate and compare the catalysts in continuous and pulsed firings. The aluminum-containing mixed oxide catalyst, CoMnAl, provided the best performance, spontaneously decomposing the propellant and sustaining several thermal cycles without fractures and deactivation. Because experimental results were close to theoretical ones, this material has a good potential for peroxide decomposition in satellite and auxiliary propulsion systems.",30,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34997,"Surface roughness and radiation effects on the erosion behavior of a graphite nozzle are studied for both metallized and nonmetallized propellants. A validated numerical approach that relies on a full Navier–Stokes flow solver coupled with a thermochemical ablation model is used for the analysis. A modification of the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model is implemented to account for surface roughness. Net radiative heat flux is considered in the surface energy balance at the nozzle interface. Two different simplified models are used to evaluate the integral emissivity of dispersed alumina particles. Individual and combined effects of roughness and radiation are analyzed. Surface roughness enhances the erosion rate for both metallized and nonmetallized propellants noticeably. The radiation influences the erosion rate of nonmetallized propellant more than the metallized one, mainly due to the different erosion regimes, kinetically controlled for the former and diffusion controlled for the latter.",30,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34924,"A closed-loop throttle controller for a laboratory-scale and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene hybrid rocket motor is presented. Closed-loop throttling was achieved using commercial off-the-shelf valve hardware and a commercially available motor case adapted for hybrid rocket testing. Multiple and open- and closed-loop tests were performed to demonstrate that closed-loop control can significantly reduce the run-to-run burn variability typical of hybrid rocket motors. Closed-loop proportional/integral control algorithms featuring thrust or pressure feedback were used to track prescribed step and linear ramp profiles. Because the relationship between the selected throttle control valve position and the effective valve flow area was highly nonlinear, the effect of valve position on motor thrust/chamber pressure was measured open loop and curve fit to allow direct command of either total thrust or chamber pressure. Control law gains were tuned a priori using a numerical model and then adjusted using the actual test hardware. Response profiles were optimized according the integral absolute error criterion. Control law tuning examples are presented. Test results indicate that, to a 95% confidence level, closed-loop throttling significantly reduces the mean run-to-run thrust variability from to less than . When effects of nozzle erosion are accounted for, the closed-loop thrust variability reduces to .",30,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34979,"Testing has been conducted with the BKH rocket combustor at the European Research and Technology Test Facility P8 for cryogenic rocket engines at DLR Lampoldshausen. BKH has multiple shear coaxial injectors and an exhaust modulation system for forcing excitation of acoustic resonances in the combustion chamber. Optical access windows allow the application of parallel high-speed shadowgraph and flame emission imaging of the near-injector region. This paper reports measurements of the intact liquid oxygen core during forced excitation of the first transverse acoustic mode. High-speed shadowgraph images show that the mechanism of core breakup and atomization differs between off-resonance and first transverse excitation conditions. The core length is found to decrease with increasing amplitude of acoustic pressure, or equivalently with transverse acoustic velocity, with a core length reduction of up to 70% for conditions approaching those of naturally occurring high frequency combustion instabilities. This dependence is shown to be distinguishable for differing operating conditions of the combustor. Fluctuation in core length also decreases with increasing excitation amplitude. Knowledge of the influence of the transverse acoustic field on the LOx core is important for understanding the driving mechanisms of combustion instabilities.",30,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34831,"Temperature and concentration distributions of a horizontal section through a simulated stationary test flame were reconstructed with the help of computer tomography. The study uses temperature and concentration distributions equal to published time-averaged data for the Sandia D flame. Projection values are obtained by simulated line-of-sight integration for two water vapor absorption lines in the range, where direct absorption spectroscopy and wavelength modulation spectroscopy with second harmonic frequency detection are considered. The projected values obtained from line-of-sight measurements are deconvoluted by tomographic methods, where Abel inversion and filtered backprojection are investigated. The tomographic reconstruction yields spatially resolved spectroscopic data, which is then used to calculate distributions for temperature and concentrations. Results illustrate that tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy artifacts are caused by relatively small errors in reconstructed spectroscopy data. In regions with low-signal magnitudes, tomographic errors are amplified when temperature and concentrations are calculated using two-line ratio thermometry. Although this study indicates that the selection of absorption lines has an impact on the quality of tomographic reconstructions, results nevertheless show that second harmonic frequency detection, in conjunction with tomography, is a viable method to reconstruct spatially resolved temperature and concentration distributions for stationary flames.",30,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34855,"The coupled hot gas–wall–coolant environment that occurs in regeneratively cooled liquid rocket engines is studied by a computational procedure able to provide a quick and reliable prediction of thrust chamber wall temperature and heat flux as well as coolant flow characteristics, like pressure drop and temperature gain in the regenerative circuit. The coupled analysis is performed by means of a computational fluid dynamics solver of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for the hot gas flow and by a simplified quasi-two-dimensional approach, which widely relies on semiempirical relations, for the coolant flow and wall structure heat transfer in the cooling channels. Coupled computations of the space shuttle main engine main combustion chamber are performed and compared with available literature data. Results show a reasonable agreement in terms of coolant pressure drop and temperature gain with nominal data, whereas the computed wall temperature peak is closer to hot-firing test data than to the nominal value.",30,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34832,"The aim of this work is to study the fluid hammer and related multiphase phenomena taking place in a confined environment, where pressurized liquid faces vacuum conditions after opening an isolation valve. This paper describes the experimental facility built for this purpose, the tests performed, and shows the comparison with the numerical results obtained with a transient one-dimensional software based upon conservation equations. Because the multiphase phenomena taking place in the liquid front moving along the pipe are complex and difficult to interpret, a graphical tool by means of diagrams was adapted by the authors to characterize the physical phenomena involved. Contrary to the classical water hammer analysis published in the literature so far, the diagrams allow a simultaneous study in time and space for each of the magnitudes involved in the evolution of the fluid hammer.",30,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34913,"Pressure gain combustion has been the subject of scientific study for over a century due to its promise of improved thermodynamic efficiency. In many recent application concepts, pressure gain combustion is used as a component in an otherwise continuous, normally steady flow system, such as a gas turbine or ramjet engine. However, pressure gain combustion is inherently unsteady. Failure to account for the effects of this periodic unsteadiness can lead to misunderstanding and errors in some performance calculations. This paper clarifies the accounting by presenting a consistent method of thermodynamic cycle analysis for a device using pressure gain combustion technology. The incorporation of the unsteady pressure gain combustion process into the conservation equations for a continuous flow device is presented. Most important, the appropriate method for computing the conservation of momentum is presented. It will be shown that proper, consistent analysis of cyclic conservation principles produces more realistic performance predictions. Specifically, for the ramjet example used, appropriate predictions of both the thermal efficiency (from energy conservation) and specific thrust (from momentum conservation) are developed.",30,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34986,"A large-eddy simulation is conducted to investigate the transient structure of an unstable detonation wave in two dimensions and the evolution of intrinsic hydrodynamic instabilities. The dependency of the detonation structure on the grid resolution is investigated, and the structures obtained by large-eddy simulation are compared with the predictions from solving the Euler and Navier–Stokes equations directly. The results indicate that to predict irregular detonation structures in agreement with experimental observations the vorticity generation and dissipation in small scale structures should be taken into account. Thus, large-eddy simulation with high grid resolution is required. In a low grid resolution scenario, in which numerical diffusion dominates, the structures obtained by solving the Euler or Navier–Stokes equations and large-eddy simulation are qualitatively similar. When high grid resolution is employed, the detonation structures obtained by solving the Euler or Navier–Stokes equations directly are roughly similar yet equally in disagreement with the experimental results. For high grid resolution, only the large-eddy simulation predicts detonation substructures correctly, a fact that is attributed to the increased dissipation provided by the subgrid scale model. Specific to the investigated configuration, major differences are observed in the occurrence of unreacted gas pockets in the high-resolution Euler and Navier–Stokes computations, which appear to be fully combusted when large-eddy simulation is employed.",30,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34631,"The effect of small mistuning in the forced response of a bladed disk is analyzed using a recently introduced methodology: the asymptotic mistuning model. The asymptotic mistuning model is an extremely reduced, simplified model that is derived directly from the full formulation of the mistuned bladed disk using a consistent perturbative procedure based on the relative smallness of the mistuning distortion. A detailed description of the derivation of the asymptotic mistuning model for a realistic bladed disk configuration is presented. The asymptotic mistuning model results for several different mistuning patterns and forcing conditions are compared with those from a high-resolution finite element model. The asymptotic mistuning model produces quantitatively accurate results, and, probably more relevant, it gives precise information about the factors (tuned modes and components of the mistuning pattern) that actually play a role in the vibrational forced response of mistuned bladed disks.",30,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34742,"Proper boundary conditions are required to accurately compute any flowfield. Although compressor designs are accomplished in large part with computational fluid dynamics tools, confidence in these tools exists because of code validation using high-quality experimental datasets. It has been widely recognized that inlet distortion has an impact on compressor performance. However, the impact of small distortion in inlet total pressure and total temperature profiles, as found in a research facility, on compressor performance predictions has not been well documented. In this paper, the inlet flow conditions for a multistage research compressor are shown. Compressor performance calculations using the measured inlet conditions are compared with results obtained with different inlet conditions to determine the sensitivity of the calculated multistage compressor performance to these conditions. Effects of radial profiles, endwall boundary-layer thickness, and circumferential nonuniformity are considered.",30,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34765,"Experiments have been performed in a three-stage axial compressor to investigate unsteady stator boundary-layer transition in an embedded stage environment. Quasi-wall shear stress data have been acquired on the suction surface of the second stage stator, in addition to unsteady flow angle measurements at the stator inlet. With two rotor blade rows upstream of the instrumented stator, blade row interactions representative of a multistage environment are present. The different blade counts for the upstream rotors provide an unsteady flowfield at the stator inlet featuring a beating pattern. There is no portion of fully laminar boundary-layer flow on this vane. The vane boundary layer is transitional near the leading edge, and transition to a fully turbulent boundary layer is complete by 45% suction side length. The presence of the rotor 1 wakes, when arriving in between the rotor 2 wakes, increases the normalized quasi-wall shear stress in the leading-edge region by 4% and decreases the amount of laminar transitional flow.",30,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34716,"The combustion field downstream of a 10 deg compression ramp injector has been studied experimentally using wall static pressure measurement, OH planar laser-induced fluorescence, and 2 kHz intensified video filtered at 320 nm for OH emission. Nominal test section entrance conditions were Mach 2, 131 kPa static pressure, and 756 K stagnation temperature. The experiment was equipped with a variable-length inlet duct that facilitated varying the boundary-layer development length for nearly constant injector shock structure conditions. By varying the boundary-layer thickness from 40% of the ramp height to 150% of the ramp height, changes in the combustion flowfield downstream of the injector could be diagnosed. It was found that flame shape changed, the persistence of the vortex cores was reduced, and combustion efficiency rose as the incident boundary layer grew. Unsteadiness within the flameholding region also varied greatly over the range of conditions studied, and largest unsteadiness was observed at intermediate boundary-layer heights.",30,2
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34763,"Achieving efficient ignition and stable combustion in a high-speed environment has long been a serious concern in the development of scramjet engines. In the engine startup stage, the low chamber pressure and unsettled fuel–air mixing tend to blow off the flame, even if a flameholding device such as a cavity is employed. The problem may be circumvented by modulating the flow structures in the isolator and combustor through air throttling downstream of the flameholder. In experiments, compressed air is introduced in a controlled manner into the combustor to generate a precombustion shock train in the isolator. The resultant increases in the temperature and pressure of the airstream in the combustor, along with the decrease in the flow velocity, lead to smooth and reliable ignition. The incidentally formed separated flows adjacent to the combustor sidewall improve fuel–air mixing as a result of enhanced flow distortion and increased residence time. Because insufficient reaction heat release often leads to an unstable shock train, and exceedingly large heat release may cause severe flow spillage or even inlet unstart, dynamic optimization of the throttling operation is needed to ensure the creation of flow conditions conducive to efficient ignition. The present work establishes an integrated theoretical/numerical framework, within which the influences of all known effects on the engine ignition transient and flame development are studied systematically. Part 1 of the study focuses on nonreacting flow development and fuel–air mixing under the influence of air throttling.",30,2
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34892,"Combustor–inlet interactions in ramjet engines are associated with such critical operation processes as combustion mode (ramjet mode/scramjet mode) transition and the onset of inlet unstart. Previous studies showed these critical operational processes were characterized by a nonlinear hysteresis property that originated from flow instabilities. This paper describes in detail, discusses, and comes to the conclusion that the complex hysteresis phenomena that are exhibited during the combustor–inlet interaction in a ramjet engine are governed by a certain mathematical rule: the butterfly geometry in Thom’s classification theorem. This conclusion is proved analytically under the assumption of inviscid flow. It shows the bifurcation set of a ramjet engine is a butterfly-shaped geometry. The butterfly geometry is higher in dimension than the formerly found cusp geometry, and it rules the hysteresis behaviors that are exhibited during combustion mode transition and inlet start/unstart, respectively. The formerly found cusp geometry is a local geometry of butterfly geometry. This invariance geometry rule offers not only an explanation of the known hysteresis behaviors but also a way of predicting the unknown hysteresis behaviors that are exhibited during combustor–inlet interaction in a ramjet engine. The hysteresis property introduces complex route-dependent behaviors to ramjet engines, and it is therefore necessary to have a global picture of various hysteresis phenomena for further understanding of the control problems of ramjet engines.",30,2
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34992,"The description of combustion in high-speed turbulent flows, where turbulent mixing, compressibility effects, and chemical kinetics processes are competing, still remains a challenging issue for numerical simulations. The key features of such turbulent supersonic reactive flows are integrated into a turbulence–chemistry interaction closure, which relies on the partially stirred reactor framework. The corresponding closure, hereafter denoted as the unsteady partially stirred reactor model, is incorporated into the ONERA computational fluid dynamics code CEDRE. The computational model is used to investigate a Mach 12 rectangular-to-elliptical-shape-transition scramjet engine developed and operated at the University of Queensland. Results of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes numerical simulations based on either the unsteady partially stirred reactor concept or the classical quasi-laminar closure are presented and compared. Similar results in terms of pressure distributions are obtained, thus confirming that the essential point to cope with such scramjet engine conditions is to represent satisfactorily the compressible flowfield. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes numerical simulations are subsequently used to investigate the engine performance, through the calculation of energetic efficiencies. The obtained results bring useful insights into the classical quasi-one-dimensional performance analyses. In particular, the inlet injection scheme is found to display the best performance with a combustion efficiency of 78%.",30,2
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34994,"Three-dimensional turbulent simulations with combustion modeling are employed to understand fundamental phenomena encountered in the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation Flight 2 scramjet flowpath. Experimental data from the ground-test campaign as well as a grid resolution study are used to validate the results of the simulations. These confirmed results are then leveraged to explain the physics of dual- and scramjet-mode operation in a steady sense, including detailed examinations of shock structure, boundary-layer separation, and combustion chemistry. Simulations of the flight and ground tests are compared in order to characterize the effects of the inlet on the boundary-layer development and internal shock structures. Overall, agreement with ground-test data is excellent, and the simulations show highly complex three-dimensional structures in the flowpath. Boundary-layer separation induced shock–boundary-layer interactions dominate dual-mode operation, whereas at higher Mach numbers a flameholding effect of the barrel shock from fuel injection is striking. The effects of the inlet are found to be of great importance to accurately model flight tests; however, the same macroscale effects as observed in the ground-test simulations are dominant. These steady simulations set the stage for future transient simulations focusing on mode-transition and unstart.",30,2
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34843,"This paper describes the conceptual design of three all-electric powerplants—a battery-only, a fuel-cell-only, and a battery–fuel cell hybrid powerplant—for a manned ultralight utility helicopter (Robinson R 22 Beta II-like) and carries out a comparative evaluation of performance delivered by each. The new powerplants consist of a combination of high-pressure proton exchange membrane fuel cells, 700 bar type-4 hydrogen storage, a compressor–expander, lithium-ion batteries, and an alternating current synchronous permanent magnet motor. The key conclusion is that a hybrid powerplant that combines high specific power of batteries in hover and high calorific value of hydrogen in cruise delivers a superior performance compared to either system alone. The efficiency is higher than current rotorcraft piston engines but the key limitation is its low specific power, which is half of the current engines. Only 60% of the original payload can be flown (90 kg solo pilot) for a duration of 35 min (including 11 min hover) over a range of 47 km under high/hot conditions. The paper lays the foundations of performance analysis for all-electric rotorcraft, benchmarks the best performance achievable with current state of the art, and quantifies future technology targets to enable performance comparable to existing internal combustion engines.",30,2
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34980,"The T-220HT Hall-effect thruster was tested with the external cathode at different azimuthal locations to determine the effect of an external cathode on the far-field plume. The cathode is mounted in two configurations: 1) on top of the thruster, perpendicular to the plane of plume measurements, and 2) in the plane of plume measurements. The thruster was tested at discharge voltages of 150–300 V at a constant discharge current of 9 A on krypton propellant. The vacuum facility operating pressure was below for all operating conditions. Noticeable changes in the plume ion current density were measured that indicate plume asymmetry. With the cathode in the plane of the probes, the ion current density peak increases by up to 43% and the divergence angle decreases by up to 2.6 deg. However, there is less than a 5 V shift in the ion energy distribution, and the distribution shape remains constant. The results indicate that an external cathode alters the plume symmetry and creates a region of increased ion flux. An analysis of the cathode generated species densities indicates that the increase in ion current density is caused by nonuniform ingestion of cathode neutrals and nonuniform electron density near the cathode. This phenomenon can affect thruster plume measurements as well as the orientation of thrusters for satellite integration.",30,2
