This study applies an advanced design methodology combining computational fluid dynamics and evolutionary algorithms assisted by surrogate modeling to a multi-objective optimization for fuel injection in a Mach 5.7 crossflow after the initial compression in a scramjet intake operating at Mach 7.6. Optimization is performed for elliptical injector configurations defined by four design parameters (i.e., the injection angle, spanwise spacing, aspect ratio, and radius of the injector), simultaneously aiming to maximize three objectives, that is, fuel/air mixing, total pressure saving, and fuel penetration into the crossflow. Statistical methods based on global sensitivity analysis are employed to assess the optimization results in conjunction with surrogate models to identify key design factors with respect to the three design objectives and additional performance measures. Major effects of the injection angle and aspect ratio have been observed on all considered design criteria. The spanwise spacing has been found to have considerable influence on the total pressure recovery, fuel penetration, and lateral spread when the injection pressure is adjusted to maintain a constant fuel/air equivalence ratio. Low-angle fuel injection through a highly elliptic orifice with wide spanwise spacing demonstrated the most comprehensive advantages in overall aspects.",31,6
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35689,"Flame stabilization in a dual-mode scramjet combustor was studied using simultaneous detection of flowfield and reaction zone. The instantaneous reactive flowfield was clearly visualized using an improved pulsed schlieren system, whereas the reaction zone was marked by chemiluminescence. Experiments were performed in a Mach 2.5 model combustor with the total temperature of and the total pressure of 1.0 MPa. Ethylene was used as fuel with equivalence ratios varied from 0.258 to 0.411. Four typical flame stabilized locations and corresponding flowfields are presented. When no choke occurs, the flame is stabilized in the cavity or the shear layer. Schlieren images show that the flow in the reaction zone of the latter case is supersonic. When the combustor is choked at the injection location, the flame oscillates between the shear layer and the jet wake, and the flow in the reaction zone becomes subsonic. When the flame is stabilized in the jet wake, autoignition can occur due to the compression of precombustion shock train. The short-lived aerodynamic throat formed near the injection location may be the possible cause for triggering the unsteady flame oscillation. The effects of heat release on flame stabilization modes are discussed.",31,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35685,"The mixing flowfields of transverse walled fuel injection with and without the guidance of a fin in a Mach 2.2 flow were experimentally characterized and compared. This study evaluated the ability of fin-guided injection to enhance fuel–air mixing while reducing shock-induced stagnation pressure losses. The nonreacting gaseous injection experiments used helium as a hydrogen surrogate and simulated four mass flow rate conditions to investigate the performance of the proposed injection scheme with variable jet momentum. The analysis of schlieren visualizations demonstrated a 100–200% increase in jet penetration for the fin-guided cases over the baseline 12 diameters downstream of the injection point. Wall pressure measurements were correlated to the schlieren results which showed that the strength of the jet-induced shock in the baseline was reduced by 33–47% by using the fin. A planar-Mie scattering method used to obtain cross-sectional views of the injection flowfields revealed that the fin was not only responsible for raising the fuel jet away from the wall but also enabled its vertical spreading. The present results demonstrate that this fin geometry can enhance mixing via increased penetration and spreading, reduce the strength of jet-induced shocks, and potentially displace the reaction zone away from the combustor wall.",31,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35212,A preliminary design optimization of a revolutionary concept involving integrated airbreathing propulsive assist is presented. The conceptual design for the proposed airbreathing thrust augmenter is an annular ramjet/scramjet integrated into a liquid-oxygen-rocket propellant rocket core. The airbreathing engine makes use of the same tankage and turbopump hardware as the rocket engine for supplying fuel. The aeropropulsive environment is simulated using an axisymmetric Euler solver with a decoupled semiempirical viscous model. The flight performance is simulated using a seventh- to eight-order Runge–Kutta integrator for the six-degree-of-freedom dynamics. The optimizer used for design iterations is a binary-encoded genetic algorithm with a proven track record for addressing complex flight vehicle design problems. Results show the marked improvement in performance achieved by the use of such thrust augmenters on a military-dominated niche of the overall spectrum of missile designs.,31,6

This paper presents the results of a numerical study that investigates the effects of various orifice shapes on fuel mixing characteristics into hypersonic airflow at Mach 5, aiming at the application to scramjet operation with upstream fuel injection at Mach 10. The performance of the injectors at an inclination angle of 45 deg are assessed with respect to various criteria such as the mixing efficiency, streamwise circulation, total pressure recovery, fuel penetration, and spread. Streamwise slot injectors have been found to yield higher mixing efficiency than the other injectors tested (namely, square, circular, diamond, and triangular injectors), owing to the buffering effects. Apparent higher total pressure recovery has been obtained with these rectangular injectors, but their advantages have diminished significantly with the alignment of the trailing-edge position. The highest vertical penetration has been achieved by the square injector, whereas the performances of other injectors with a sharp leading edge have been found to be affected considerably by the axis switch phenomenon due to inclined injection at higher injection pressure. A major influence of the fore and aft shapes of the orifice has been observed on the three-dimensional bow shock formation and wake recirculation, respectively.",31,6

This study investigates the fluid dynamic performance and angle of attack, or pitch, sensitivity of two similar inlet geometries. The computations employ three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations, while the experimental data were derived from the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field supersonic tunnel. Test conditions were based on a free-stream Mach number of 1.66 and pitch angles from to . Instrumentation includes stagnation pressure rakes in the core and bypass streams, as well as centerbody surface pressures. The two geometries were found to deliver high recovery flow to the engine face at zero pitch. At finite pitch angles, lower recovery flow was observed near the cowl, caused by the change in shock structure, but was successfully diverted to the bypass stream, and good levels of core stream recovery were maintained. The experiments showed a fuller boundary layer on the centerbody surface, while the outer core boundary layer was thinner than predicted. The measured core stream recovery at 5 deg pitch was 0.5–1.0% higher than in the simulations over a range of core flow rates.",31,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35549,"Within the past 10 years, significant improvements have been achieved in the laser manufacturing process. It is feasible now to design various small-scale surface features (such as dimples, riblets, grooves, etc.) in gas turbine applications with the current manufacturing readiness level of laser surface texturing techniques. In this paper, the potential of adding riblets on a turbine endwall has been investigated through combined computational fluid dynamics and experimental studies in a low-speed linear cascade environment. Detailed comparisons of the flow structures have been made for cases with and without riblets on the endwall. The numerical results show that endwall riblets can effectively reduce the strength of the pressure side leg of the horseshoe vortex, lower the cross-passage pressure gradient, and alleviate the lift up of the passage vortex. Oil film flow visualization and exit aerodynamic loss survey in experiments support the computational fluid dynamics observations: The passage vortex loss core moves closer to the endwall with the addition of riblets. The present study consistently demonstrates that the addition of riblets can be an effective approach to reduce the endwall secondary flow. Further research questions are raised for the applicability of the riblets concept in actual engine conditions and options for design optimization.",31,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35486,"This paper identifies and analyzes the propagation of aerodynamic deterministic stresses through a two-spool counter-rotating transonic facility representative of modern and future turbine aeroengine sections. The test setup consists of a high-pressure stage, a diffusing turning midturbine frame with turning struts, and a counter-rotating low-pressure rotor. The flowfield downstream of the high-pressure stage is strongly influenced by the stator–rotor interaction. Such a mechanism interacts again with the downstream turning midturbine frame leading to a vane–rotor–vane interaction, which affects the behavior of the low-pressure stage. The results presented were obtained using a fast-response aerodynamic pressure probe for unsteady measurements as well as three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculations. The work is presented in two parts. This first part focuses on the explanation of the flow physics that governs the convection of unsteady three-dimensional flow through the midturbine duct. Viscous and inviscid mechanisms are discussed as main drivers for the convection of wakes, secondary vortices, and shocks. The flowfield in the duct is characterized by three superimposed effects: 1) duct diffusion and radial pressure gradient together with turning strut potential field, 2) rotor unsteady work source, and 3) vane/blade interaction phenomena. The understanding of these mechanisms will eventually help to control the unsteadiness content in future architectures where reduced engine component length will enhance the interaction effects.",31,6

The test setup consists of a high-pressure stage, a diffusing midturbine frame with turning struts and a counter-rotating low-pressure rotor. The discussion of the data is carried out in this second part paper on the basis of spectral analysis. The theoretical framework for a double Fourier decomposition, in time and space, is introduced and discussed. The aim of the paper is the identification of the sources of deterministic stresses that propagate through the turbine. A fast-response aerodynamic pressure probe has been employed to provide time-resolved data downstream of the high-pressure rotor and of the turning strut. The fast-response aerodynamic pressure probe measurements were acquired together with a reference signal (a laser vibrometer) downstream of the high-pressure rotor to identify different sources of deterministic fluctuations. The discussion is completed by fast-response pressure measurements on the strut surface and computational fluid dynamics computation to detail which deterministic stress related to the high-pressure stage propagates through the duct. The double Fourier decomposition shows that structures at the periodicity of the rotor blade number decay, whereas the unsteadiness at the outlet of the duct is the result of vane–rotor–vane interaction.",31,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35543,"Centrifugal compressors are required to increase their operating range and efficiency, which are limited at low mass flow rates by the rotating stall and surge. This paper presents a surrogate-based multi-objective optimization of a centrifugal compressor to improve its efficiency and stall margin. Curvatures of the blade, the impeller shroud, and the diffuser hub are selected as optimization parameters since they influence highly both the efficiency and the stall limit. The implemented optimization procedure starts by the construction of a metamodel, which is the radial basis function that uses a database composed of a well-selected set of geometries and their corresponding computational fluid dynamics predicted objectives using the Ansys-CFX 12 code. The NSGA-II optimization algorithm is used afterward to search the Pareto front based on radial basis function approximations. To improve the accuracy of the radial basis function and subsequently the Pareto front, a database refinement is sequentially achieved, using the leave-one-out-cross-validation uncertainty to select infill points. The present procedure is tested on the NASA low-speed centrifugal compressor, showing its ability to increase both the compressor operating range and efficiency. Furthermore, the flow pattern analysis confirms the suppression of separations that lead to instability in the optimized compressor at the stall point of the baseline design.",31,6

Transient infrared thermography is used to evaluate film-cooling performance of cylindrical and fan-shaped holes in a test facility representing engine conditions. Adiabatic film effectiveness and net heat flux reduction results due to coolant injection through double and multiple rows in the presence and absence of an upstream showerhead are presented. Two double staggered rows at different positions have been cross compared: one at a relatively high convex curvature region and the other close to the maximum throat velocity. A combination of the two double rows is considered to be multiple rows. The tested blowing ratios are in the interval of [0.6–1.2] and [0.3–1.2] for double and multiple rows, respectively. The showerhead cooling is maintained at a nominal blowing ratio. The findings suggest that the choice of best cooling hole shape for film-cooling design can be highly influenced by the number of cooling rows to be used and also the presence (or absence) of showerhead cooling. It is worth noting that the outcome may differ depending on the quantity of interest (i.e., adiabatic film effectiveness or net heat flux reduction).",31,6

The catalytic activity of aluminum/boron/iron-oxide nanothermites for ammonium perchlorate decomposition was studied by thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry. Compared with the thermal decomposition of pure ammonium perchlorate, 7 wt % aluminum/boron/iron-oxide nanothermites decreased the decomposition temperature of ammonium perchlorate by 69°C and increased its apparent decomposition heat by .

In addition, the obtained aluminum/boron/iron-oxide nanothermites have higher catalytic activity than the simple mixed sample, which is attributed to the large specific surface area and the nanoporous structure.",31,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35305,"Atomization mechanism of gelled propellants in an impinging jet flowfield is significantly different from that of nongelled liquid propellants and is not clearly understood. This study explores the effect of liquid fluid properties such as viscosity and surface tension on the liquid sheet breakup with a special emphasis on the effect of ambient pressure. A rheologically matched non-Newtonian fluid that is nonreactive and nontoxic is used as a simulant for the gelled hypergolic propellants. Near-field spray characteristics such as the sheet formation and breakup length of the liquid sheet are experimentally determined using shadowgraph. Various sheet breakup regimes have been identified for both nongelled and gelled simulants over a range of flow conditions. For all fluids, the breakup length is found to decrease as the ambient pressure increases. Near-field imaging and its analysis show that the ambient pressure affects jet surface dynamics before impingement by increasing the jet surface disturbance length scale and sheet dynamics after impingement by shortening the surface wavelength, resulting in shorter breakup length with the increase of ambient pressure.",31,6

Liquid expands radially from the impact point, forming a bay-leaf-shaped sheet bounded by a thicker rim. A theoretical model for two power-law impinging jets is established. Sheet velocity distribution is deduced through energy conservation during impingement; other sheet features are predicted by solving conservation equations for mass and momentum of the sheet rim where equivalent viscosity is proposed. The predicted sheet shape and rim diameter are compared to experiments, and they share good consistency.

15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35526,"This experimental study focuses on characterizing the nonlinear combustion dynamics prior to blowout in a partially premixed combustor with a swirl-stabilized burner. Experiments were performed by varying the global equivalence ratio from 0.92 to 0.33. The acquired time-series data of pressure fluctuations were analyzed using nonlinear time-series analysis. When the combustor was operated at an equivalence ratio of 0.92, broadband low-amplitude pressure oscillations called combustion noise were observed. As the equivalence ratio is decreased to 0.62, the oscillations change their characteristics from low-amplitude broadband oscillations to high-amplitude discrete tones, and the combustor undergoes limit-cycle oscillations. A sharp peak is observed in the amplitude spectra of the acoustic pressure oscillations at this stage. On reducing the equivalence ratio to 0.42 and lower, the periodic motion is interrupted by occasional irregular bursts and the system switches back and forth between the noisy (periodic) and quiet (aperiodic) zones. In the dynamical systems theory parlance, this irregular switching between periodic and aperiodic behaviors is termed intermittency. On reducing the equivalence ratio further, the system reaches blowout condition. Intermittency can be used as the signature prior to flame blowout. The dynamical patterns and inherent nonlinearity during the transition from chaotic behavior to intermittent burst oscillations prior to blowout are shown qualitatively by drawing phase portraits, return maps, and recurrence plots.",31,6
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35649,"This research investigation encompasses experimental tests demonstrating the control of a high-frequency combustion instability by acoustically modulating the propellant flow. This investigation complements an accompanying theoretical study implementing linear modal analysis [Bennewitz, J. W., Rani, S. L., Cranford, J. T., and Frederick, R. A., Jr., “Combustion Instability Control Through Acoustic Modulation at the Inlet Boundary: Analysis,” Journal of Propulsion and Power, (to be published)]. A model rocket combustor burned gaseous oxygen and methane using a single-element pentad-style injector. Flow conditions were established that spontaneously excited a 2430 Hz first longitudinal combustion oscillation at an amplitude up to . An acoustic speaker was placed at the base of the oxidizer supply line to modulate the flow and alter the oscillatory behavior of the combustor. Two speaker modulation approaches were investigated: 1) bands of white noise, and 2) pure sinusoidal tones. The first approach adjusted 500 Hz bands of white noise ranging from 0–500 to 2000–2500 Hz, whereas the second approach implemented individual harmonic signals with arbitrary phase swept from 500 to 2500 Hz. The results show that, above a modulation signal amplitude threshold, both approaches suppressed % of the spontaneous combustion oscillation. By increasing the applied signal amplitude, a wider frequency range of instability suppression became present for these two acoustic modulation approaches. Thus, this work further supports the strategic application of acoustic modulation within an injector as a potential method to control high-frequency combustion instabilities for liquid rocket engine applications.",31,6

This study complements an accompanying experimental investigation that demonstrates combustion instability control through single-frequency acoustic modulation at the inlet [Bennewitz, J. W., Frederick, R. A., Jr., Cranford, J. T., Lineberry, D. M., “Combustion Instability Control Through Acoustic Modulation at the Inlet Boundary: Experiments,” Journal of Propulsion and Power (to be published)]. The modal analysis employs acoustically consistent matching conditions instead of the conventional mass, momentum, and energy balances. A specific impedance boundary condition at the inlet is derived through a mass-spring-damper model of a speaker diaphragm that provides the acoustic modulation. The speaker model constants are obtained from an apparatus consisting of a speaker attached to a short hard-wall-terminated duct. At first, the modal analysis is shown to predict a naturally unstable first longitudinal mode in the absence of acoustic modulation, consistent with the spontaneously excited combustion instability mode observed experimentally. Subsequently, a detailed investigation involving variation of the modulation frequency from 0 to 2500 Hz and a mean combustor temperature from 1248 to 1685 K demonstrates the unstable to stable transition of a 2300–2500 Hz first longitudinal mode. The model-predicted mode stability transition is consistent with experimental observations, thereby supporting the premise that inlet acoustic modulation is a means to control high-frequency combustion instabilities. From the modal analysis, it may be deduced that the inlet impedance provides a damping mechanism for instability suppression.",31,6

Experimental results are obtained from a self-excited, multi-element, high-pressure model rocket combustor. The simulation uses a velocity forcing technique to match the frequency and amplitude of the pressure oscillations that are measured in the combustor. Chemiluminescence is used to indirectly measure heat release rate in the experimental investigation. Detailed comparisons between the predicted and measured pressure field and the predicted and measured heat release modes are made.

The aim of computational fluid dynamics modeling is to simulate the wall heat flux, which has been measured experimentally. The simulated combustion chamber has a single shear coaxial injector and operates with gaseous oxygen and hydrogen in a staged combustion configuration. The turbulent flow in the combustion chamber is modeled using the Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and the shear-stress transport turbulence model. The turbulent non-premixed flame is modeled using an extended eddy dissipation model. The developed turbulent combustion model shows good agreement with the experimental data, good convergence, and a short computational time. A mesh convergence study is performed, and a mesh-independent solution is obtained on a mesh with 1.5 million nodes. The complexity of the model is gradually increased until the model is capable of predicting the wall heat flux.

A Lagrangian spray model is used to simulate the liquid phase. This liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen single element combustor experiment has been the focus of many numerical studies. In contrast to previous investigations, time-accurate unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations are performed. A good spatial resolution is achieved by using a fifth-order multidimensional limiting process scheme to discretize the inviscid fluxes. Instead of assuming axisymmetry, the three-dimensional geometry of the rectangular combustor is taken into account. However, only a quarter of the combustor is simulated, to limit the computational cost. Presented results indicate that three-dimensional effects are important, questioning the assumption of axisymmetry. A second important finding is that time-averaged unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes results agree much better with experimental data than those of a comparable steady-state simulation. Close to the injector, results show a strong unsteadiness of the turbulent flame, which has been observed in the experiment, too. Finally, pressure fluctuations are monitored at several positions in the combustor and analyzed by fast Fourier transform. The peak amplitudes in the pressure spectra could successfully be assigned to the first longitudinal acoustic mode and its higher harmonics.",31,6
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35615,"Results from a development campaign, where modern additive manufacturing methods are used to fabricate hybrid rocket fuel grains with embedded helical ports, are presented. The fuel grains were constructed from acrlyonitrile butadiene styrene using commercially available three-dimensional printer feedstock material. Gaseous oxygen is used as the oxidizer for this test campaign. When compared to cylindrical fuel ports, significant increases in fuel regression rates were observed, and these increases in regression rate diminished with time as the helical fuel port burns to become progressively more cylindrical. Comparisons to the helical pipe flow skin friction correlation developed by Mishra and Gupta indicate that increased skin friction only partially accounts for the increased regression rate. The Mishra–Gupta correlation underpredicts the regression rate amplification early in the fuel burn and overpredicts that value late in the burn. The authors conclude that radial wall-blowing due to fuel pyrolysis is suppressed by centrifugal forces introduced by the helical flow and compresses the boundary-layer flame zone closer to the fuel port wall. Thus, convective heat transfer is significantly enhanced, and that effect also contributes significantly to the observed regression rate increase. This effect diminishes with time and is not modeled by the Mishra–Gupta correlation.",31,6

Strategic application of an electric field across the top of an additively manufactured acrylonitrile butadiene styrene fuel grain induces an electrostatic arc along the horizontally stacked manufactured surface features, and results in a small amount of pyrolyzed fuel vapor. When this event occurs simultaneous with the introduction of an oxidizing flow, the ablated hydrocarbon vapor together with residual energy from the electrical arc rapidly seeds combustion. Multiple incremental prototype systems were designed, built, and tested. Best conditions for successful operation were discovered, including minimum ignition pressure, optimal geometry, and electrical power requirements.

The background radiation, the high velocities and temperature of gases, and the small time scales characterizing the flow downstream of the nozzle make the diagnostics difficult to achieve. In fact, the thrust curve and time history of the head-end pressure often are the only data available. In this work, the flow is studied by analyzing the overall radiative emissions of the plume in the UV-visible band ( wavelength band). The main result is that the particles ejected along with the exhaust gases are well suited as seeding for a correlation-based velocimetry technique. Furthermore, a wavelet expansion of the radiative emission signal provides the extraction of an averaged time scale and the time location of the radiant signature associated to the particles. A conditioned cross-correlation is computed to measure the velocity of the ejected particles that is representative of the flow velocity. From the radiative emission sampled at two locations along the rocket plume, a transition from quasi-periodic to turbulent flow is also observed.",31,6

In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical simulation code is developed using a hybrid immersed-finite-element particle-in-cell method and Monte Carlo collisions method; the dynamics of a neutral atom is modeled using a direct simulation Monte Carlo method; and a numerical simulation study is run to investigate the mechanism of aperture barrel erosion of an ion thruster accelerator grid. Simulation results indicate that the aperture barrel erosion of ion thruster accelerator grid is entirely caused by the charge-exchange ions under nominal operating condition, and the incident charge-exchange ions in four regions, namely the upstream region, the extraction (center) region, the extraction (edge) region, and downstream of the accelerator grid, are the causes of aperture barrel erosion. High-energy charge-exchange ions originated from upstream region are not well focused and play an important role in the erosion of the aperture barrel. Charge-exchange ions originated from the extraction (center) region, which play an important role in the whole incident charge-exchange ions, also cause significant erosion on the aperture barrel. It is therefore believed that these findings would facilitate the prediction of aperture barrel erosion of an ion thruster accelerator grid.",31,6
