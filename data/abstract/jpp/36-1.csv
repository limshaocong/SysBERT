1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37381,"Understanding the effects of property variations on velocity and temperature profiles is important for the accurate prediction of supercritical heat transfer in regenerative cooling channels. In this study, direct numerical simulations of a planar turbulent channel flow with a wall-normal temperature gradient were conducted to understand the mean temperature profiles that are affected by property variations at supercritical pressure. The working fluid used was supercritical nitrogen. The density ratios between two walls were four and eight. The Van Driest transformation for the mean velocity profiles holds true in the present conditions. This result implies that discussions based on a mixing length hypothesis are valid for the conditions that were studied. Mean temperature profiles in the viscous sublayer are correlated to those of incompressible constant-property flows using a local Prandtl number. For the mean temperature profiles in the logarithmic region, a new temperature transform equation that accounts for the variation in mean density and isobaric specific heat was introduced. It was demonstrated that the gradients of temperature profiles transformed by the transform equation coincide with the ones in incompressible constant-property flows in the logarithmic region.",36,1
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37550,"A 2-kW-class magnetically shielded Hall thruster was developed, and its performance was evaluated. Additionally, the effects of the discharge channel length, thruster body potential, anode dielectric coating, and vacuum facility on its performance were investigated. A low discharge channel erosion rate of the thruster configuration with a normalized channel length of 0.74 was achieved at a 2 kW operation with discharge voltages ranging from 300 to 800 V. Moreover, the thrust performance of the magnetically shielded thruster was comparable to that of the unshielded thruster. At the 2 kW operation, the magnetically shielded thruster achieved a throttling range of the specific impulse from 1680 to 2440 s without a strong discharge current oscillation . The propellant flow density at a discharge voltage of 300 V was sufficiently high to achieve an efficient operation at an input power of 2.1 kW. However, the proper input power to achieve efficient operation at a discharge voltage of 800 V was approximately 4 kW because the propellant flow density at a total input power of 2.1 kW was significantly rarefied. Stable operation was maintained when the input power reduced from 4.2 to 2.1 kW, whereas the thrust efficiency degraded from 0.508 to 0.429.",36,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37599,"In this work, a krypton Hall thruster is used to study the influence of low-frequency oscillation on the focusing characteristics of the plasma beam. The experiment results show that the plume divergence half-angle of the krypton thruster is sensitive to the low-frequency oscillation. Through monitoring the ionization process inside the discharge channel, it is found that the low-frequency oscillation leads to extending of the propellant ionization region downstream and, at the same time, the electron temperature is increased near the channel exit. As a result, the deviation of space potential lines from the magnetic lines is enhanced. These are the dominant physical mechanisms to affect the plasma beam focusing characteristics for the krypton Hall thruster.",36,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37416,"This work was undertaken in an effort to improve the understanding of the combustion processes inside classical and fast-burning hybrid rocket motors. In this paper, a combustion visualization experiment and various optics were used to explore the mass transfer phenomena, boundary-layer growth rates, and the flame location above combusting fuels at atmospheric and elevated chamber pressures. The results presented provide strong confirmation of the basic droplet formation and entrainment mechanism for fast-burning fuels at operating conditions representative of those in a typical hybrid rocket motor. Entrained filament structures were not observed to be the dominant feature at chamber pressures above the critical pressure of the fuel; instead, at high pressures, numerous intense mass ejection events emitting large numbers of droplets were observed to be a major mass transfer mechanism. Imaging diagnostics were successfully used to quantify the location of the flame and the boundary-layer edge for classical and high-regression-rate fuels at a range of operating conditions. The imaging systems are also used in conjunction with chamber pressure data to examine the flameholding instability around the leading edge of the fuel grain.",36,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37299,"A numerical study is conducted to investigate the impact of a film-cooled dual-bell nozzle extension on its operation mode transition behavior. Therefore, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations of the transition process between the sea level and altitude modes are carried out. The investigated dual-bell nozzle model is fed with hot gas by a combustion chamber using liquid oxygen as oxidizer and gaseous hydrogen as fuel. Upstream of the dual-bell nozzle contour inflection, gaseous hydrogen is injected as cooling fluid for the nozzle extension wall. The numerical studies yield a clear impact of the cooling fluid mass flow rate on the transition nozzle pressure ratio of the dual-bell nozzle. The increase of the cooling fluid mass flow rate leads to a shift of the dual-bell transition nozzle pressure ratio to lower values. Furthermore, the impact of the combustion chamber mixture ratio on the dual-bell operation mode transition is investigated. A clear shift to lower transition nozzle pressure ratio values due to higher propellant mixture ratios can be observed. A combination of the two effects is introduced for an active control of the dual-bell operation mode transition.",36,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37532,"This work aims to identify the key flow parameters that influence flame acceleration in a semiconfined square channel. A transverse fluidic jet was used as an active flow blockage mechanism and to introduce turbulence into the propagating flame. Three experimental parameters were used to examine the relative influence of 1) mixture reactivity (defined here as system equivalence ratio, SER), 2) jet mixture composition (JMC), and 3) the momentum ratio (MR) on the acceleration of laminar premixed methane flame. High-speed particle image velocimetry and schlieren photography were used to characterize the instantaneous flowfield conditions throughout the flame–jet interaction. Using these diagnostic techniques, flame front positions and local velocity vector fields have been spatially and temporally resolved. Changes in flame properties, including flame structure, velocity, and vorticity, were tracked as functions of time. Stoichiometric equivalence ratios were more effective in the production of vorticity and the promotion of flame acceleration. The stoichiometric condition accelerated the flame to the highest final flame velocity of the three parameters examined. Different compositions of the jet mixture demonstrated that the flame acceleration is primarily affected by the jet turbulence and not on the reactivity of the jet compositions. The MR parameter had the least amount of influence on the flowfield and flame acceleration. The increase of 33% in the MR had negligible effect on the final flame front velocity and implies that the jet turbulence is the main driving mechanism for flame acceleration.",36,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37636,"The effects of hollow cathode position on thrust performances of a diverging-magnetic-field electrostatic thruster, which had a diverging magnetic field between a ring anode and a hollow cathode, were investigated. The hollow cathode was located in either a central or an external configuration. Based on the discharge current and direct thrust measurements, electrostatic and magnetic hybrid plasma acceleration was observed in the central cathode operation and even in the external cathode operation especially when magnetic field strength was less than 315 mT. However, the operating points were different: low discharge discharge current in the central cathode operation, and high discharge discharge current in the external cathode operation. This difference comes from electron-Hall parameter; the estimated electron-Hall parameter was about 50 in the central cathode operation, which was much lower than that of 3000 in the external cathode operation. By combining electromagnetic acceleration, the generated thrust can increase even with lower electron-Hall parameter operation. As a result, similar thrust performances were achieved in both cathode positions. Because of the hybrid plasma acceleration method, thrust density reached , which is comparable or even higher than that of the conventional electrostatic thrusters.",36,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37415,"This paper considers a hybrid electric propulsion architecture where most of the electric power is transmitted from the generator to the motors without conversion. Doubly fed induction machines are chosen for generation and propulsion, due to their ability to operate over a range of speeds using reduced-size power converters. The focus of this paper is on the presentation and demonstration of a strategy that allows for the stable and independent operation of multiple motors using the power produced by a single generator. The control methodology includes synchronization, soft-start, and closed-loop speed control of each motor as a means of controlling output thrust. The validation is carried out on a low-power test bed using fractional horsepower machines. The success obtained at a small-scale suggests that the proposed strategy would be worth evaluating at higher power levels, with a potential application to commercial transport aircraft.",36,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37682,"Cavitation is one of the main causes of failure in rocket engine cryopumps. Based on a visual experimental platform for liquid-nitrogen cavitating flow over a NACA 66 hydrofoil, morphology evolutions of the cavity cloud for different cavitation numbers are observed with a high-speed camera. The time-averaged pressure distributions in the cavitation zone are also measured, and the maximum temperature drop is derived from the pressure data by assuming the thermodynamic equilibrium in the cavitation zone. The attached cavitation length is dependent on the cavitation number, and the relationship is investigated by image analysis using the standard-deviation method. The shedding characteristics of the cavitation cloud of and room-temperature water are compared, and the mechanism is qualitatively clarified. The research results provide valuable experimental data, which are rare in this field, and help to understand the influence of cryogenic cavitation.",36,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37485,"The effects of altering ammonium perchlorate (AP) particle size or concentration in composite AP/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) solid propellants are well documented. Existing propellant burning rate datasets include these variations, but they have significant holes in their current data span. In the current study, isophorone diisocyanate-cured composite AP/HTPB propellants were manufactured with AP mass concentrations between 70 and 87.5% and unimodal AP sizes between 20 and ; and propellant burning rates were evaluated at pressures of 3.4–21 MPa (500–3000 psia). Decreasing the AP particle size or increasing the AP concentration yielded increases in burning rate, as expected. The AP particle size effect is more drastic than that of the AP concentration. The resulting dataset was coupled with several existing propellant datasets from the literature to develop, for the first time, a simple, empirical correlation that captures these effects. The developed correlation accurately predicts the propellant burning rates for a large span of AP particle sizes and concentrations over a wide range of pressures.",36,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37709,"A hybrid electric configuration for aircraft propulsion yields several advantages, such as reducing the fuel consumption and takeoff distance, improving control, and decreasing emissions. For such a scenario to occur, advances designed to increase the power-to-weight ratio of actual electric motors must be developed. Superconducting technologies offer the prospect of achieving such performances but at a cost of increased design and construction complexities. In that sense, stacks of high-temperature superconductors have proven to trap high-current vortexes that provide a source of magnetic flux density for torque production without the need of current leads or other equipment in the rotor. However, these macroscopic currents must be induced before operation and remain undisturbed by variations in the magnetic flux density of the air gap, such as the ones caused by heating and demagnetization. This work presents the results of numerical computations on a new rotor architecture designed to facilitate the magnetization of stacks from a superconducting stator and prevent their demagnetization during torque production. The machine performance is assessed, and the expected survivability of the trapped-flux in stacks is compared with laboratory measurements.",36,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37597,"The goal of this work was to quantify the uncertainty in the solution of a scramjet isolator flowfield due to the uncertainty in the closure coefficients of commonly used turbulence models in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. The Menter baseline, Menter shear stress transport, Spalart–Allmaras, and Wilcox-2006 turbulence models were examined; and simulations were carried out using the VULCAN flow solver. Nonintrusive polynomial chaos theory was used for efficient uncertainty propagation, and Sobol indices were employed to establish relative sensitivities of the flow solution to closure coefficients. The results obtained were compared to experimental data as well as to previous work focusing on relevant flow problems. Sets of closure coefficients that contribute most to solution uncertainty for each turbulence model were identified, which warrant further investigation because more knowledge about the effects of these coefficients is expected to reduce the uncertainty in the numerical design of scramjet isolators.",36,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37613,"Wax is a brittle thermoplastic material, and its physical properties must be improved so that it can be used as fuel in hybrid rockets. In this study, we use microcrystalline wax and paraffin wax by mixing ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and stearic acid; conduct tensile tests and firing tests; and measure viscosities to obtain the effect of improvement in physical properties on the regression rate. According to the results, microcrystalline wax has higher strength than paraffin wax, and the tensile strength increases as the EVA and the stearic acid contents increase. By contrast, mixing EVA with wax decreases the regression rate, but mixing stearic acid hardly affects the regression rate. The regression rates of these wax-based fuels increase almost proportionally with power of the coefficient of the viscosity of molten fuel at a constant temperature, which agrees with the results of the theoretical analysis.",36,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37676,"Thermometry measurements were performed in a scramjet combustor using thermally-assisted laser-induced fluorescence. Experimental data were obtained through laser-induced fluorescence where a laser beam was focused into the combustor and the OH transition at 283.55 nm was excited. Measurements in the 360 nm spectral region resulted in detection of a strong fluorescence line. Investigation of this phenomenon led to the conclusion that when the OH line is chosen for excitation, another line of a different species that lies very close to is also unintentionally excited. The second species has been identified as iron, Fe I. The assumption is that the erosion of the shock tunnel walls introduced iron in the flow that is excited with the laser when exciting OH. Thus, it is very important to ensure that this is avoided in future. Instead, another OH excitation line should be used for OH excitation line in planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) experiments where iron may potentially also be present in the flow. Alternatively, fluorescence from this iron line can be circumvented by proper filtering of the PLIF. A proposal is made to turn the iron contamination into advantage by using iron present in the non-combusting flow for PLIF.",36,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37674,"An experimental investigation of an underexpanded supersonic jet issuing from a circular nozzle, an elliptical nozzle, and an elliptical nozzle with an aft deck at different nozzle pressure ratios (NPRs) is reported in this paper. Static-pressure measurements over the nozzle walls were analyzed to understand the internal flow structure. Schlieren visualization and conical probe measurements were conducted to elucidate the development of the jets issuing from the nozzles. The sound-pressure level in the near field was measured, and it was found that the screech amplitudes were 26 dB lower in the elliptical nozzle with an aft deck. The screech-tone frequencies were observed to be above and near audible region (16 kHz) in the presence of the aft deck at NPRs 3 and 4. The jets emanating from the circular and truncated elliptical nozzles were observed to be flapping about the jet axis at NPRs 3 and 4. The unsteadiness of the jet was reduced by locking the jet onto the aft deck. The centerline Mach-number decay revealed that, due to the screeching effect, the truncated elliptical nozzle has a shorter potential core length and larger jet spreading. The flow separation and reattachment were observed over the aft-deck surface for higher NPR conditions.",36,1
