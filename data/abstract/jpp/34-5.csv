1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36594,"Film cooling is a key technology to improve the thermal performance of high-pressure turbines. The mixing of the cooling air and the main flow is inherently unsteady, but the unsteady flow physics of different cooling holes are seldom investigated. In the current study, the large-eddy simulation method is used to investigate inclined jets in crossflow via a cylindrical hole and a fan-shaped hole. The angle between the hole and the main flow is 35 deg, and the blowing ratio is 0.5, which are representative for film cooling. First, the results are analyzed in a traditional way using counter-rotational vortices based on the time-averaged results. Then, the instantaneous flowfield is presented. The mixing of the injected flow with the main flow is highly related to the unsteady coherent vortices. The results showed that the instantaneous flowfield can provide a better explanation of the distribution of film-cooling effectiveness than the time-averaged flowfield. The effects of instantaneous vortices on the temperature distribution for different cooling hole geometry are discussed in detail.",34,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36770,"A particle–particle (PP) model is developed to simulate ion thruster beam neutralization by thermal electrons emitted from a neutralizer located outside of the ion beam. Simulations are carried out using the real xenon to electron mass ratio. The results show that beam neutralization is initiated by an electron–ion mixing process in which the thermal electrons are trapped by the potential well in the ion beam and undergo an oscillation between the ion beam boundaries both along the beam direction and in the radial direction. The bouncing of the electrons in the radial direction generates transient oscillating perturbations inside the beam in both electron density and the electric field in the radial direction, which eventually dissipate when the electrons are thermalized and the ion beam is neutralized. The PP method directly uses Coulomb’s law to calculate the electrostatic force between particles and thus eliminates the constraints on mesh resolution and domain size of the particle-in-cell method. This method can be advantageous computationally when applied to simulations of very nonuniform, collisionless plasmas such as the plasma plume near ion thruster exit.",34,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36839,"This paper investigated the predictions of the axial-injection end-burning hybrid rocket motor regression rate model developed by Hitt and Frederick. Because axial-injection end-burning hybrid rocket motors follow a regression rate trend based on chamber pressure (like a solid rocket motor) instead of oxidizer mass flux (like a classical hybrid), it was expected that axial-injection end-burning hybrids would have additional regression rate trends similar to what is observed in solid rocket motors. As such, model predictions based on variations in chamber pressure, fuel grain temperature, oxidizer mass flow rate, and oxidizer pore size were investigated. The results of the modeling predicted that increases in the grain temperature increased the regression rate; but, increases in the oxidizer mass flow rate would decrease the regression rate. Increasing the oxidizer pore size was predicted to decrease the regression rate, with the effect increasing with chamber pressure as the flame became more diffusion limited. These results provide a better understanding of the axial-injection end-burning hybrid design, and thus better insight into where to focus further research.",34,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36661,"A propulsion concept relying on the direct steady-state acceleration of a plasma by an inductive wave-launching antenna is presented. By operating inductively in steady state, a direct wave-drive thruster (DWDT) avoids drawbacks associated with pulsed acceleration and electrode erosion. The generalized relations for the scaling of thrust and efficiency are derived analytically. Thrust is shown to scale with the square of the antenna current, and efficiency is shown to increase with increasing current or power. The total force and resistive losses between an annular antenna and a finite-conductivity plasma slab are modeled. Calculations from the model suggest four design criteria for efficient performance of a DWDT: the size of the device must be large when compared to both the standoff distance and plasma skin depth, the excitation frequency must be as large as the electron collision frequency, and the resistive losses within the wave-launching antenna must be minimized. A sample evaluation is performed with the model to illustrate the potential performance for a thruster operating at 10 kW with a mass flow rate of at typical plasma parameters, and the maximum efficiency is found to have an upper bound near 50%.",34,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36692,"In this paper, the flame structure of a liquid propellant ammonium dinitramide–methanol aqueous solution in a small model thruster is investigated. The thruster is composed of an injector and a combustion chamber (including a catalyst bed) with optical windows, through which the combustion process in the atmosphere is inspected, and the temperature distribution along the flame is measured by the tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy method. Obvious fluctuations in temperature and flickering yellowish flame downstream of the combustion chamber are observed, indicating that the combustion is not stable. The mean temperature distribution has a significant peak where a yellowish flame appears. To explain the experimental observations, a detailed gas-phase ammonium dinitramide–methanol reaction model is used to establish the flame structure of an ideal liquid propellant, which can be divided into several different regions, including the liquid phase, aerosol zone, and two flame zones. The decomposition of ammonium dinitramide and the evaporation of methanol take place in the liquid phase and aerosol zone, whereas the gas phase reactions of methanol and the decomposition products of ammonium dinitramide take place in the two flame zones. Based on the proposed theory of flame structure, it is seen that, in our experiment, the physical and chemical processes in the liquid phase and aerosol zone are completed upstream of the catalyst bed, and the unstable yellowish flame appearing in the combustion chamber is caused by competitive influence between the two flame zones.",34,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36880,"In spite of its crucial importance, conjugate heat transfer has been ignored in most film-hole-array optimization studies due to the burdensome associated with added complexity and computational requirements. To cope with this issue and to consider the conduction cooling effects, the hierarchical kriging model was applied to optimize the film-cooling hole array on a high-pressure turbine nozzle. The hierarchical kriging model used in this study consists of three levels and was constructed effectively using both adiabatic-condition-based analyses and conjugate-heat-transfer analyses. The expected-improvement-based efficient global optimization algorithm was coupled with the hierarchical kriging model to improve the efficiency of the whole optimization process. As a result, the required computation time to obtain the optimum solution was markedly reduced to a quarter compared to the time without the hierarchical kriging model, and the viability of the method for highly nonlinear and time-consuming problems was proved. Additionally, the conjugate-heat-transfer-based optimum film-hole array showed that it has improved the overall cooling effectiveness and could have a different shape compared to the array obtained under the adiabatic wall condition. The detailed causes of the resultant hole arrangement were thoroughly examined with respect to both the external and internal cooling aspects.",34,5

This paper presents an aerodynamic analysis of civil aeroengine exhaust systems through the use of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics. Two different numerical approaches are implemented, and the numerical predictions are compared to measured data from an experimental high-bypass-ratio separate-jet exhaust system. Over a fan nozzle pressure ratio range from 1.4 to 2.8, a comparison is drawn between values of the thrust coefficient calculated numerically and those obtained from experimental measurements. In addition, the effects of the freestream Mach number and extraction ratio on the aerodynamic behavior of the exhaust system are quantified and correlated to fundamental aerodynamic parameters.",34,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36927,"Unstable combustion was observed in a dual-chamber combustor that mimics heavy-duty gas engines utilizing prechamber jet ignition. Prechamber combustion generated a hot turbulent jet that ignited the ultra-lean mixture in the main chamber. Thermoacoustic combustion instability was initiated for main-chamber equivalence ratio, , and grew severe in the lean-burn regime, . Simultaneous schlieren and chemiluminescence were used to visualize the unstable flame propagation and to characterize the instability. Classical acoustic resonator analysis and pressure spectra showed the longitudinal mode of acoustic disturbance as the primary instability mode for all equivalence ratios. However, a leaner flame was affected more due to stronger coupling between heat release and the pressure field perturbation. Transverse and mixed modes were observed at lean conditions, . A phase-resolved measurement of strain rates along flame edge showed an oscillating strain along pressure perturbation cycle. To model the instability, 3D linearized Euler equations were solved in the frequency domain coupled with combustion response models. The physical significance of the instability modes and their behavior were identified using dynamic mode decomposition. Based on the experimental and modeling results, a mechanism for thermoacoustic instability was proposed for ultra-lean premixed ignition by a hot turbulent jet.",34,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36765,"This paper discusses a novel and detailed approach for dynamic modeling and control design of a coupled hydraulic dynamometer/turbine-engine system. This study presents a comprehensive model to reveal the coupling effects and an adaptive multiobjective controller to ensure a safe and reliable operation. A fuzzy-based strategy is employed to dynamically adjust the controller gains to keep the state variables and power loading within the desirable operational limits. This approach uses the dynamometer inlet, outlet, and trim valves as well as the turbine fuel flow rate and bleed valve in order to control the system performance during the engine testing process. The proposed fuzzy control strategy, in comparison with traditional techniques, promises to greatly improve the test quality in terms of time, cost, and risk reduction.",34,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36949,"A high length-to-diameter ratio of a rocket leads to unstable flight performance, affects structural loads, and makes a high dry mass of the rocket with a diameter constraint. To improve the volumetric efficiency of the fuel, a multiport design with optimum ratio was considered by adjusting the number of ports and diameter while decreasing the length. To optimize the ratio, the final port diameter was predicted, and the arrangement of the ports to prevent the merging of the ports was considered. The length of the fuel content was reduced to 30% when the number of ports was 14, compared with the single-port fuel. The experimental result showed a slight decrease in the ratio with the increased number of ports and reduced length of fuel at the same oxidizer mass flow rate, and the characteristic velocity efficiency increased. Peak-to-peak pressure amplitude in the prechamber was calculated to compare the effect on the amplitude of the multiport fuels. The application of the simple cylindrical multiport design reduces the length-to-diameter ratio of the hybrid thruster and improves rocket combustion performance.",34,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36917,"The combustion characteristics of propellants heavily affect the performance of solid-propellant air-turbo rockets (SP-ATRs). In this study, an SP-ATR experimental combustion system was developed, and experimental studies were conducted on the primary and secondary combustion characteristics of two solid hydrocarbon fuel propellants. The results show that the solid hydrocarbon fuel-rich propellant, which is an ideal propellant for SP-ATRs, can play the dual role of driving the turbines and executing secondary combustion. The studies on the two candidate propellants show that CH01 has higher energy characteristics, and CH02 exhibits better performance in terms of the interior ballistic stability and ejection efficiency. For cold inflow conditions, when the fuel gas flow rate is at the optimum equivalence ratio, there are difficulties in secondary combustion. A combustion experiment with a variable gas flow rate was designed, and the upper limit of the excess air coefficient was obtained under the condition of cold inflow.",34,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36846,"Polytetrafluoroethylene is known to enhance the reactivity of aluminum. The enhancement in the reactivity is produced by mechanically activating the aluminum using polytetrafluoroethylene. In this study, mechanically activated aluminum powder is used along with paraffin wax as the fuel grain for a hybrid propellant. Here, gaseous oxygen is used as oxidizer. To achieve an optimum composition for the best specific impulse, the aluminum fraction in the composition is restricted to 50% of the base fuel composition along with 50% wax/ethylene vinyl acetate (combination of wax and ethylene vinyl acetate, in a ratio of ). The polytetrafluoroethylene in mechanically activated aluminum powder is added at the expense of wax/ethylene vinyl acetate in the fuel composition. When compared with the composition having pyral aluminum powder (which has flake like particles of very high specific surface area), mechanically activated powder increases the fuel regression rate by at an oxidizer mass flux of -s. It is also observed that the combustion efficiency of the hybrid motor is 59% with the use of mechanically activated aluminum powder in comparison to 39% obtained with micron-sized aluminum powder.",34,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36768,"Hot-flow testings with subscale dual-bell nozzle models were conducted. The primary nozzle model had a relatively large initial expansion angle in the extension nozzle section. The propellant was liquid oxygen and gaseous methane. Wall distributions of pressure, temperature, and heat flux distributions along the extension nozzle were measured to characterize the effect of the mixture ratio and combustion chamber pressure on the separation transition. The wall pressure for the primary test model indicated that the separation transition took place at nearly a constant nozzle pressure ratio and independently of the mixture ratio. Differently, a test model with a smaller expansion angle, which was also tested for a comparison, showed that the separation transition took place dependently on the mixture ratio. Comparison of the separation transition condition with some existing criteria found that one of the causes of the dependency on the mixture ratio was related to the separation pressure in the inflection region. Additionally, strong hysteresis was observed for the test model with a smaller extension angle. The heat flux transducer data indicated that the wall heat flux at the inflection point at the separation transition had a linear relationship with the mixture ratio.",34,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36788,"An experimental investigation into the correlation between ion acoustic turbulence (IAT) and anomalous ion heating in the plume of a 100 A-class hollow cathode is presented. Laser-induced fluorescence is employed to measure the ion velocity distribution function, and a translating ion saturation probe is used to quantify the spatial dependence of the IAT wave energy. It is found that over a range of flow rates and operating currents both the ion temperature and IAT energy increase downstream of the cathode in qualitatively similar ways. Both parameters also are shown to be impacted by operating conditions: the IAT energy and ion temperature decrease at higher flow rates and lower discharge currents. It is shown that the ratio between ion temperature and wave energy is related by a scaling parameter that depends on the background plasma parameters, and this relation is examined in the context of previous analytical work on IAT-induced ion heating.",34,5

One challenge in assessing the performance of iodine-based thrusters has been a of lack spectroscopic schemes for measuring the iodine ion exhaust velocity and flux distribution in the plume. A new laser-induced fluorescence scheme is demonstrated for singly ionized atomic iodine (I II). The hyperfine structure of the and states used in the scheme is apparent, and likely values of the magnetic dipole hyperfine coefficients are presented for both electronic states.",34,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36906,"In this work, an efficient model is proposed to predict the complicated coupling behavior of a pyroshock-reduced separation nut, which has two variable-volume chambers connected by the vent hole. The model considers the effect of mutual interactions between combustion products and internal moving parts of the separation nut. To accomplish this, governing equations for combustion modeling are systematically derived, assuming that the flowfield within each chamber is homogeneous. For internal moving parts of the separation nut, the equations of motion are constructed. The equations are used to construct a coupled model. The behavior of the model from solving the system of differential equations is obtained, based on the Dormand–Prince embedded Runge–Kutta method. To validate the model, its behavior is compared with the test results of an actual prototype. Furthermore, modeling effects of the condensed phase product and initial air are investigated, and their significance in combustion modeling is identified. Parametric studies are then carried out to investigate the effects of the design parameters on the separation behavior. The results indicate that the model could be used efficiently in the design of separation nuts.",34,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37081,"Green liquid monopropellant thrusters provide an alternative to toxic hydrazine. A premixed liquid monopropellant based on hydrogen peroxide with ethanol blending was suggested to replace hydrazine in this research. The maximum theoretical vacuum specific impulse was 282 s for a certain mixture ratio. A 10-N-scale monopropellant thruster was used for performance evaluation. Platinum with porous gamma-phase alumina support was used as a catalyst. A preliminary firing test was performed for 5 s with propellant A, which had 181 s of vacuum specific impulse. Catalytic combustion occurred without an additional igniter with 87.7% of efficiency in a preliminary firing test. Propellant B, which had 214 s of vacuum specific impulse and of vacuum density specific impulse, was selected as an alternative to hydrazine. A thruster firing test was performed for 5 s, the efficiency was measured as 95.3%, and the chamber-pressure oscillation was approximately . To reduce combustion instability, lanthanum hexaaluminate (a high-thermal-resistant catalyst support) was applied in an additional firing test. The pressure oscillation was measured as , with 92.8% of efficiency in an additional firing test. These results demonstrated the feasibility of an ethanol-blended hydrogen peroxide thruster as a high-performance and green-propellant thruster for space missions.",34,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36913,"This paper outlines updates made to a method for chemical kinetic model reduction for use in computational fluid dynamics simulations. Specifically, this method uses a time-integrated flux-based algorithm to find a small skeletal model based on a detailed kinetic model, before optimization of the rate constants, using steepest descent and solution mapping methods. The new method is then applied to the reduction of a methane–air model and a dodecane–air model for two different sets of initial conditions. The results show that the optimized models are able to predict the performance of their respective detailed models over the ranges of conditions for which the optimizations are based. Results for the optimized models are also able to predict the perfectly stirred reactor response better than the optimized models generated using the older method.",34,5
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36842,"The turbulent reacting flow in an industrial gas turbine combustor operating at 3 bar is computed using the large-eddy simulation paradigm. The subgrid-scale combustion is modeled using a collection of unstrained premixed flamelets including mixture stratification. The nonpremixed combustion mode is also included using a simple closure involving the scalar dissipation rate of the mixture fraction. Close attention is paid to maintain physical consistencies among subclosure models for combustion, and these consistencies are discussed on a physical basis. The importance of the nonpremixed mode and subgrid-scale mixture fraction fluctuations are investigated systematically. The results show that the subgrid-scale mixture fraction variance plays an important role and comparisons to measurements improve when contributions from the premixed and nonpremixed modes are included. These numerical results and observations are discussed on a physical basis along with potential avenues for further improvements.",34,5
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36802,"The ignition delay times of propellants provide insight for the fundamental understanding of the ignition process. This study demonstrated a refined method to measure the of ammonium-perchlorate-based propellants at pressures between 3.5 and 15.5 MPa. Both aluminized and nonaluminized ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene composite propellants were studied with and without metal oxide nanoparticle catalysts. A laser was used to obtain quantifiable and reliable ignition times over a 30–100 W power range. The results were compared to literature values for similar power fluxes at comparable pressures and to a simple ignition model based on heat conduction. Catalytic additives were seen to modify the , depending primarily on whether they impact the lower- or higher-temperature decomposition of ammonium perchlorate. Examining the effects of in situ titania nanoparticles on the ignition delay times led to the conclusion that the nano-additives only altered the ignition behavior of the aluminized samples, but had no effect on the nonaluminized ones. Conversely, when nano-sized was used, the was halved at lower pressures. As a result, additives that assist in the low-temperature decomposition of ammonium perchlorate, such as , are believed to have the greatest impact on ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene ignition delay times.",34,5
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36131,"An air-breathing electric propulsion system is regarded as a potential alternative propulsion system to the propeller system for near-space vehicles. The goal of this paper is to study the performance of an air-breathing electric thruster based on the single dielectric barrier discharge technology. The generated thrust was measured for various ambient pressures and voltage amplitudes. The results show a nonmonotonic relation between the pressure and the thrust and that the power-law dependence between the voltage and the thrust exists at different pressures. Experiments were also conducted to investigate the effect of both the electrode geometries and the dielectric parameters on the thruster’s performance, indicating that smaller electrode spacing, thinner dielectric, and larger relative permittivity of dielectric can lead to larger thrust in the low-pressure applications, whereas the width of the exposed electrode hardly has an effect. Furthermore, qualitative analyses were performed to explore the internal mechanisms.",34,5
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37019,"The present work is aimed at studying the interfacial debonding behavior between the hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid propellant and liner. The fracture mechanics method based on integral was used to evaluate the interface’s resistance against crack initiation and propagation, with the auxiliaries of the multisample test procedure and high-speed camera. The discrete fracture parameters at different interfacial-crack initiation moments and crack extension amounts, including the load, displacement, and fracture energy, were well fitted using the least-squares method and the second-order polynomial regression method. The crack blunting process was observed to fit the blunting line realistically. The 95% confidence intervals of fracture parameters were obtained by conducting the regression error analyses based on the -distribution to include the experimental uncertainties. The mean value of the crack initiation integral, , was obtained. The mean value of the apparent initiation fracture toughness, , was determined by combining the blunting line and -integral-based resistance curve. The regression result of was characterized by a narrower 95% confidence interval compared with the one of . Further, the interfacial-debonding mechanism and its influence on the overall failure were investigated.",34,5
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36717,"The characterization of nozzle heat flux at extreme conditions has been a subject of investigation for a long time. Because of the complexity of the multiple processes involved, including a coupling of turbulent fluid flow, heat transfer, and combustion, designers of similar systems have largely relied on empirical and semi-empirical correlations. However, some of these correlations lead to inaccuracies in the design process. The current study presents the analysis of a combustor that could be used in a direct power extraction (DPE) configuration. The combustor produces flame temperatures of 3300 K and heat fluxes greater than . In this paper, analytical and two-dimensional numerical heat flux values and temperatures are compared with experimental results. Results show that analytical methods using Bartz correlation with a 40% reduction of the heat transfer coefficient produce similar results to a much more complicated coupled Navier–Stokes–based model. Both methods match with experimental results to within 2.8% for coolant heat absorption and 2.5% for the chamber-region channel wall temperature prediction. The analytical model presented in this paper can be employed in other scenarios that use incompressible fluids as coolants, where stratification effects are reduced.",34,5

The thruster performances are deduced, and the influence of power and mass-flow rate is studied. The measured thrust is around 1 mN for 50 W of microwave power input and of xenon, corresponding to 1000 s of specific impulse and 11% of total efficiency. It is found that the thrust is increased by 25% when the walls of the plasma source are covered with a dielectric layer.

25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37108,"Analyses of dual-model scramjet engines often rely on the assumption of thermally perfect gas, for which the internal modes of molecular motion are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium. With an increase in enthalpy and in the presence of shocks and expansion waves, the equilibrium assumption does not hold within a scramjet inlet-isolator section. For the flight Mach numbers considered here, the molecular vibrational modes are affected, leading to not only a change in the gas properties but a redistribution of the total energy. In this work, a multitemperature model is used to describe thermal nonequilibrium of flow through a square duct with an inlet Mach number of 1.9. The highly resolved simulations show that the pseudoshock structure is altered due to nonequilibrium, with the leading edge of the shock structure moving upstream. Moreover, the length of the pseudoshock is considerably increased. Both of these effects are shown to be caused by slow relaxation of the molecules. Furthermore, even at the isolator’s exit, equilibrium is not established, which is manifested as a pressure defect. If and when the fluid reaches thermal equilibrium, inside the downstream combustor, there is a potential for a sudden surge in local pressure that could endanger scramjet operation.",34,5
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37011,"An experimental investigation was conducted to study the combustion characteristics of aluminum and water, gelled using polyacrylamide as gelling agent. These propellants were tested for burn rates and residue in a Crawford bomb. The present study used flakelike aluminum particles with large specific surface area called pyral. Burn rates and residue were measured for oxidizer-to-fuel ratios (O/F) of 0.8, 1, and 1.2. Gelled propellants prepared with pyral had a maximum burn rate of at 60 bar pressure at an O/F of 0.8. However, these propellants had a very large residue of 70–80% of the initial mass. To overcome this, propellants were prepared with pyral, which was mechanically activated with polytetrafluoroethylene. The reduction in residue was mainly attributed to smaller thermal profile depth associated with mechanically activated aluminum and to the higher heat of combustion observed with such propellants. Through careful experimentation, the reason for the residue has been established to be due to heat loss from the sides of the propellant strand. The thermal conductivity and propellant diameter play a vital role in determining the heat loss from the condensed phase and in turn determining burn rates and residue.",34,5
