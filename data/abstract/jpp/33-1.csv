4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36082,"A computational fluid dynamics investigation of a pressure-gain combustor system for gas turbine applications is described. The system consists of a valved pulse combustor and an ejector, housed within a shroud. The computational fluid dynamics solver is first validated by comparing its output to experimental measurements done on a pulse combustor operating at sea-level static conditions. Subsequently, the combustor inlet pressure and temperature are increased in the simulations to more closely align with those seen downstream of a compressor. Several parameters that influence combustor performance are then varied in order to demonstrate the potential benefit of optimization efforts. Emissions calculations are also performed. It is found that efficient high-pressure operation is possible and that system pressure gain of nearly 3% (at gas turbine compatible combustor temperature ratios) is achievable, with nearly smooth exit flow, having a competitive emission index. The potential for pulse combustors to achieve ultra-low levels of emissions at high-pressure conditions is also demonstrated.",33,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36068,"A novel method for the operation of a pulse detonation combustor is proposed and demonstrated for realizing high frequencies without using a purging material. In the developed operation method, oxygen is supplied to the pulse detonation combustor in the valveless mode. Fuel, which is supercritical ethylene, is injected into the pulse detonation combustor at a suitable timing using an automotive fuel injector. Because of the Joule–Thomson effect, a phase transition of ethylene from the supercritical state to a low-temperature vapor occurs, and a detonable mixture is produced by mixing with oxygen. In demonstration experiments, a small pulse detonation combustor having an inner diameter of 10 mm, a total length of 190 mm, and an inner volume of 14.5 mL is used, and the operation frequency varies between 100 and 500 Hz. The measured flame propagation speeds are of the Chapman–Jouguet detonation speed. In addition, the operation frequency of 500 Hz is 41% of the gas-dynamic upper limit, which is obtained using the one-dimensional model proposed by Endo et al.",33,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36073,"This paper describes a new method for calculating the performance of pressure gain combustors for gas turbine applications. The method judges the value of a combustor based on the flow’s increased potential to do shaft work from combustor inlet to exit. This potential is defined as the work that could be extracted from the flow by a reversible adiabatic turbine exhausting to the combustor supply pressure. A new performance metric, the Rayleigh efficiency, is defined as the increased potential of the flow to do shaft work divided by the heat input. A novel control volume analysis is used, which directly links this performance metric to source terms within the combustor. Two primary source terms are shown: The first is a thermal creation term, which occurs in regions of the flow where combustion heat release occurs at pressures above that of the environment and acts to raise the flow’s potential to do shaft work. The term is a nonlinear analog of Lord Rayleigh’s acoustic energy creation term, from his 1878 thermoacoustic criterion. The second term is a viscous destruction term that always acts to reduce the flow’s potential to do shaft work. In the final part of the paper, the utility of the method is demonstrated using experimental measurements and computational predictions from a SNECMA (Société nationale d'études et de construction de moteurs d'aviation)/Lockwood-type valveless pulse combustor. The analysis enables a number of previously unanswered questions about pulse combustors to be answered.",33,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36078,"An acoustic method for analyzing the operation of valveless pulsejets is developed using a fluid–electrical analogy and transmission line theory. The analysis technique assumes that a valveless pulsejet is an acoustic duct with area and temperature varying along its length. The area and temperature are used as inputs to the calculation, and the outputs include operational frequency and axial pressure distributions in both space and time. Operating frequencies are predicted to within 6% of the experimental values for five different pulsejet configurations. The present analysis method is also compared to existing models in the literature, and the reasons for the successes and failures of previous approaches are explored.",33,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36088,"Cold starting a liquid-fuel pulse detonation engine with air as the oxidizer is always an unavoidable challenge because of the inherent insensitivity of droplet–air mixtures to undergo detonation initiation. The existing strategies are essentially attempts to accelerate the vaporization rates of liquid fuels to increase the amount of prevaporized fuel before ignition. In this paper, it has incidentally been discovered from experimental studies that a Jet A-1/air pulse detonation engine is able to operate successfully in relatively cold environments (mixture temperature at 70°C) when an excessively fuel-rich mixture is used. The experimental results and theoretical phase equilibrium calculations show that the vapor-phase equivalence ratio is vital for successful detonation initiation spray detonations via a deflagration-to-detonation transition process. For a two-phase mixture containing a high overall fraction of fuel as compared with air, the amount of vaporized fuel achieves a stoichiometric or slightly rich composition, which is easier to undergo detonation. This discovery can potentially be applied for the simple startup of a liquid-fuel pulse detonation engine without incorporating any auxiliary systems.",33,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36084,"The rotating detonation engine is a propulsion system that obtains thrust using continuously existing detonation waves. A rotating detonation combustor usually has an annular shape that allows detonation waves to propagate in the circumferential direction. In this study, we used a disk-shaped rotating detonation combustor with a combustion chamber with flat-plane glass walls to observe the structure of the phenomena. Self-luminescence, shadowgraphs, and schlieren visualization experiments were performed and compared. Results revealed that detonation waves were propagating in a mixture layer of three gases, fuel, oxidizer, and burned gas at 1600 to ; Chapman-Jouguet velocity was . Waves maintained a three-dimensional complicated wave shape in the disk-shaped combustion chamber with parallel-jet injectors.",33,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36103,"A method for modeling the internal flowfield in a rotating detonation engine is developed using shock-expansion theory combined with the steady two-dimensional isentropic method of characteristics. An analytical model using the oblique shock relations, the Prandtl–Meyer function, and the detonation jump conditions is used to determine the basic shock structure. Once the structure is known, a shock-fitted method of characteristics solution is marched out to generate the rest of the flowfield. Reactant injection is handled analytically by solving the conservation equations for a flow undergoing a sudden expansion along with the method of characteristics compatibility relations to provide a new boundary condition. A new solution is then initialized using information from the previous solution to calculate the new shock structure. This process is repeated until the solutions converge. The converged solution is the ideal steady-state solution of a rotating detonation engine in the wave-fixed reference frame. The goal of this model is to provide ideal performance estimates one step up from a basic thermodynamic model that are still fast enough for large parametric studies.",33,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36095,"Numerical simulations of three-dimensional rotating detonation engines for a hydrogen–oxygen mixture are performed using the detailed chemistry model. The grid-resolution study indicates that the cellular structure of the detonation appears near the inner wall as the circumferential grid resolution increases. However, the effects of the grid resolution are small on . The grid resolution for the high-mass-flow cases should be carefully considered because the rotating detonation velocity increases to produce higher thrust under the low grid resolution. As the annular width increases, a complicated shock structure such as a Mach stem appears, and the cycle time decreases. The effects of the annular width are small on . As the number of the rotating detonations increases, the asymmetric detonation heads rotate along the circumferential direction with the same cycle time after 30 cycles. for the two-waved rotating detonation engine decreases approximately 10% less than for the one-waved rotating detonation engine. This is because the injected mixture mass flow rate for the two-waved rotating detonation engine increases 16% larger than that for the one-waved rotating detonation engine, whereas the thrusts between them coincide.",33,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36195,"This paper summarizes experimental observations of pulsed combustion occurring in a 4.5 cm diameter, nozzleless rocket combustor for pressure gain combustion applications. The combustor featured an impinging jet injector and operated on high-concentration hydrogen peroxide with a catalyst-laced hydrocarbon-based fuel. Pressure oscillations in the 200–700 Hz range were found. For a 10 bar manifold pressure, peak-pressure responses exceeding 60 bar were recorded in the feed system. Transient propellant spray destruction and formation were observed through an optically accessible combustor section. The pulse combustion frequency was tightly tied to atomization, mixing, and hydrogen peroxide decomposition processes; furthermore, frequency was well correlated with the injection velocity for a given injector design. While a precise description is still lacking, the combustion of a mixture of decomposed hydrogen peroxide and fuel appears to be best described as a constant-volume combustion event.",33,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36164,"In this paper, OpenFoam, an open source unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes software was carefully examined to analyze rotating detonation combustors. This tool was subsequently used to quantify the effect of the outlet conditions on five different exhaust nozzle geometries. Both detonation and deflagration of the hydrogen–air mixture were taken into account in the source terms of the species transport equation. The premixed –air mixture was injected at three different total pressures, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 MPa. First, the rotating detonation combustor was described, and then five different nozzles were investigated: straight duct, conical, Bezier outer wall, Bezier inner wall, and two Bezier surfaces. All the nozzles were compared regarding their outlet total temperature, pressure gain, exit Mach number, and outlet flow angle. The use of a straight duct nozzle generated a noticeable drop in pressure gain of about 27% compared to the baseline combustor. The conical nozzle expanded the combustor outlet flow from sonic conditions into Mach 1.8 to 2.3. The Bezier outer wall underperformed compared to the conical nozzle at low combustor inlet pressures, while the situation was reversed at higher combustor inlet pressures. Using the inner wall as a divergent section showed no benefits in terms of Mach number and total pressure. The use of a nozzle with two Bezier surfaces did not provide any significant benefits in spite of the enhanced outlet-to-combustor-inlet-area ratio.",33,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36303,"Recent accomplishments related to the performance, application, and analysis of rotating detonation engine technologies are discussed. The pioneering development of optically accessible rotating detonation engines coupled with the application of established diagnostic techniques is enabling a new research direction. In particular, chemiluminescence images of detonations propagating through the annular channel of a rotating detonation engine are reported and appear remarkably similar to computational fluid dynamic results of rotating detonation engines published in the literature. Specific impulse measurements of rotating detonation engines and pulsed detonation engines are shown to be quantitatively similar for engines operating on hydrogen/air and ethylene/air mixtures. The encouraging results indicate that rotating detonation engines are capable of producing thrust with fuel efficiencies that are similar to those associated with pulsed detonation engines while operating on gaseous hydrocarbon fuels. A rotating detonation engine is coupled with a turboshaft engine for the first time. The performance of the rotating detonation engine gas turbine engine is similar to or better than that of the conventional gas turbine engine across a broad range of operating conditions. Realizing the advantages of pressure gain combustion in rotating detonation engines is enabling new combustion system design opportunities and supporting the development of efficient and sustainable power and propulsion technologies.",33,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36170,"A mass-flow model was developed to calculate the flow rates of a gaseous fuel and oxidizer injected intermittently into a pulse detonation engine. The procedure used the mass-flow parameter of the gas to estimate the ideal mass-flow rate. The ideal mass-flow rate calculation incorporated determination of the time-varying injection surface area, supply pressure, and temperature and specific heat ratio of the gas considering choked flow at the injecting surface. This value of ideal mass flow was multiplied by an experimentally determined discharge coefficient to account for losses. The calculated mass-flow rates and valve opening time duration were used to calculate the total mass of reactants injected per pulse for a typical pulse detonation engine. In addition, a scheme for the change in injection surface area for different types of valve openings was presented. Results indicated the practicality of the developed mass-flow model to calculate the intermittent gas mass injection into a pulse detonation engine. The results also showed that the experimentally determined discharge coefficient via steady-state calibration held true for valve operation at 1, 10, and 20 Hz.",33,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36169,"High-fidelity numerical simulations and their impact on the research and development of detonation-based, pressure-gain combustion devices are discussed in this paper. Both time-dependent one- and multidimensional simulations have been used to highlight the advantages and limitations of these approaches. The level of fidelity of the physical models is established by comparison to experimental data. The results of detailed, one-dimensional numerical simulations are generalized to identify three key factors that control the idealized performance of a pulse detonation engine device. Multidimensional detonation structure studies are used to explain the observed difficulty in the initiation and transmission of detonations in ethylene–air mixtures in pulse detonation engine devices. Then multidimensional simulations of rotating detonation engine device are used to describe the basic flow field within such a device. The key parameters that control the idealized performance of these devices are explored using the simulations. The effect of injection and exhaust geometry is also highlighted.",33,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36174,"Design and testing of a wave-rotor constant-volume combustor achieved stable combustion at near-atmospheric inlet conditions and demonstrated the potential of pressure-gain combustion using a wave rotor. An experiment rig with a motor-driven, room-temperature rotor with large thermal mass operated for short durations within heating limits of extensive in-passage rotating instrumentation. Over 30 successful tests were completed, including a 3 s run amounting to about 2000 individual firing events. Fast deflagrative combustion was observed with varied ethylene fuel distribution in the passages, showing good combustor operability, insensitive to leakage. Remarkably high flame speeds and a net pressure gain were indirectly indicated from measurements. A time-marching, spatially one-dimensional numerical model of gas dynamics and combustion was used for aerothermodynamic design, applying loss models previously calibrated with pressure-exchange nonreacting wave-rotor experiments. Major features and trends of the measured gas dynamic and combustion processes showed good agreement with predictions and validated current design methods. Different fuel distributions were tested to better calibrate ignition and combustion submodels. Simulations illustrate the likely explanations for cases with and without observed ignition, spillage during the filling process, and mixture requirements for consistent torch ignition. The viability of wave rotors for realizing a pressure-gain combustor is discussed.",33,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35999,"A series of tests are conducted to understand the basic features of the coupling mechanism of combustion pressure with the local heat release fluctuation upon the occurrence of low-frequency instability in a hybrid rocket engine. In stable combustion, combustion pressure fluctuates at the frequency of about 20 Hz because of the thermal lag of solid fuel burning. Also, there exist steady spatial distributions of heat release, which are similar to a shear-layer structure. However, when low-frequency instability occurs, the combustion pressure is amplified, and the luminosity starts to fluctuate at a frequency of about 20 Hz. More interestingly, a positive coupling is observed between two fluctuations. The radical luminosity images and proper orthogonal decomposition analysis show the lumped flow structures with time-varying intensity in unstable combustion. A periodic change in the local heat release appears to generate large-scale flow rotations, and the large-scale flow rotations are likely to be associated with the periodic flame extinction at a frequency of about 20 Hz. Also, the flame extinction seems to take a crucial role in the occurrence of low-frequency instability, although it is not clearly understood why the flame extinction occurs in the specific geometric configuration.",33,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35988,"Inducers are critical to the minimization of the degradation of liquid oxygen pumps and the maximization of the thrust-to-weight ratio of liquid rocket engines, but create cavitation instabilities that have adverse effects on their reliabilities. To examine the cavitation instabilities that arose during the development testing of a liquid oxygen pump that uses water and liquid oxygen as its working media, accelerometers were employed instead of pressure transducers, which are complicated to install. The supersynchronous rotating cavitation and asymmetric cavitation of the pump were characterized by analyzing the signals from the accelerometers, and these results were found to be in good agreement with those of previous studies. Supersynchronous rotating cavitation was found to occur in the tests of both propellants, whereas asymmetric cavitation was found to be dominant in the liquid oxygen test.",33,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36055,"Combustion instabilities arise from interactions between the acoustic field and unsteady heat release within a confined chamber. In the present study, a three-dimensional acoustic model is developed to explore the effect of azimuthally nonuniform distribution of heat release on longitudinal combustion instabilities. The governing equations are solved by means of a spectral collocation method with domain decomposition to accommodate the flow discontinuities across the flame. It is shown that the circumferential nonuniformity in heat release has only a marginal effect on instability frequency but may cause a potentially significant decrease in the growth rate. For some combinations of flow parameters, a high degree of heat-release asymmetry may qualitatively change the stability characteristics of the combustor, with a sign change of the growth rate. It is found that vorticity waves produced by the azimuthally nonuniform heat release may contribute damping to the thermoacoustic system.",33,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36036,"The two-stage combustion hybrid rocket engine with a hybrid gas generator method offers numerous advantages over a solid-propellant gas generator and classical hybrid rocket engines. These advantages include a higher specific impulse in operation, lower lifecycle costs, and lower sensitivity to combustion pressure. This study was mainly designed to discover whether the fuel-rich effluent coming out from the hybrid gas generator was generated to meet the temperature requirement of less than 1300 K. By using parameters such as oxidizer-to-fuel ratios, oxidizer mass flow rates, grain dimensions, and fuel types, experimental tests were attempted the temperature change in the effluent. This study also examined the combustion sensitivity of each parameter to different equivalence ratios and the combustion behavior of each parameter to different temperatures. In the results, a combustion temperature as low as 1290 K was successfully achieved in the fuel-rich combustion of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene with a mixture oxidizer containing 28% oxygen. The results also suggested that, when adding ammonium perchlorate to the hybrid gas generator, it helped improve the operational performance by reducing oxidizer-to-fuel variations and provided more uniform radial temperature profiles.",33,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36152,"The aim of this investigation was to perform a parametric computational study of the blockerless engine thrust reverser system concept. Early experimental investigations had revealed that injection flow rates of the order of 3% of the fan flow were needed to divert the entire fan flow out through the cascade opening. For a high bypass ratio engine, this amount was too much to be bled from the compressor. This study performs a more detailed evaluation of the concept and covers cases that could not be tested during the experimental investigation due to the limitations of experimental facility. A numerical model simulating the experimental setup was constructed, and effects of various design parameters such as injection location, injection angle, injection thickness, cascade opening, and operational parameters such as fan flow and injection flow rates were studied using trajectory-based analysis. The results suggest that the injection location and injection angle have a profound effect on the performance, and injection flow rates of less than 1.5% could easily divert the entire fan flow through the cascade opening by optimizing parameters of interest.",33,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36121,"The flutter CFD calculations conducted in industry generally use a single-row, single-passage approach with a minimum of detailing to reduce the computational time as much as possible. The question arises of what level of detailing is necessary for accurate aerodamping predictions. In this study, the influence of tip clearance size on the steady flowfield and aerodynamic damping is assessed for a high-pressure compressor second-stage rotor. The steady analyses are conducted on an isolated blade passage by imposing the experimental boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the passage. Two operating points are considered: 74 and 100% corrected speed. It is observed that, at the same pressure ratio, the mass flow decreases with a larger tip gap due to the tip clearance flow rolling into a vortex on the blade suction side. Then, unsteady analyses are conducted by enforcing the first torsion mode shape at the corresponding natural frequency. For all interblade phase angles, the same trend is observed: the damping first increases (stabilizing effect) with the tip clearance before reaching a maximum and dropping for the larger gaps. Such changes in damping would have a significant impact on both flutter and forced response predictions.",33,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35968,"A high-fidelity yet affordable design procedure is proposed for a film-cooling hole array optimization and subsequently applied to the array on the nozzle pressure side of the high-pressure turbine. To make this possible, the efficient array shape parameterization method combined with the efficient global optimization method is introduced. As a result of optimization, the average and variation of the wall temperature are reduced by approximately 10 and 25%, respectively. Also, it is confirmed from the results that the superior cooling performance is obtained when the array has smaller hole distances at the hub rather than at the shroud and when the array is disposed on the upstream position rather than on the downstream position. Finally, it is concluded that the performance improvement due to the optimized hole array amounts to the equivalent effects of increasing cooling air by 1.66% of the main passage mass flow.",33,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35981,"Blade-row interactions drive unsteady blade forces in compressors. This paper presents a perspective on understanding how the pitchwise variations in the flow at the exit of the rotor affect the surface pressures on the downstream vane. The rotor wakes and tip leakage flows are the primary unsteady flow features that drive unsteady lift on the vane. However, those rotor flow features are affected by their interaction with the wakes from upstream vanes. Thus, the interaction with stator 1 and rotor 2 must be understood to adequately characterize the interaction between rotor 2 and stator 2. This paper uses vane clocking, or the circumferential shift in successive vane rows of similar counts, to illuminate these blade-row interaction effects on the downstream vane surface pressure distribution. To accomplish this, experiments are performed in a three-stage axial compressor where high-frequency response pressure transducers are flush-mounted in the stator 2 pressure and suction surfaces are flush-mounted at 50 and 80% spans. Results show that rotor 1–rotor 2 interactions contribute significantly to the changes in unsteady stator surface pressure over the course of a rotor revolution. Also, the rotor 1–rotor 2 interaction levels change in the pitchwise direction downstream of the rotor; thus, the changes in surface pressure are affected by vane clocking. Furthermore, the rotor tip leakage flow is an additional contributor to the unsteady stator surface pressures measured at 80% span, providing an additional pressure peak per blade passing, and thus more high-frequency content (twice the blade-passing frequency).",33,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36236,"Ignition in a supersonic hydrogen–air mixing layer interacting with an oblique shock wave is investigated analytically under conditions such that the postshock flow is supersonic and the peak postshock temperature before ignition remains below the crossover temperature. The study requires consideration of the flow structure in the postshock ignition kernel found around the point of maximum temperature, which is assumed in this study to lie at an intermediate location across the mixing layer, as occurs in mixing layers subject to significant viscous dissipation. The ignition kernel displays a balance between the rates of chemical reaction and postshock flow expansion, including the acoustic interactions of the chemical heat release with the shock wave leading to increased front curvature. The problem is formulated with account taken of the strong temperature dependence of the chemical heat-release rate characterizing the ignition chemistry in the low-temperature regime analyzed here. It is shown how consideration of a two-step reduced chemical–kinetic mechanism derived in previous work leads to a boundary-value problem that can be solved analytically to determine ignition as a fold bifurcation, with the turning point in the diagram of peak perturbation induced by the chemical reaction as a function of the Damköhler number providing the critical conditions for ignition.",33,1
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35847,"Ion thruster plumes are simulated under a framework that was recently developed to take advantage of the large scalability of unstructured grids using adaptive mesh refinement. Momentum and charge-exchange collisions occurring between neutral and ion species, as well as the induced electric field due to ions, have been performed using multiple adaptive mesh refinement meshes to study the backflow of an ion thruster to a spacecraft surface. Furthermore, the ions and neutral species are directly coupled, which is found to have a 15% effect on the neutral species velocity profiles. The backflow for ions is found to occur when charge-exchange and momentum-exchange collisions are present, and then it is strongly enhanced when the induced electric field is considered. The ion energy distributions in the backflow region are obtained, and it is found that the inclusion of the electric field modeling is the most important factor in determining its shape. The plume backflow structure is also examined for a triple-thruster three-dimensional geometry case, and it is found that the ion velocity in the backflow region appears to be roughly independent of the number of thrusters. Finally, the influence of solar cell panel voltage on backflow fluxes is evaluated using a combined commercial software-generated potential with the induced potential, and the influence of gas–surface interactions is studied.",33,1

A modification to the original subframe-burst gating diagnostics system enables parallel detection of both polarized and depolarized Raman components for the first time in a high-pressure flame tube, which permits signal detection with reduced background noise, and consequently more precise determination of temperature and species in optically harsh flames. This technique is applied to the measurement of mass fractions of the major species and temperature in a swirl-stabilized hydrogen-methane flame at an elevated pressure of 15.5 bar. The single-shot linear Raman spectra are reduced to provide quantitative multiscalar information throughout the primary reaction zone. The experimental dataset is plotted along with the laminar flamelet calculations for different Lewis numbers and strain rates to allow better interpretation. Time-dependent analysis of the recorded samples using cross correlations, probability density functions, and scatter plots reveals the characteristic behavior of the quantities over a range of mixture fractions, including the local flame structure and the influence of turbulence–chemistry interactions.",33,1
