0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36300,"With future gas turbine designs seeking increased overall pressure ratios, blade heights in the rear stages of high-pressure compressors are expected to decrease. As this will lead to an increase of relative tip-clearance height, detailed knowledge of the associated rotor tip-leakage flows becomes increasingly important. In particular, the development of blockage due to large tip-leakage flows can be a key component leading to an understanding of stage matching for multistage machines. To assess blockage related to increased tip clearance, a series of measurements are presented here from a three-stage axial compressor at two loading conditions on the 100% corrected speed line. These data correspond to three tip-clearance configurations, up to 4% span. Three-component velocity measurements are used to validate a new blockage calculation technique based on measured steady and time-resolved pressures, and instrumentation techniques that are more robust and require fewer resources than multicomponent velocity tests. Ultimately, these simplified pressure-based blockage calculation techniques yield results that compare well with the velocity-based results, within 2% flow area or better.",34,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36542,"The three-dimensional simulation under consideration is related to the supersonic combustion of hydrogen with oxygen. The application under study corresponds to the early phase of ignition in a rocketlike engine. The configuration is a sonic jet of hot burned gases underexpanding into a combustion chamber filled with gaseous hydrogen. Two- and three-dimensional simulations are performed to assess the numerical strategy, define the mesh requirements, and to assist in the choice of the kinetic scheme for hydrogen/oxygen combustion. The large-eddy simulation tool is used with a reduced chemistry (five species and three global steps) on a mesh resolution fine enough to use the laminar model assumption (, 680 million points). The Pope criterion and a subgrid-scale Damköhler number are provided with various definitions for the Damköhler number to validate the retained procedure for three-dimensional simulations. The sequence of ignition is detailed, revealing the flame behavior and shock arrangements. A diffusion flame develops in the supersonic mixing layer formed by the igniter flow and hydrogen injections. The flame structure is recovered with a counterflow flame configuration. A comparison with a nonreacting case shows that the driving physical mechanism is mainly linked to the aerodynamics of the igniter jet.",34,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36364,"Rotor tip clearance height and the associated tip leakage flow have a significant effect on the performance and stability of compressors. Existing studies considering tip clearance effects on stability have been primarily limited to low-speed compressors, and many of these evaluated single-stage machines, which may not adequately represent stall trends for engine-scale compressors. Furthermore, test campaigns for engine-scale compressors cannot provide instrumentation accessibility required for detailed stage performance and stall investigations. Using results collected from a three-stage intermediate-speed axial compressor with appreciable density rise, this study addresses these needs. In this paper, three rotor tip clearances are tested, ranging from 1.5 to 4% span (1 to 3% chord). Previous studies have primarily shown a transition from short-length-scale spikes to long-length-scale modes as the clearance is increased, whereas the present study shows the opposite: a transition from modes to spikes with increased tip clearance. As a result, these data emphasize that a definitive trend does not exist between the stall inception mechanism and increasing tip clearance. Instead, the clearance effects alter stage matching with speed and change the stall inception mechanism. These results also elicit future research by preliminarily suggesting that stall inception mechanisms may be predictable from steady performance measurements collected in the stalling stage.",34,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36589,"The relative weight of convective and radiative wall heat transfer in liquid rocket engine thrust chambers is estimated by means of dedicated computational fluid dynamics tools. In particular, although the convective wall heat flux is directly evaluated from the solution of the flowfield, an appropriate computational tool, based on the discrete transfer method, is developed to evaluate the radiative wall heat flux. Numerical results are compared against experimental data from the literature, concerning sub-scale thrust chambers fed with either oxygen/methane or oxygen/hydrogen. Then, the effect of varying the chamber pressure or the wall temperature is investigated via a parametric analysis. Results indicate a contribution of radiation up to 15% of the total wall heat flux for oxygen/methane and up to 11% for oxygen/hydrogen propellants.",34,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36648,"A twin-jet configuration is composed of two jets placed in closed proximity to each other. Previous works on such configurations have been mostly experimental in nature. The aim of this work is to computationally analyze a twin-jet configuration and identify the impact of plume interactions on various aspects, such as shear-layer characteristics, coherent structures, mixing, and the near acoustic field. A large-eddy simulation (LES)-based approach is employed to study a Mach 1.23 circular twin-jet configuration with an internozzle spacing of two jet diameters. In agreement with the established literature, results indicate a dominant helical mode on both the jet plumes. In the internozzle region, mean velocity profiles indicate the formation of a secondary flow, which extends a significant influence on the shear layers in its proximity. However, this impact is confined to small azimuthal angles and, as a result, many of the potential core properties are almost similar to those of a single jet at identical flow conditions. Along the plane containing the jet centers, analysis of the near-field pressure fluctuations reveals that the twin jet exhibits suppressed levels relative to a single jet. This is ascribed to twin-jet plume bending along with reduced outer shear-layer spreading rate.",34,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36422,"Engine/airframe integration in advanced aircraft concepts must account for nonuniform flows ingested by turbofan engines. In this work, flow details from a vane-based distortion generator were analyzed for turbulence structure and aerodynamic scaling of the mean flow. Experimental results were obtained using particle image velocimetry in a small-scale facility and a full-scale research turbofan engine for the same vane geometry. Tests were performed at nearly the same Mach number to isolate Reynolds number effects, but analysis and prior work indicate that the flow development downstream of the vanes is Mach number independent in the subsonic regime. As hypothesized from inviscid vortex dynamics, the secondary mean flow angles were consistent across scales, indicating Reynolds number independence of the large-scale secondary flow profile generated. Vane wakes produced a complex structure in the streamwise velocity component not seen in the streamwise vorticity, which resembles the distribution from the desired secondary flow profile. The most intense turbulence is concentrated in the outer radial regions of the duct and, as shown by contrast to vane wake-dominated regions, is dominated by shear flow turbulence and unsteadiness due to the distortion profile itself rather than vane wakes. Taken together, these results provide fundamental understanding of the aerodynamics of swirling flows needed for implementing complex turning vanes in the design of distortion generators.",34,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36516,"Longitudinal combustion instability in liquid-propellant rocket engines is investigated using an in-house axisymmetric, multispecies compressible flow solver. Turbulence is treated using a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation approach. The combustion–turbulence interactions are modeled using the flamelet/progress-variable approach. The computational time is at least an order of magnitude smaller than existing axisymmetric simulations with a more detailed chemistry mechanism. Three flow configurations with a choked nozzle are studied: unstable cases with 12 and 14 cm oxidizer post lengths, and a semiunstable case with a 9 cm oxidizer port length. Numerical results for oscillation frequencies and amplitudes agree with the continuously variable resonance combustor experiments conducted at Purdue University. Good agreements with existing computational results are also found. An additional open-end constant-pressure simulation with (otherwise) the same configuration as the continuously variable resonance combustor experiment with the 14 cm oxidizer post is performed, yielding minor acoustic oscillation. The open-end vortex-shedding frequency is found to be roughly one-half of the frequency of vortex shedding calculated in the continuously variable resonance combustor configuration. The flame region compacts as the combustion chamber becomes more unstable. The choked nozzle allows large-amplitude oscillation, thereby enhancing mixing and leading to more complete combustion near the pressure antinode (combustion chamber entrance) as compared to the open-end chamber. Pulse timing in the unstable case is identified as a major factor for the instability mechanism. Oscillatory behaviors for all three instability domains are described.",34,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36593,"To seek the optimum heat release and inner configuration of a supersonic combustor, a strategy was proposed to address the coupling optimization problem in an infinite-dimensional function space. The total pressure recovery coefficient of the combustor was chosen as the objective function to minimize the entropy increment, which also corresponded to the performance limit of a supersonic combustor. With properly defined boundary conditions and necessary constraints, the problem was formulated and solved using optimal control theory. The results of the optimum heat release and inner configuration of a supersonic combustor were provided, and the influences of important factors were analyzed.",34,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36623,"This paper compares flow structures in a single- and triple-nozzle swirl combustor. Realistic combustor hardware usually contains several nozzles; however, test facilities for studying flame dynamics commonly use one nozzle. As such, it is important to determine how nozzle–nozzle interactions influence the dynamics of the system. Simultaneous 5 kHz OH planar laser-induced fluorescence and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements were obtained from a premixed, swirling methane–air flame. Time-averaged flowfields of the single- and triple-nozzle configurations are compared, showing agreement in the axial velocities and flow spreading angles. However, the comparison reveals nonnegligible differences in reverse flow velocities of the recirculation zone and in flame spreading angles. The paper then compares the response of the unsteady flowfield to transverse acoustic excitation, for two configurations that excite strong axisymmetric and helical shear-layer disturbances. These disturbances exhibit similar spatial growth and decay trends as well as nearly identical convection speeds upstream of the jet merging region. These results corroborate previous findings, which show that, despite differences in time-averaged quantities, comparable flow dynamics occur in single- and multinozzle swirl flames.",34,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36412,The startup of in-orbit rocket engines using cryogenic propellants is characterized by near-vacuum conditions leading to rapid flash evaporation of liquid oxidizer or fuel before ignition. The evolution of a flashing oxygen spray as well as the interaction with a coaxial gaseous methane injection is studied and compared to experiments using numerical methods. A flash evaporation model for superheated cryogenic droplets using an Euler–Lagrange method is implemented into a computational fluid dynamics solver. A simplified droplet flash evaporation model is used to calculate the coupling between Eulerian and Lagrangian phases with their respective source terms.,34,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36687,"A model of thermal ignition by dual-pulse laser energy addition is presented in this paper. The concept of controllable energy deposition is analyzed, assuming the first low-energy short-pulse-length laser serves to preionize a well-localized region without significant optical breakdown and the second time-delayed longer-pulse-length high-energy laser pulse illuminates that region. The delayed long pulse initiates combustion within the region designated by the short prepulse. This arrangement allows tailoring of the energy deposition, gas heating, and ignition at a specific location. The mathematical model is formulated by incorporating balanced equations for electrons, ions, neutrals, electron temperature, vibrational temperature, and the total gas energy taking into account the plasma chemistry combined with the low-temperature oxidation mechanism of methane and the GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism. The model is used to analyze the role of different heating mechanisms and initial conditions associated with the second pulse, as well as to evaluate the initial ionization requirements for successful ignition by the dual-pulse configuration.",34,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36610,"This paper presents a recent enhancement of the Open National Combustion Code (OpenNCC) and applies it to model a realistic combustor configuration, Energy Efficient Engine . First, a series of validation tests for the newly implemented advection upstream splitting method (AUSM) and the extended version of the AUSM-family schemes (-up) is performed. In comparison with the analytical/experimental data of the validation tests, good agreement is achieved. For steady-state cold flow results using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, first a grid sensitivity analysis is conducted and then a detailed comparison among the flow fields by two different numerical schemes, the standard Jameson–Schmidt–Turkel scheme and the AUSM scheme, is performed. The main differences are that the AUSM scheme is less numerically dissipative and it predicts a much stronger reverse flow in the recirculation zone.",34,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36569,"A numerical investigation has been conducted to explore the flowfield characteristics of a nonreactive cryogenic fluid through a swirl injector under supercritical conditions. The shear-stress transport turbulence model along with the Soave modification of Redlich–Kwong equation of state and a flow solver using the SIMPLEC algorithm for pressure–velocity coupling are used to evaluate various features of the turbulent swirling flow. Moreover, transport properties of the cryogenic fluid are determined by using the viscosity and thermal conductivity models derived by Chung et al. Experimental data of Cho et al. are used to validate the numerical results. The present numerical work shows the capability of predicting various characteristics of transcritical and supercritical swirling flows such as precessing vortex core and wavy shear-layer structures. Numerical simulations reveal that the spray-cone angle and instability wavelength slightly increase with the ambient pressure, whereas the pitch distance of the precessing vortex core decreases. Finally, to further investigate the dynamic features of the swirling jet, several spectral analyses are carried out. The longitudinal and azimuthal hydrodynamic instabilities, acoustic waves in the gaseous core, and Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities are clearly characterized using fast Fourier transformation.",34,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36550,"Hypersonic airbreathing engines rely on scramjet combustion processes, which involve high-speed, compressible, and highly turbulent reacting flows. The combustion environment and the turbulent flames at the heart of these engines are difficult to simulate and study in the laboratory under well-controlled conditions. Typically, wind-tunnel testing is performed that more closely approximates engine development rather than a careful investigation of the underlying physics that drives the combustion process. The experiments described in this paper, along with companion datasets, aim to isolate the chemical kinetic effects and turbulence–chemistry interaction from the fuel–air mixing process in a dual-mode scramjet combustion environment. A unique fuel-injection approach is adopted that produces a uniform fuel–air mixture at the entrance to the combustor and results in premixed combustion. This approach relies on the mixing enhancement of a precombustion shock train upstream of the dual-mode scramjet’s combustor. For the first time, a stable flame, anchored on a cavity flameholder, is reported for a scramjet combustor operating in premixed fuel–air mode. The new experimental capability has enabled numerous companion studies involving advanced diagnostics such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, particle image velocimetry, and planar laser-induced fluorescence.",34,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36637,"Generally, the shape of streamline-traced intakes is defined by stream surfaces based upon an inviscid template flowfield but corrected by appropriate local boundary-layer displacement thicknesses. However, this design methodology neglects secondary effects such as the occurrence of crossflow phenomena or local flow separation bubbles, which can lead to significant degradation of the overall intake performance. The present paper investigates the occurrence of crossflow phenomena within the boundary and entropy layers of a small-scale stream-traced intake of a scramjet vehicle. The crossflow is not anticipated during the design process and leads to a local accumulation of decelerated fluid near the combustor entrance. This effect lowers the margin against possible boundary-layer separation and intake unstart. It is found that the crossflow is mainly driven by inviscid phenomena principally linked to the presence of blunt leading edges.",34,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36640,"The effects of film cooling on the endwall region flow and aerodynamic losses are investigated experimentally as the film flow is delivered from the slots in the endwall upstream of a linear vane cascade. Four slots inclined at 30 deg deliver the film jet parallel to the main flow at four blowing ratios between 1.1 and 2.3 and at a temperature ratio of 1.0. The slots are employed in two configurations pitchwise: all four slots open (case 1) and two middle slots open (case 2). The inlet Reynolds number to the cascade is . Measurements of the blade surface pressure, axial vorticities, yaw angles, and total pressure loss distributions along the cascade are reported with and without (baseline) the film-cooling flow. The results show that the film flow changes the orientations, distributions, and strength of the endwall secondary flows and boundary layer. Case 1 of film cooling provides more mass flux and momentum than case 2 affecting the passage vortex legs. The overall total pressure losses at the cascade exit are always lower for the film-cooling cases than for the baseline. The overall losses are also lower at the low blowing ratios but higher at the high blowing ratios for the film-cooling case 1 than for case 2.",34,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36498,"This paper presents the experimental-visualization results of liquid breakup in a slinger injector with high-aspect-ratio radial–axial discharge channels over a range of rotational speeds between 600 and 10,000 rpm to identify detailed breakup pattern and spray characteristics. High-speed images of the jet breakup are captured and processed by a shadowgraph method. The particle/droplet imaging analysis technique is used to obtain the droplet-size distribution. Centripetal/Coriolis-induced stream-mode injection is observed for high-aspect-ratio axially canted discharge channels. The results show that the liquid-breakup process with rotational-speed values up to 4000 rpm corresponds to a subcritical stream-mode breakup. Moreover, a new phenomenon of jet bifurcation is observed at higher rotational speeds (more than 5000 rpm). Liquid-film disintegration is observed at rotational speeds of 10,000 rpm, which constitutes a transitional regime from subcritical to supercritical stream-mode breakup. The results show that the Sauter mean diameter decreases with increasing rotational speed. Furthermore, based on experimental observations, it is concluded that the number of injection orifices and their partitioning in different orientations affect the Sauter-mean-diameter values. Finally, a correlation is obtained between Sauter mean diameter, rotational speed, and volume-flow rate.",34,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36388,"The erosion of rocket-nozzle ablative thermal protection materials during the solid-rocket-motor burning time needs to be accounted for to get reliable performance predictions, especially for long-duration firings and/or small nozzles (that is, upper stages). This work numerically investigates the erosion behavior as a function of chamber conditions for the nozzles of the Vega launch vehicle solid rocket motors: Zefiro 9, Zefiro 23, and P80. This study has been performed using a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation solver with specific application to ablative nozzles. The throat region of the nozzle, and specifically the carbon/carbon nozzle insert, has received special attention because its evolution has a significant impact on the motor performance. The analysis of the throat insert has been performed for the three full-scale nozzles by comparing the predictions to measured data from static firing tests. A sensitivity analysis to the most important model parameters that can influence the throat erosion prediction has been performed to highlight modeling capabilities and limits, as well as numerical uncertainties. Finally, a characterization in terms of nozzle throat ablation mass flux dependency upon the motor chamber pressure has been derived for the three nozzles via a power fitting of the numerical data performed at discrete chamber pressure levels.",34,2

Tests were performed in supersonic wind tunnel SBR-50 at the University of Notre Dame at a Mach number of while varying the air pressure , an air temperature of , and a fuel mass flow rate of . The sensitivity of the ignition dynamics to the plasma power was also explored. The pressure distribution over the test section, schlieren visualization, and camera imaging were used for combustion intensity and combustion front identification. Optical emission spectroscopy and electrical measurements were employed to characterize the quasi-direct-current discharge. Previously, ignition and flameholding of hydrogen were demonstrated in a wide range of parameters. In the case of ethylene injection, it was shown under current test conditions that lower pressure and lower air temperature were beneficial for flameholding. A preliminary explanation of these unobvious effects is proffered.",34,2
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36317,"Rocket engine turbopump inducers can suffer from cavitation instabilities, dramatically limiting performance and life of the turbomachinery components. An unrestricted inducer geometry, representative of the Space Shuttle main engine low-pressure oxidizer pump inducer, is defined and serves as a platform for characterization of the cavitation dynamics. Experiments demonstrate rotating cavitation, alternate blade cavitation, and cavitation surge. Borrowing ideas from the modeling and assessment of rotating stall in aeroengine compressors, a previously established traveling wave energy analysis is applied. At flow coefficients higher than design, a single cell cavity occurs rotating at supersynchronous frequencies between 1.2 and 1.5 times rotor frequency. Optical measurements corroborate the findings and underlying mechanisms; the onset of rotating cavitation is governed by the interaction of the blade cavity with the leading edge of the adjacent blade. This leads to a change of incidence, which causes sheet cavity breakoff with periodic growth and collapse of cavities, yielding the apparent supersynchronous rotation of the cavities around the annulus. The paper breaks new ground in diagnostics of inducer dynamic behavior during rotating cavitation, alternate blade cavitation, and cavitation surge. The details of the unrestricted inducer geometry are provided for advancement of international research on rocket engine cavitation dynamics.",34,2
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36414,"Vortex generators within a two-dimensional external-compression supersonic inlet for Mach 1.6 were investigated to determine their ability to increase total-pressure recovery, reduce total-pressure distortion, and improve the boundary layer. The vortex generators studied included vanes and ramps. The geometric factors of the vortex generators studied included height, length, spacing, and positions upstream and downstream of the inlet terminal shock. The flow through the inlet was simulated through the computational solution of the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations on multiblock structured grids. The vortex generators were simulated by either gridding the geometry of the vortex generators or modeling the vortices generated by the vortex generators. The inlet performance was characterized by the inlet total-pressure recovery, total-pressure distortion, and incompressible shape factor of the boundary layer at the engine face. The results suggested that ramps were not effective, and only vanes positioned downstream of the terminal shock were effective in reducing distortion and improving the boundary layer. In the comparison study of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations to the experiment, microvanes were used to reduce boundary-layer separation completely. Of the geometric factors studied, the height of the vortex generator had the greatest effect.",34,2

Five different geometrical in-house design plasma generators are tested to obtain more effective discharge performance. The selected plasma igniter, with 4.0 mm discharge gap between two electrodes with a dielectric barrier, can be powered by an alternating-current supply with output voltage and sinusoidal wave frequency. The required discharging waveforms, and hence ignition energy, can be obtained by the automatic frequency-control system, via which the operating frequency can be adjusted up to 500.0 Hz holding with almost unchanged breakdown voltages and currents in practical application. The respective mixture of hydrogen, acetylene, and ethylene was allocated with an excess air coefficient ranged from 0.6 to 1.4. The initial pressure of the mixture changed from 0.04 to 0.1 MPa and was tested in the single-trial experiments. The shortened deflagration-to-detonation transition and detonation waves show the effectiveness of nonthermal plasma-assisted ignition for wider excess air coefficients. The multicycle mode is also conducted to show the performance of 15.0 Hz collaborative operation using the plasma igniter in an airbreathing pulse detonation engine. The feasibility of the present alternating-current-driven dielectric barrier discharge technology to generate nonthermal plasma is thus verified for single-trial detonation tube and multicycle pulse detonation engine ignition in laboratory.",34,2
