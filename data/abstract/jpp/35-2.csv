Larger normal and tangential displacements of the screen grid result in grid-to-grid gap change and aperture misalignment, which affects the perveance of the optics and modifies ion trajectories. To mitigate this problem, a solution that consists of more uniform thermal expansion of the optics is proposed. By rendering accelerator grid more elastic (i.e., reducing the elastic modulus) to make it easier to expand and increasing the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), grid-to-grid gap change and aperture center misalignment are not as pronounced as when both optics have the same properties. Selective laser melting with different fabrication parameters was used to produce molybdenum and titanium samples with different CTE and Young moduli, which were introduced in a thermoelastic model applied to a set of 50 cm domed ion optics. It has been showed that a 20% CTE increase and 25% elastic modulus reduction of the accelerator grid with respect to screen grid produced a 65% grid-to-grid gap change reduction and a 38% aperture misalignment reduction, compared with typical optics’ sets. However, the selective laser melting fabrication and testing of grids with feature control have not been accomplished yet.",35,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37064,"This paper covers the development of a new reduced order model for supersonic flow fields. The name of the method is the small disturbance streamline method. Its purpose is to model the unsteady flow dynamics of 2-D or 3-D inviscid, supersonic flow fields in response to small-amplitude perturbations in a quasi-1-D model. The primary motivation of this research is focused on reduced order modeling of supersonic inlets to be used as part of a larger propulsion system or aero-propulso-servo-elastic model. Previous reduced order models have focused mainly on the internal duct portion of the inlets while using simple methods for the unsteady dynamics of the external compression portion. While this method is applicable to internal ducts without normal shocks, the main contribution is in modeling the external supersonic compression portion. Four test cases of increasing complexity are provided and compared with a chosen state-of-the-art method. All results are verified with a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics code.",35,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37033,"The installed performance of a rotating detonation engine in a waverider vehicle was investigated. An ideal parametric analysis was performed by combining a waverider forebody generated by the osculating flowfield method and a second-order performance model for a rotating detonation engine. The analysis examined the waverider forebody geometry and freestream conditions on engine performance, with emphasis on volumetric efficiency and vehicle range. Design cases were selected by considering the physical limitations of initiating and sustaining a detonation wave. The greatest pressure recovery, and therefore the greatest installed engine performance, was observed at small waverider cone angles and convex forebody profiles. Engine performance was found to improve with increasing Mach number, but propellant autoignition temperature limits might present a barrier to operation at freestream Mach numbers above 3.5. These limits were eased, and performance increased, at higher dynamic pressures of operation. Mass-independent range metrics were observed to be insensitive to freestream parameters.",35,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37127,"A bench-scale experiment was developed to investigate the response of a liquid injector site to the passage of multiple-detonation-type events with application to rotating detonation engines. The experimental apparatus consisted of two detonation channels providing sequential steep-fronted pressure waves perpendicular to the site of a plain orifice water injector. Detonation events were developed using a branched predetonator with ethylene and oxygen as propellants. The experiment was mounted within a pressure vessel for operation at both 1 and 10 bar chamber pressures. The effect of various injector geometries, chamber pressures, and detonation elevations from the injector were studied. Backlit high-speed videos provided insight into the transient response and breakup of the jet, and data were correlated based on jet-to-crossflow momentum ratios. High-frequency pressure measurements at the injector face provided the basis for a simple analysis for predicting recovery behavior using known parameters.",35,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37175,"In dual-mode scramjet engines, the isolator comprises complex shock structures that provide the necessary compression of incoming air to sustain combustion farther downstream. This region of pressure increase is termed a pseudoshock. For stable scramjet design, it is essential to ensure sufficient length of isolator to fit the pseudoshock and achieve the target compression. Hence, models that can predict the pressure rise across and the length of the pseudoshock are valuable in this context. Although several empirical and reduced-order models are available in the literature, it is found that such models do not reliably predict the pseudoshock characteristics. To address this issue, a one-dimensional model is developed from a flux-conserved approach, which captures the pressure growth profiles for a wide range of Mach numbers. The model parameters are initially calibrated using a genetic algorithm but were found to exhibit variations based on experimental conditions. Using these results as prior information, a Bayesian approach is used to describe the one-dimensional model and related uncertainties statistically. This approach provided interesting insights, notably the ability to reduce the number of parameters. The resulting model accurately reproduces the pseudoshock characteristics over the range of operating conditions tested.",35,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37135,"This study is an investigation of axial-injection end-burning hybrid rockets aimed at revealing fuel regression characteristics under relatively high-pressure conditions. Firing tests are conducted using gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer at chamber pressures and oxidizer port velocities ranging from 0.22 to 1.05 MPa and 31 to , respectively. The results of 15 static firing tests show that the fuel regression rate increases as the chamber pressure increases, and regression rates range from approximately at 0.25 MPa to at 0.90 MPa. Furthermore, it is observed that the pressure exponent of the fuel regression rate is 1.05 and the fuel regression rate is not influenced by the oxidizer port velocity in this study. The model explains that the backfiring problem tends to occur in relatively high-pressure conditions, and it leads to the conclusion that increasing the nozzle throat diameter is an effective means of preventing backfiring from occurring.",35,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37189,"The aging behavior of composite propellant is a key parameter in determining the usable service life of an energetic system. The effect of aging on composite propellant burning rates is an understudied topic in the open literature. Recent research in the authors’ laboratory has led to the development of high-burning rate propellants containing titania nanoparticles and fluorescing propellants containing quantum dots. The current study assessed the aging behavior of composite ammonium perchlorate (AP)/hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene propellants, with specific emphasis on fluorescent properties and burning rates. Propellant formulations were based on either 80% monomodal or 85% bimodal AP distributions with and without titania nanoparticles and quantum dots. Propellant samples were thermally aged at temperatures of 63 and 85°C and humidity levels of 25 and 75% for up to 195 days to yield approximate service lives in the range of 0–25 years. Fluorescent imaging experiments were conducted with an ultraviolet light source to measure the uniformity of propellant samples. Ballistic testing was conducted in a constant-volume strand burner over the pressure range of 500–2250 psia (3.5–15.5 MPa). Spatial uniformity of the propellant fluorescence was not significantly altered with propellant age but did decrease in intensity to some degree. In general, the burning rate and pressure index of propellants decreased with increasing service life. Propellant formulations containing 85% bimodal AP were found to be more stable than formulations containing 80% monomodal AP. Inclusion of quantum dots or titania nanoparticles in the propellant formulation increased aging stability.",35,2

The burning agglomerate particle size, ablation, composition of combustion residue, and combustion efficiency have been studied under solid rocket motor conditions and compared with data obtained under high-pressure combustor conditions. The results indicate that, both in the high-pressure combustor and in the solid rocket chamber, the agglomerate-reduced propellant efficiently reduced the burning agglomerate particle size and the ablation of the insulation material, and it promoted a higher combustion efficiency of aluminum as compared to common propellants.",35,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36750,"In this study, global rainbow refractometry (GRR) is applied to investigate cryogenic spray droplets (i.e., liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen, and liquid methane). The refractive index and droplet size probability distribution are retrieved from the global rainbow pattern with inversion methods, using the complex angular momentum (CAM) scattering theory. Results show that temperature retrieved from the rainbow signal agrees well with temperature measured by the thermocouple, with discrepancy less than 7.5% for test sprays at temperatures ranging from 80 to 110 K. The temperature measurement uncertainty of GRR is estimated to lie within . The temperature recorded by the thermocouple is corrected by taking account of the heat transfer effect, which causes a temperature deviation of about . With Saengkaew’s methods, the deduced droplet size distribution shows bimodal or even multimodal characteristics in the measurement volume. The present work demonstrates the application of the GRR technique to the cryogenic sprays.",35,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37079,"Coaxial gaseous hydrogen/liquid-oxygen jet flames were studied experimentally as a function of the outer-to-inner momentum flux ratio using high-speed shadowgraphy and hydroxyl radical chemiluminescence imaging at 25 kHz. Particular attention was paid to wave dynamic mechanisms that could be observed. It was found that large structures generated at the exit of the annular flow created a chain of events that had a strong effect on the flame. These structures were found to impinge on the liquid-oxygen core and created local increases in emission (interpreted as combustion waves), local troughs in the liquid-oxygen core caused by increased vaporization, and waves composed of expansion gases: all of which convected downstream at different velocities, with the combustion wave propagating the fastest. The combustion waves were found to sometimes merge, sometimes spontaneously disappear, or sometimes continue to propagate as pairs. Earlier results had shown the importance of large-scale structure dynamics in the outer flow to simpler nonreacting coaxial flow. These results also confirmed their importance in combusting flows.",35,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36923,"The centrifugal compressor typically has a bent inlet pipe and volute due to the engine equipment installation, leading to the existence of asymmetric structures in both the inlet and outlet of the impeller. Under the coupling effect between the bent inlet pipe and outlet volute, the onset time and the circumferential position of the stall inception, as well as the stall development process, will be influenced. In this work, three centrifugal compressor models are investigated. The M0 model has the straight inlet pipe, and the M1 and M2 models have bent inlet pipes with different installation angles between the bent pipe and volute tongue. Unsteady numerical simulations are carried out, and the static pressure distributions of the casings are compared between the experiment and unsteady time-averaged results, to validate the unsteady simulations. Based on the casing static pressure comparison, unsteady simulations of the stall process are carried out for three models. Results show that the influence of the bent pipe on the stall process is smaller than that of the volute. Therefore, the circumferential onset position of stall inception is always located at the circumferential position of the pressure peak induced by the volute, irrespective of the pipe installation angle. The onset times of stall inception for the bent pipe models are earlier than those of the straight pipe models. When the low total and static pressure region of the bent pipe’s inner wall acts on the same position of the pressure peak region induced by the volute at the impeller inlet (corresponding to model M1), the momentum of incoming flow reduces at this position; thus, the capability of resistance to reverse pressure gradient decreases, which causes an earlier stall inception onset. In contrast, when the high total and static pressure region of the bent pipe outer wall acts on the same position of the pressure peak region induced by the volute at the impeller inlet (corresponding to model M2), the stall inception onset time will be delayed. Meanwhile, the stall development process of M2 is faster than that for M1. In the application of an inlet bent pipe, the installation angle of model M2 should be adopted to delay the stall inception onset and improve compressor performance.",35,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37132,"The linear acoustic behavior of an oxidizer-rich staged combustion engine preburner assembly that was similar to that of the RD-170 has been investigated by using real fluid speeds of sound to accommodate supercritical pressures. The speeds of sound, and hence the resulting frequencies, were approximately 20% higher than would be expected from ideal gas assumptions, which is a critical point of difference between the acoustic behavior of the preburner versus the main chamber. The results show that the mode shapes in the preburner–turbine inlet assembly are largely invariant with respect to the boundary condition used for the turbine blade row, but the frequencies are noticeably affected. The 2L mode is totally suppressed for both the acoustically open case and the case with the blade row impedance condition. The remaining longitudinal modes are damped. Both the frequency and the mode shape of the 1T mode remain totally invariant because the oscillations are confined to the injector regions and do not exhibit acoustic velocity with components normal to the impedance surface. The lack of damping of the 1T mode by the blade rows, combined with the relatively high magnitudes of acoustic velocity near the combustion zone, suggests that the 1T mode is a likely candidate to experience instability if it is suitably energized by the heat release.",35,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37133,"Increased background pressure in vacuum chamber test facilities as compared to on-orbit operation has been shown to influence the operation of electric propulsion devices such as Hall thrusters. This study aims to elucidate the impact of pressure on the ionization and acceleration mechanisms in a stationary plasma thruster, model SPT-100 Hall thruster, using time-averaged and time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence velocimetry. The results are compared for the thruster operating at an applied 300 V , with vacuum facility background pressures ranging from to . Time-averaged measurements reveal that, in general, an upstream shift in the position of the ionization and acceleration regions occurs as the facility pressure is increased above the nominal . Time-resolved measurements, implemented using a sample-hold scheme with resolution, emphasize that similar acceleration profiles are present within the Hall thruster discharge channel regardless of background pressure. Measurements taken at , where the facility background neutral density is similar to the neutral density emitted from the thruster, unexpectedly show increased ion acceleration over the next highest pressure condition at . These results indicate a not-yet well defined balance of the impacts of neutral ingestion, classical and turbulent electron transport on thruster operation, and that the ratio of the background to thruster neutral density is a more relevant benchmark than background pressure alone when evaluating Hall thruster operation.",35,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37317,"Bond-line stress and temperature sensors have been proposed in the past as a means to monitor the health of solid rocket motors. However, these previous works have only assessed the ability of these sensors to detect defects such as bond-line delaminations and bore cracks. In this work, the sensors were used to determine the effects of aging on the propellant modulus and the stress-free temperature. When composite propellants are cured, the molecular chains in the polymer entangle and cause shrinkage. This shrinkage causes stresses in the propellant at the cure temperature. Another cause of propellant stress is the differing coefficients of thermal expansion. Because the case and propellant have very different coefficients of thermal expansions, any cooling has an associated induced stress field in the propellant. Because the bond-line stress is linearly proportional to the temperature, the motor can be heated and cooled at 0.05°C/min while monitoring the bond-line stress. From these data, the stress-free temperature can be determined. These same data also produce estimates of the modulus. In this work, the analysis of the data showed a small decrease in the stress-free temperature and a moderate increase in the stiffness of the propellant, which correlates with the expected results.",35,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37304,"Sprays are prominent in various aerospace propulsion systems, but in-nozzle and near-field flow characteristics are not fully understood. Therefore, various nonintrusive probes have been applied to the measurement of spray characteristics. Such probes include well-known X-ray techniques and, to some extent, less well-known neutron methods, which are particularly useful for the study of flows inside nozzles. Unlike X-rays, for which the penetration depth of heavy metals is limited, neutrons are able to penetrate deeply into some metals, including aluminum, lead, and steel. Neutron imaging also complements X-ray imaging in light element detection, especially hydrogen, due to the large incoherent scattering cross section (80 b, in which ) with hydrogen. Thus, for dense near-field sprays, which combine metal nozzles and hydrogen-based liquids (e.g., hydrocarbon fuels), it is advantageous to use neutrons rather than X-rays for imaging measurements. In this work, proof-of-principle in situ neutron radiography measurements of metal spray nozzles and water sprays were conducted. The neutron results were compared with optical shadowgraph images of the sprays, which showed a good agreement. Additionally, imaging of the nozzle interior geometry and water inside the nozzle was demonstrated, and it was shown that neutron radiography can produce quantitative liquid concentration by two-dimensional snapshot and three-dimensional tomography scans.",35,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37185,"The laminar flame speeds of ethylene/air flames at various pressures (up to 10.0 atm) were measured using the expanding spherical flame. Three commonly used extrapolation models were employed, and the individual effects of pressure and flame radius range on the extrapolation uncertainty were investigated. It was found that the reduction in flame thickness reduces the extrapolation uncertainty at high pressures. At low pressures, large values of both lower and upper bounds of the extrapolation range in the flame radius range are preferred to reduce the extrapolation uncertainty. The measured laminar flame speeds were then compared with those from previous works and computations using USC and UCSD mechanisms. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted to illustrate the effects of pressure and equivalence ratio on flame chemistry and to reveal the controlling reactions for flame propagation. It was found that the laminar flame speed is more sensitive to flame chemistry at higher pressures, while the relative importance of individual chemical reactions is rarely affected by pressure. The C0 and C1 reactions were found to be the key for the laminar flame speed of ethylene/air flames under fuel-lean conditions, while the C2 reactions assume comparable importance with the C1 reactions on the fuel-rich side.",35,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37144,"One of the main issues that prevents the widespread use of hybrid propulsion is the low regression rate of classical hybrid fuels. Recently, paraffin-based fuels have been proposed as a viable solution; however, concerns about paraffin thermomechanical properties have often been seen as a possible showstopper. A small-scale hybrid rocket, able to burn hydrogen peroxide and paraffin wax for an extended time, has been designed, built, and tested in order to investigate the suitability of paraffin wax as a hybrid fuel for actual missions. The motor has a nominal burning time of 80 s, which is compatible with the majority of the missions performed by rocket motors. The motor has been tested successfully, demonstrating that paraffin can be used on real missions. Two different types of paraffin were used: type A and type B, which have regression rates of 1.45 and , respectively, at a reference oxidizer mass flux of and at a reference pressure of 15 bar. Moreover, temperature measurements inside the fuel grain demonstrated the liquid layer theory to be valid. An instrumented nozzle has also been used to better investigate the thermal behavior of the nozzle assembly.",35,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37201,"Recent studies identified the addition of metal particles into conventional liquid fuels (jet fuel, gasoline, diesel) as one possible strategy to increase fuel energy density and specific impulse. The objective of this work is to evaluate the combustion potential of hybrid fuels by developing detailed chemical mechanisms to model their behavior. Thus, this work is focused on 1) identifying the key parameters that control the promoting/inhibiting effects of aluminum on jet fuel combustion and 2) the assessment of the impact of 1% (weight) of passivated aluminum on the main combustion parameters (combustion temperatures, ignition delays, laminar flame speeds). This study considers the combined effects of aluminum and alumina on combustion properties based on the ratio of their mole fractions. The analyses of the mechanism revealed 1) the origin of the promoting/inhibiting effects on combustion and 2) that the hybrid fuel combustion exhibits a three-stage reactivity, whereas the conventional jet fuel presents only one. This work proposes a first detailed kinetic mechanism for hybrid fuels combustion. Moreover, the numerical results obtained in this wide parametric study evidence that hybrid fuels must be used in fuel-rich regimes at low temperatures to maximize their combustion performance.",35,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37227,"High-fidelity Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation modeling is applied to examine the influence of the symmetry plane on the supersonic flow and combustion characteristics in a round-to-elliptic–transition scramjet combustor. A quarterly split domain and the full domain are modeled by using up to 0.14 billion cells and a third-order scale-selective discretization scheme. The combustion chemistry is described by the finite-rate partially stirred reactor model based on multicomponent diffusion and a skeletal kerosene mechanism with 19 species/53 reactions. Time-averaged pressure, temperature, Mach number, and heat release rate are compared to examine the influence of the symmetry assumption on the mean flow fields. The exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy across the symmetry planes are analyzed. Considerable increases in the combustion efficiency and total pressure loss occur when applying the full domain, although with the similar mixing efficiency. Turbulence spectrum analysis confirms the power-law for supersonic flows, and the inertial subrange is found to be shorter in the quarter-domain modeling. A comparison of the Borghi’s diagrams shows that the data points shift from the flamelet mode to the thin reaction zone mode when using the full domain, and at least of them cannot be described by fast-chemistry combustion models.",35,2
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37297,"This paper reports on the reactivity and hypergolicity of different solid fuels with both nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON) oxidizers using drop tests. The main objectives of the study were to identify hypergolic additives for use with a paraffin-based hybrid fuel, and to quantify the influence of pressure on the reactivity of these different potential additives. As expected, it was found that ignition delays decrease as pressure increases. With 75 wt.% NTO and 25 wt.% nitric oxide (MON-25) and borane-trimethylamine, a decrease in minimum ignition delays of 95% was observed when pressure was increased by 50 psi, whereas pararosaniline base went from nonhypergolic to hypergolic over the same pressure range. Also, all the compounds tested showed longer ignition delays with increasing concentration of nitric oxide. Finally, common features observed in silyl amides, amides, and organic compounds were investigated. Further work will be needed to verify whether these preliminary trends can be generally applied to the selection of additional solid hypergolic propellants.",35,2

The influence of including the geometric representation of the probe instrumentation is investigated by considering the rake fairing geometry and also the geometry of the complete rake with the probes. Some aspects of the probe modeling are also discussed. A direct comparison of the numerical simulation results with the experimental values is performed for the wall static pressure along the duct, total pressure recovery, and distortion indices at the aerodynamic interface plane. Three different eddy-viscosity turbulence models are evaluated: the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras, and the two-equation realizable and shear stress transport. A virtual 200-probe rake is also proposed, beyond the standard 40-probe rake, to enrich the total pressure and distortion indices comparisons. An overall good agreement is observed among experimental results and the numerical wall static pressure and the total pressure topology at the aerodynamic interface plane. Some discrepancies for the distortion indices are verified and discussed in detail.",35,2
