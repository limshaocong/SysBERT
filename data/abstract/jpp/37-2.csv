0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37736,"This paper discusses the aerodynamic analysis and design of a novel, hubless, contra-rotating, rim-driven fan (RDF) device. Rim-driven thruster technology has been used for marine propulsion for decades, yet RDF technology has not been comparably developed for aerospace applications. This paper demonstrates that an innovative two-stage contra-rotating RDF configuration provides the potential for a significant increase in the available thrust and efflux velocity when compared with existing technologies. The analysis was conducted for an RDF device with a relatively small fan diameter of 120 mm. However, the findings of this study can be equally applied to the performance of much larger and more powerful RDF propulsion units. This would also include devices having multiple contra-rotating paired stages, for example, four, six, or more rotors to permit higher-pressure ratios and exhaust airspeeds suitable for large modern aircraft propulsion.",37,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37743,"Because of their potential reductions of fuel consumption, disruptive propulsion concepts such as boundary layer ingestion have lately earned the attention of the aerospace community. Because of the increased level of interactions brought by the tight airframe–propulsor integration, an accurate assessment of this benefit requires a detailed study of the engine behavior from both an aerodynamics and an overall performance standpoint. In this context, this Paper presents a fully coupled methodology that integrates a zero-dimensional thermodynamic cycle analysis of the core and a three-dimensional body force representation of the fan stage into a single numerical computation. This approach allows the efficient simulation of fan–distortion interactions and engine overall performance in terms of accuracy vs computational cost tradeoff, making it well suited for conducting full aircraft–engine computational fluid dynamics calculations. The coupling is demonstrated in the assessment of boundary layer ingestion impacts on the small DGEN380 turbofan. Results provide a quantification of such impacts on fan efficiency, engine power demand, thrust specific fuel consumption, flow distortion transfer, and fan stage aeromechanical response, for different engine net thrust settings.",37,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37976,"Hypergolic hybrid motors are advantageous for rocket propulsion due to their simplicity, reliability, low weight, and safety. Many hypergolic hybrid fuels with promising theoretical performance are not practical due to their sensitivity to temperature or moisture. Ammonia borane (AB) has been proposed and studied as a potential hypergolic hybrid fuel that provides both excellent performance and storability. This study investigates the effect of droplet impact velocity, pellet composition, and storage humidity on ignition delay of AB with white fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer. Most ignition delays measured were under 50 ms with many under 10 ms and some even under 2 ms, which is extremely short for hybrid systems. Higher droplet velocities led to slightly shorter ignition delays, and exposing samples to humidity slightly increased ignition delay. An AB pellet composition of at least 20% epoxy binder was found to minimize ignition delay. The epoxy facilitates ignition by absorbing or adhering the oxidizer and slowing the reaction with the fuel, preventing oxidizer expulsion and holding it close to the fuel. These results emphasize the importance of binder properties in hypergolic hybrids. Pellets varying in composition and storage method were extinguished and reignited with the oxidizer to demonstrate reignition capability.",37,2

Past simulation results from many research groups on the same bluff-body flame test case demonstrate significant variation that is neither fully understood nor quantified. To identify potential sources of this variation, three categories of sensitivities are assessed for a stable combustion bluff-body flame test case: exit boundary conditions, turbulent combustion closure models, and grid resolution. Comparisons with experimental data are presented, and an analysis of the causes of the discrepancies is informed by the sensitivity analysis. Specifically, low grid sensitivities at the finest resolution indicate that notable discrepancies with the experiment are likely due to model or boundary condition errors. All three categories of sensitivities are identified as significant, and the dominant source of variation in the results depends on the resolution and flow variable of interest. In spite of a lack of thermoacoustic oscillations, exit boundary condition effects are shown to be substantial, and errors in velocity statistics are minimized by extending the computational domain into the exhaust region.",37,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37814,"This Paper explores keeper ignition and discharge characteristic of a hollow cathode center mounted on a Hall thruster to discuss the optimum startup sequence. A strong magnetic field along the hollow cathode in the center-mount configuration is considered to play an important role in the ignition and discharge; however, the characteristics in this configuration has never been reported. The effect of cathode mass flow rate on the ignition and discharge with 3 A keeper ignition is examined both with and without magnetic field. The influence of cathode heater power and flow from the anode is also investigated. The lower flow rate causes strong ionization instability, while the higher flow rate seems to induce ion acoustic turbulence. Applied magnetic field improves the ionization instability due to the decrease in electron temperature through plasma production. These results indicate ignition sequences over flow rate with magnetic field appear promising. On the other hand, the confined electrons around the magnetic field line prevent the initiation of the discharge. The ignition and instability are improved with high heat-up power because more thermionic emission is obtained. The anode flow provides slight improvement to the characteristics. The Fourier transform also demonstrates the presence of ionization instability and ion acoustic turbulence. The behavior of peak frequencies of ionization instability can be explained based on the predator–prey theory.",37,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38002,"Merging of corotating vortices is of primary interest in the field of supersonic mixing due to the ability of two or more structures to coalesce and form a larger one which enhances the stirring motion and straining in the flow, thus promoting turbulence production and mixing augmentation. During experimental efforts aimed at quantifying mean and fluctuating flowfields produced by the merging of two supersonic streamwise corotating vortices through stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, it was noticed that both the strain rates and turbulent kinetic energy would peak within the elongated merger’s vorticity patch. The article discusses how this is in fact a counterintuitive phenomenon and shows that a possible explanation can be given by studying the flow within a frame of reference which rotates with the merger itself. It will be shown how the merger is surrounded by a different flowfield than that measured in the laboratory frame of reference, characterized by the presence of recirculation zones referred to as ghost vortices. These vortices introduce large rates of strain within the merger, thus providing a possible justification for the high levels of turbulence attained within the rotating structure. The experimental findings are strongly corroborated by reduced-order, inviscid simulations, showing the formation of similar structures and clarifying the presence of peaks of strain rates within the merger.",37,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38049,"An experimental study was performed on an ethylene/oxygen/air pulse detonation engine to examine the effect of frequency and spark delay time on the thrust output and efficiency. Reactants were mixed in a stainless-steel combustion chamber at frequencies ranging from 1 to 40 Hz. Dynamic pressure measurements were recorded throughout the system over the testing interval to determine exhaust velocities. Efficiency was evaluated based on the experimental average frequency and the experimental average velocity. Results on experimental thrust, detonation frequency, and Chapman–Jouguet velocities were analyzed. It was observed that average thrust increased exponentially with the increase of detonation frequency. For a spark delay time of 2 ms, maximum efficiency and thrust were achieved for given frequencies. As spark delay time increased beyond 6 ms, testing became erratic, with pulses misfiring, and a decrease in efficiency and thrust was observed until no combustion occurred beyond a spark delay time of 8 ms.",37,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37849,"There has been a recent need for rapid response power generation device on aircraft. Current power generators consume a large portion of the aircraft’s usable volume, and they are also extremely heavy relative to their power output; therefore, the need for compact, power-dense auxiliary power units or bleed air turbine (BAT) arose. A solution comes in the form of coupling rotating detonation engines (RDEs) with a turbine generator. Previous work on RDE turbine integration has been successfully demonstrated with significant power extraction, but a modification leading to a more compact form with higher power density would be beneficial. Therefore, a new type of RDE referred to as the radial rotating detonation engine (RRDE) was developed for use as a combustor for a BAT. This design was based on a disk-shaped device within which reactants flow from the outer radius, detonate, and then exit the inner radius. Here the flow was routed into a compact centrifugal turbocharger turbine to extract the power. The power extracted from the turbine was measured using the compressor side of the turbocharger as a brake. Three different nozzle guide vanes changed the flow angle into the turbine. Various mechanisms of backpressuring the device were also accomplished over a range of mass flows. The results show significant power output from the device of over 60 kW at an operational speed over 110 kRPM. The RRDE configuration suffers from losses in the system, but has the potential for overall thermal efficiencies of up to 40%. The results also suggested that the interactions between the combustion chamber and the nozzle guide vanes may be a large source of losses. Finally, the addition of compressor backpressure and turbine backpressure plates did not affect the operating mode of the RRDE, but did improve the output power of the system.",37,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38084,"Gaseous hydrogen/liquid oxygen turbulent shear coaxial flames were subjected experimentally to both pressure antinode (PAN) and pressure node (PN) transverse acoustic forcing as a function of the gas-to-liquid momentum flux ratio. The response of the flow was recorded using simultaneous high-speed imaging of backlit shadowgraphs and chemiluminescence emission. It was observed that a wave amplification mechanism, defined in Sec. III, previously observed for unforced flows, remained present in the forced flows but was modified by the forcing. The response tended to be axisymmetric for PAN forcing, where the pressure fluctuations are symmetric, and asymmetric for PN forcing, where the velocity fluctuations are asymmetric. Additional analyses performed included dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and an analysis of the wave trajectories as a function of time. Beyond the main observation that the wave amplification mechanism remained operative not only for unforced flows but also for both kinds of transverse forcing, secondary observations included a greater relative effect on the flow for PN forcing than for PAN forcing and a reduced general response of the flow to the acoustics at higher momentum flux ratios. The velocity of waves observed in the emission were found to depend mainly on the shear layer velocity and not directly on the acoustics.",37,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38209,"This paper investigates the influence of liquid jet fuel properties on flame lean blowout (LBO) using an annular coflow spray burner. This behavior has been studied before; however, inconsistent conclusions have been reached regarding the dependency of LBO performance on the properties that influence fuel atomization and mixture formation. LBO limits are measured at three different fuel flow rates to evaluate the influence of the atomization quality/regimes on LBO. It was found that the laboratory spray burner provides similar trends in LBO as a realistic gas turbine combustor but with less time and fuel consumption. Furthermore, the approach used in this work differs from traditional LBO measurements in that the fuel flow rate is kept constant while altering the air flow rate to allow for greater control of the atomization process, which is strongly affected by the fuel flow rate. The results suggest that, to an extent, higher amounts of liquid fuel entering the flame can enhance flame stability. They also suggest that testing at different fuel flow conditions and/or with variable injection hardware, coupled with testing of jet fuels exhibiting variations in key physical properties important in their atomization, is most likely the cause of discrepancy observed in previous works.",37,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38009,"The response behavior of capillary tube attenuated pressure sensor arrangements is studied using a rotating detonation engine as a nonlinear pressure wave source. The resulting measured pressures are examined as a function of the magnitude of the nonlinear pressure fluctuations, the mean pressure, and the forcing frequency applied to the pressure input port of the sensor. In addition, length and inner diameter of the sensor tubes are studied as a way to tie the current work into the established body of literature. Analytic models are used to provide understanding and predict the expected behaviors of the various tested sensor configurations, in an effort to supply reliable and accurate measurements of high-fidelity static pressures with specific application to ongoing rotating detonation engine research.",37,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38087,"An experimental study of a rotating detonation engine (RDE) operating with natural gas and air at elevated chamber pressures and air preheat temperatures was conducted to quantify its performance at conditions representative of land-based power generation gas turbine engines. The thrust produced by the combustor was measured to characterize its work output potential. High-frequency pressure transducers and broadband chemiluminescence measurements of the flame provided information about the wave structure and dynamics. Analysis of common performance metrics demonstrated the necessity of normalizing any RDE performance parameter by the driving system potential, typically the reactant manifold pressure. Application of a thermodynamic performance model to a generic RDE identified the area ratio between the RDE exhaust and injection throats as the primary parameter affecting delivered pressure gain. The model was further applied to draw comparison with experimental measurements of net pressure gain for identical flow conditions. Only one of the two tested injector configurations followed the predicted trends, suggesting that performance of the second was governed by physical processes other than the reactant thermodynamics. Although an absolute pressure gain was not demonstrated, it is promising that the natural gas–air RDE delivered up to 90% of the theoretical performance.",37,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38033,"In this study, the effects of fuel port geometry and fuel additives on the performance characteristics of additively manufactured solid fuels in a hybrid rocket are explored. Static rocket motor firings were used to examine the performance characteristics, such as fuel regression rate and efficiency. Using a baseline fuel of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), a traditional center-perforated fuel grain as well as elliptical and swirl-elliptical port geometries were considered. The effect of aluminum as a solid fuel additive to the center-perforated fuel grain and the swirl-ellipse geometry was also investigated. Custom 3-D printer filament was developed, enabling the manufacture of fuels containing 10 and 25 wt % nano-aluminum as well as 25 wt % micron-sized aluminum allowing for a direct comparison of aluminum particle concentration and size. The swirl-ellipse geometry alone improved regression rates by about 35%, while exhibiting similar efficiency as the center-perforated fuel grain. The combination of the addition of nano-aluminum and the swirl-ellipse geometry resulted in an overall regression rate increase of about compared to the baseline PMMA center-perforated grain geometry.",37,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38044,"This Paper discusses the results of an experimental study to investigate the performance of a converging nozzle with fluidic thrust vectoring, using secondary-jet injection, through the measurements of various parameters such as thrust, flow rates, and pressures over a range of operating conditions. The thrust coefficient is found to be dependent on the nozzle pressure ratio (NPR) of the primary nozzle and momentum ratio or mass ratio of the primary and secondary mass flows. The vector angle is found to depend only on momentum ratio or mass ratio and independent of the NPR. The secondary-jet injection is observed to increase the magnitude of net thrust by reducing the effective flow area while reducing the thrust coefficient. It is established that four additional parameters, namely, the fluidic thrust vectoring coefficient, nondimensional mass flow rate of the core jet, nondimensional mass flow rate of secondary jet, and mass ratio, are required to describe the vectoring performance comprehensively. The mass ratio appears to be a suitable parameter for developing the control algorithms as the other dependent parameters are linear functions of the mass ratio. Using an example, a procedure to identify the operational zone over the nozzle characteristic map is demonstrated.",37,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37915,"In this study, to reduce oxidizer to fuel ratio (O/F) shifts, which are a serious problem for a hybrid rocket used for launching a satellite, an altering-intensity swirling-flow-type hybrid rocket was developed. It can alter the swirl intensity instantaneously during operation by controlling the ratio of the swirling oxidizer flow rate to the axial oxidizer flow rate using ball valves. Eight firing tests were conducted to obtain the relation among oxidizer mass flux, swirl intensity, and regression rate. Then the time scheduling of the valve open ratio was determined to eliminate O/F shift. Finally, a firing test was conducted using this system. From the results, the O/F shift was reduced from 2 to 1, i.e., halved.",37,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37848,"Aluminum (Al)/lithium (Li)-alloy-based fuels can potentially improve composite propellant performance and reduce hydrochloric acid formation. Shattering microexplosions have been observed in Al–Li-based composite propellants at 0.1 MPa; however, combustion characterization of Al–Li-based propellant as a function of pressure has not been performed previously. Measurement of the burning rate of an Al–Li composite propellant and quantification of agglomerate production near the propellant surface at various pressures are presented in this work. Al–Li particle agglomeration, determined to be unconsumed Al–Li, increased with increasing pressure, suggesting that microexplosions were inhibited at higher pressures. Burning rate experiments demonstrated a plateau burning rate effect that occurred in propellant with fine grade (mean diameter: ) Al–Li particles, whereas the as-received Al–Li-containing (mean diameter: ) propellant maintained a constant pressure exponent of about 0.39 over all pressures tested. The finer Al–Li propellant had a pressure exponent of 0.59 at pressures below about 4 MPa and a pressure exponent of 0.11 above 4 MPa. Surface imaging of the Al–Li propellant showed a distinctive condensed phase reaction on the surface, which became more prominent with the finer Al–Li particles and at higher pressures: a potential source of the plateau burning rate effect.",37,2
