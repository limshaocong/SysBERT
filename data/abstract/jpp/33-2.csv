0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36114,"The study is concerned with the simulation of cracks in finitely deforming viscoelastic media. The main goal is to establish a computational methodology for crack propagation analyses in bulk material and interface debonding using an extended finite element method and cohesive zone modeling. First, a linear elastic plate with a single-edge crack and a linear viscoelastic plate with a double-edge crack are selected as benchmark problems. Upon verification of the extended finite element method and cohesive zone modeling results against those from the conventional crack propagation method and those from the literature, a nonlinear viscoelastic solid rocket motor subjected to various thermal loadings is analyzed for failure due to bore cracking or interface debonding. For a cooldown the stress distribution along the bond line is determined for the bore cracking mode and results are compared with those from the literature. For the cyclic temperature, the propagation of bore cracks is analyzed using an extended finite element method, and the propagation of initial debonding is studied using cohesive zone modeling. For both failure modes, crack propagation occurs only during the first cooldown. The relation between the crack growth and the initial crack size show parabolic behavior. Overall, it is concluded that the extended finite element method and cohesive zone modeling are suitable methods for crack propagation analysis in nonlinear viscoelastic media.",33,2

The study is carried out by introducing a preinducer upstream of the main inducer of a centrifugal pump. The test methodology consists of non-cavitation and cavitation tests at design and off-design conditions. The tests are carried out with and without the preinducer to obtain a comparison of the effect of the preinducer. The study provides the design parameters of the preinducer, the details of the test rig, the test article configuration, and details of the test conducted to find out the performance of the preinducer. It also gives the effect of the preinducer on the noncavitating behavior, cavitation inception, and net positive suction head corresponding to the 3% head drop for the centrifugal pump.",33,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36262,"The mixing and combustion characteristics of liquid-oxygen/kerosene bi-swirl injectors are investigated under the supercritical conditions typical of contemporary rocket engines. The basis of the study is a large-eddy simulation technique combined with a unified treatment of real-fluid thermodynamics. The turbulence/chemistry interaction is treated using a laminar flamelet library approach. Emphasis is placed on the near-field flow and flame development downstream of the inner swirler. The flame is found to be stabilized by two counter-rotating vortices in the wake region of the liquid-oxygen post, which is covered by the kerosene-rich mixture. The width of the kerosene annulus is found to significantly affect the injector behavior. A wider annulus induces a larger spreading angle of the liquid-oxygen stream, which intercepts the kerosene stream in a more efficient way. Increasing the annulus width, however, imposes a wake region in a broader zone. The resultant flame becomes relatively unstable if the flame thickness is larger than the liquid-oxygen post thickness. Variation of the kerosene annulus width has a negligible effect on the dominant frequency of the pressure fluctuation, but it changes the amplitude of fluctuation.",33,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35996,"The effects of tab number and tab orientation angle on the pumping performance for an incompressible short air-to-air mixer–ejector equipped with tabbed primary nozzle were experimentally explored. The incorporated mixing duct was designed in a straight type with a typical area ratio (mixing duct to primary nozzle) of 3.06 and length-to-diameter ratio of 0.8. Simultaneously, a numerical computation was also carried out on the simulation of mixing flowfields to reveal the trends and differences observed in the tabbed mixer–ejector measurements. The results confirm that the streamwise vortices created by the tabs cause an improvement in mixing efficiency, leading to greater values of pumping for a short air-to-air mixer–ejector. By comparing with the baseline case of confluent nozzle, the eight-tab nozzle increases the pumping ratio by approximately 75%. This value is about 50, 30, and 15% for the six-tab, four-tab, and 12-tab nozzles, respectively. It is also found that the tabbed primary nozzle with tab orientation angle of 135 deg is capable of entraining the maximum amount of ambient air into the mixing duct. In the range between 90 and 135 deg, tab orientation angle seems have a weak influence on the ejector pumping performance. However, an obvious reduction in ejector pumping ratio occurs under the large tab orientation angle of 150 deg. For an incompressible short air-to-air mixer–ejector, it is concluded that more intense streamwise vortices would produce stronger mixing and thus lead to a larger pumping ratio.",33,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36134,"Boron-based fuel-rich propellants with different formulation were prepared, and the condensed-phase products under different chamber pressures were collected in this study. The composition of boride (elemental boron, boron oxide, boron carbide, and boron nitride) in the condensed-phase products was measured by chemical analysis and the particle size distribution was determined using a laser particle size analyzer. Moreover, the burning rate and combustion temperature of the propellants were measured using a strand burner. The experimental results show that both the propellant burning rate and combustion temperature played an important role in the production of boride. There might be large amounts of boron carbide in the condensed-phase products which appear to have a negative effect on the combustion efficiency of the propellants studied in this work. The production of boron carbide could be reduced and combustion efficiency was improved by lowering the combustion temperature while increasing the burning rate. This study also shows that reducing the chamber pressure also causes a decrease in production of boron carbide.",33,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36205,"All four giant planets, far from the Earth and sun and having deep gravitational wells, present propulsion and power mission issues, but they also have an ambient plasma and magnetic field that allows for a common mission concept. Electrodynamic tethers can provide propellantless drag for planetary capture and operation down the gravitational well, and they can generate power to use along with or be stored for inverting tether current. The design for an alternative to NASA’s proposed Europa mission is presented here. The operation requires the spacecraft to pass repeatedly near Jupiter, for greater plasma density and magnetic field, raising a radiation-dose issue that past analyses did take into account; tape tethers tens of kilometers long and tens of micrometers thick, for greater operation efficiency, are considered. This might result, however, in attracted electrons reaching the tape with a penetration range that exceeds tape thickness, thereby escaping collection. The mission design requires keeping the range below thickness throughout, resulting in an orbit perijove only hundreds of kilometers above Jupiter and tapes a few kilometers long. A somewhat similar mission design might apply to other giant outer planets.",33,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36342,"In this work, the evaporation and combustion processes of liquid propellant ammonium dinitramide–methanol aqueous solution were investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer and a Curie-point pyrolysis unit, respectively, and the gas-phase products were measured by a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that methanol and water evaporated first, followed by the decomposition of ammonium dinitramide at heating rates of 5–. When a catalyst was added, ammonium dinitramide decomposed much faster and released heat that let methanol evaporate immediately as the propellant solution was in contact with the catalyst particles. To explore how the decomposition of ammonium dinitramide is coupled with the oxidation of methanol, the propellant solution was heated by a Curie-point pyrolysis unit at a rate of to temperatures ranging from 160 to 670°C. Large amounts of nitrous oxide and ammonia were detected at all temperatures, suggesting that most of the decomposition of ammonium dinitramide occurred at the condensed phase. Finally, a detailed gas-phase ammonium dinitramide–methanol reaction model was built to analyze the coupling between the decomposition of ammonium dinitramide and the oxidation of methanol.",33,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36217,"Reaction mechanisms for jet-fuel combustion were built with the aim of providing a better description of the chemistry to reacting flow simulations used to design future aircraft engines. This research effort focused on combustion of Fischer–Tropsch synthetic jet fuel (S-8) in vitiated air at conditions relevant to jet engines, augmentors, and interturbine burners (, , and in air). The complex S-8 fuel mixture was approximated with a two-component surrogate mixture of -decane and iso-octane. A wholly new, elementary-step reaction mechanism for the surrogate consisting of 291 species and 6900 reactions was constructed using automatic mechanism generation software. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine reaction rate-constant sensitivity, model prediction uncertainty, and consistency of the model with published ignition delay time data. As a test application, the S-8 reaction model was used to estimate augmentor static stability using a simple Damköhler number analysis that showed increased stability with temperature from 800 to 1400 K and NO concentration from 0 to 1000 ppm (v/v). The ability to quickly generate accurate mechanisms for simple surrogates allows for new synthetic fuels to be quickly modeled and their behavior predicted for an array of experimental conditions and practical applications.",33,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36179,"In this paper, applied-field magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters were operated with a discharge current lower than 20 A and an argon propellant flow rate under by using a thermionic electron emission-type hollow cathode. Both axisymmetric and rectangular channel configurations were examined. The characteristic value of the ratio of the applied-field electromagnetic thrust to the self-field electromagnetic thrust, which was a maximum of approximately 50 in previous research, increased to more than 800 in this study, whereas the specific power was in approximately the same range as in previous studies. The trends of thrust and discharge voltage were explained by referring to the “swirl acceleration” model. Such operation could be useful for near-future high-power electric propulsion applications.",33,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36105,"The ion beam shepherd is an innovative contactless technique for space debris removal in which an impulse transfer thruster pushes the debris object through the action of a plasma plume and an impulse compensation thruster maintains formation flying. The optimal operational point of both thrusters strongly depends on their characteristics and on the physics of the plasma plume expansion into vacuum. With the use of dedicated thruster performance models, complemented with simplified plume expansion and plasma–debris interaction models, a system-level optimization study of the impulse transfer thruster alone and of the overall electric propulsion subsystem is presented for an ion beam shepherd mission example. An optimum design point is found for minimum overall power consumption in both cases.",33,2

The experiments were performed at the freestream velocity in the range of and the freestream static temperature in the range of . The icing environment conditions include the mean volume diameter of and the liquid water content of 1.0 and . A full-scale inlet strut was used in experiments of the hot-air anti-icing performance and heat transfer. The temperature distributions on the inlet strut surface were measured by thermocouples. The characteristics of the heat and mass transfer at different freestream static temperatures and velocities, liquid water contents, and anti-icing hot-air mass flow rates were analyzed. Ice shapes on the strut leading edge were compared under different icing conditions.",33,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36277,"This study describes a numerical simulation of a miniature vortex combustion cold-wall chamber using a two-stage choked nozzle approach. Recognizing that the nozzle is choked at the throat under normal operation, the miniaturized vortex chamber is decomposed into two parts: The first segment extends from the headwall to the throat, whereas the second extends from the throat to the nozzle exit plane. In stage 1, an incompressible model is used leading up to the nozzle entrance. In stage 2, compressibility is superimposed, starting with the output from stage 1. This two-stage simulation reduces CPU time and helps to achieve convergence. Compressible simulations are then performed using a three-dimensional pressure-based, finite volume, unstructured solver. Furthermore, reaction mechanisms are simulated using a non-premixed combustion model with adiabatic probability density function lookup tables. Eight conventional chemical species are used, including , , , , , O, H, and OH. At the outset, the existence of a bidirectional motion is demonstrated and the spatial invariance of the so-called mantle interface, which separates inner and outer vortex regions, is corroborated. This work confirms the effectiveness of convective film cooling of the chamber walls as a characteristic feature of cyclonic motion involving a low-temperature oxidizer.",33,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36208,"An engineering model for effects of helical fuel ports on hybrid fuel regression rates is developed and compared with test results for five different helical fuel grain geometries. The tested grains were additively printed from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and burned in gaseous oxygen at 200 psia chamber pressure. Regression rate amplification above the nominal cylindrical port regression rate is calculated as the product of two multipliers: 1) one due to a helix-induced skin friction increase, and 2) another due to helical flow suppression of radial wall blowing. The first multiplier is based on an existing skin friction correlation, modified to account for diminishing helical centerline radius of curvature as the fuel burns and the port becomes increasingly cylindrical. The radial blowing suppression multiplier is derived as the ratio of centrifugal force due to helical flow to radial momentum out flow of ablated material from the fuel wall. Calculations show that approximately 75% of the regression rate amplification results from skin friction increase due to helical rotation. The remaining amplification results from centrifugal flow suppression of radial wall blowing. Statistical analysis of the model/data residuals demonstrates better than 4% mean fit error over mass flux levels ranging from 2.0 to .",33,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36211,"The paper develops a coupled multiphysics finite element method to analyze satellite deorbit by a bare flexible electrodynamic tether. Unlike the existing approaches, the current method assumes that the tether is flexible and deflectable, and its efficiency of electron collection varies along the tether length depending on tether deflection. The orbital motion limited theory, which dictates the electron collection by a bare tether, is discretized and solved with the same finite element mesh as the tether dynamics to couple the electron collection with the tether flexural deflection. The advantages of the new method are demonstrated by numerical simulations. Compared with a reference method based on straight tether assumption, the coupling effect between the electron collection and tether deflection is significant, leading to the dynamic variation of electrodynamic force acting on the tether. Although the deorbit rates predicted by these two methods are almost the same, the new method predicts a shorter stable deorbit period than the reference method. It demonstrates that the new method is more accurate, and it should be used for detailed engineering design.",33,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36199,"A helicon plasma thruster has been studied to develop a completely electrodeless electric thruster using high-density helicon plasmas. The proposed helicon plasma thruster involves two processes: the generation of source dense plasma by using a helicon wave, and the additional acceleration of the generated plasma by using the Lorentz force generated by the product of the induced azimuthal current and external radial magnetic field. This additional acceleration method requires additional electrodes or coils, leading to a longer discharge tube. Therefore, it is necessary to find a good configuration that minimizes wall losses within the discharge tube. Here, thrust characteristics such as thrust, thrust-to-power ratio, specific impulse, and thrust efficiencies of argon and xenon gases were studied, using a radio frequency of 7 MHz and an input power less than 3 kW, to optimize the target plasma without employing an additional acceleration method. A helicon plasma source, with electromagnets and permanent magnets, was used to generate a flexible divergent magnetic field, and a target-type cylindrical thrust stand was installed in a large buffer chamber (volume: , pumping speeds: 1000 and ). In the case of argon gas, the maximum thrust and the thrust-to-power ratio were 21 mN and , respectively, whereas in the case of xenon gas, these values were 40 mN and , respectively.",33,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36202,"The application of a recent concept, a thermionic bare tether (that is, a long conductor coated with a thermionic material), to a practical engineering problem (deorbit space debris from geostationary transfer orbit) is presented. Lorentz drag on a thermionic bare tether, during each pass through an arc close to the perigee, lowers the apogee progressively and produces the object reentry. The performance of a spacecraft equipped with a thermionic bare tether is studied at two different levels, using models that couple thermal and electrical effects. In first place, a simple formula for the eccentricity decrement produced during each perigee pass as a function of TBT properties is derived and used to select TBT optimal dimensions. For a given tether mass, the formula shows that long tethers with small cross-section areas, but large enough to accomplish mechanical constraints, yield the best performance. Second, full numerical simulations of the deorbit maneuver including Lorentz force, air drag, and perturbations are carried out. A spinning thermionic bare tether with a mass of about 16 kg, as well as a length, width, and thickness equal to 6 km, 2 cm, and , respectively, passively deorbits a half-ton spacecraft (with a natural deorbit time of about 50 years) in less than six months, without using propellant, expellant, or power supply. The important roles played by the eclipses and the Earth’s oblateness on thermionic bare tether performance are highlighted.",33,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36253,"The operational lifetime of traditional Hall effect thrusters is limited by the erosion of the discharge channel walls. Erosion during long-duration life testing of Hall effect thrusters produces surface features that are unexplained by present models. Anomalous erosion ridges are one such unexplained feature. Hall effect thrusters are also expected to be under moderate (100 kPa to 6 MPa) thermomechanical stresses when operating, due to heat loads from the plasma. Thus, there may be a relationship between mechanical stress and the erosion features observed in Hall effect thrusters. This work investigates the plasma erosion of materials placed under mechanical loads. An experiment is designed to detect any changes to the erosion of material samples due to stress. Amorphous fused-silica samples are investigated in this paper. Fused silica erodes quickly and has no material heterogeneity. Three pairs of fused-silica samples, each pair with one control sample and one sample loaded to 6.0, 14.4, and , respectively, are exposed to argon plasma for 11 h, producing erosion depths of . Analysis of line scans made on the pre- and postexposure surfaces reveals the presence of a growth process operating on the initially roughened surface of the samples. Microscopy and line scans show the development of parabolic cells bounded by sharp-edged cusps. No difference is detected in the development of surface features between unloaded samples and samples loaded up to 25.0 MPa. A model of the evolution of the surface accurately reproduces the development of the cell pattern, by taking into account the angle dependence of the atomic sputtering yield, yielding surfaces similar to those observed experimentally.",33,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36197,"Paraffin stands out as a promising solid combustible grain for the classical hybrid propulsion rocket motor. However, its low mechanical properties increase the risk of grain cracking and rupturing. The purpose of this experimental study is to address the existing drawbacks by formulating paraffin particles within a hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene binder. Paraffin particles are prepared by crystallization in emulsion, which allows the control of particle size distribution, based on the droplets breakup and coalescence equilibrium. The paraffin particles are suspended in hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, and the maximum paraffin loading (62% volume fraction) is attained with the use of bimodal systems. A combustible grain (paraffin particles/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) is cast with the maximum loading and submitted to thermal and mechanical tests. The results are compared to hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and paraffin wax counterparts, and they meet the criteria of performance and safety required for this kind of combustible. The crystallization in paraffin-in-water emulsion proves to be an efficient method to prepare spherical paraffin particles with controllable sizes, which may be used to get bimodal systems that improve the packing of paraffin particles. The resulting combustible grain exhibits adequate thermal and mechanical properties (ultimate elongation of 206%) for a hybrid propulsion rocket motor.",33,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36292,"Theoretical and experimental methods were developed to investigate the charging characteristics anticipated to be observed on spacecraft during the operation of electrospray thrusters. These devices produce positively and negatively charged particles of similar mass and velocities. An electrical model of this configuration was created to predict the charging properties of electrically isolated systems. This model simulates a bipolar electrospray-thruster system. Experiments were conducted on a test bed, in which a mock-up satellite is magnetically levitated inside a vacuum chamber. The mock-up is equipped with batteries, power conditioning, radio transmitter, and electrospray thrusters. The results from the experimental tests demonstrate that neutralization with heavy ionic species is indeed possible. The thrusters are able to fire in a bipolar configuration for long periods of time inducing bounded spacecraft charging in the range from to when emitting currents of about . It was found that the presence of low-energy ions produced by the fragmentation of large clusters plays a significant role in the neutralization characteristics. This electrical model was verified by reproducing the experimental results, thus validating its use to estimate bulk spacecraft-charging properties.",33,2

Numerical simulations with two different inlet models are conducted. The results indicate that the local parameters govern the shock train’s motion, and the pressure gradient along the surface plays an extremely important role. The shock train’s location is determined by the entrance condition and backpressure, whereas it is the parameter along the surface that determines its path. The start and end positions of the rapid forward motion are located where the pressure gradient approaches zero. Streamwise parameters and the surface pressure gradient are introduced in Waltrup and Billig’s (“Structure of ShockWaves in Cylindrical Ducts,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 11, No. 10, 1973, pp. 1404–1408) empirical correlation to characterize the rapid forward motion.

20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36173,"In this study, the global and local flame responses to the acoustic perturbation were investigated to understand the thermoacoustic features of a low swirl flame. The effects of the Strouhal number and the acoustic perturbation level were examined. The global flame response was investigated with flame chemiluminescence. With the images captured with the planar laser-induced fluorescence of hydroxyl radicals method, the phase-averaged flame surface density was calculated to examine the flame dynamics and the local mean heat release oscillation. The results showed that the Strouhal number was useful in characterizing the flame responses: especially the oscillation amplitude. The flame showed a significant shape deformation when intense flame rollup happened; otherwise, the flame shape deformed weakly. The local analysis showed that large flame deformations caused strong local fundamental oscillations. However, the contribution of the local fundamental oscillation to the global fundamental fluctuation was affected by the local phase distribution, which was associated with the shape deformation characterized by the Strouhal number. The global first harmonic oscillation was generally much weaker than the global fundamental oscillation. The global first harmonic and fundamental oscillations only had comparable amplitudes when the intense local fundamental oscillations tended to cancel each other out.",33,2
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36280,"This paper compares the two dominant types of radiation from hydrogen flames under rocket-combustion conditions: ultraviolet and blue radiation. The physical sources of both types are scrutinized and basic modeling strategies are presented. Data were collected from four different combustors with pressures ranging up to 80 bar. The ultraviolet and blue radiations are discussed with regard to their spectral content between 290 and 430 nm; (self-) absorption; and total, spatial, and dynamic radiance. Both types of radiation are found to be strongly dependent on the ground-state hydroxyl-radical concentration, and the regions of emissivity are similar. Pressure is shown to have a higher impact on the emissivity of the blue radiation. Radiation from the hydroxyl radical is strongly influenced by self-absorption, thereby limiting the transparency of the flame. Recommendations for the interpretation of both types of flame radiation are given.",33,2
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36054,"In this paper, we present the results of an extensive measurement campaign to investigate the effects of external and internal sidewall compression and the variation of internal contraction on the performance and flowfield of a scramjet inlet. Experiments were conducted in the H2K wind tunnel of DLR, German Aerospace Center, in Cologne, Germany, at Mach 7. The performance was evaluated by static and total pressure ratios, kinetic energy efficiency, and mass capture ratios. The flowfield was analyzed using wall pressure distributions, pitot pressure, and Mach number profiles at the isolator interface to the combustion chamber and infrared thermography on the external ramps. The results show that the combination of a two-ramp inlet with external sidewall compression is not suitable for increasing the inlet’s compression capability as it induces strong separation and vortex structures in the external part, which strongly increase spillage and impair the starting behavior. Thus, no significant increases in internal contraction are possible, which inhibits any gains in the performance of the inlet. With internal sidewall compression, strong increases of the pressure ratio can be achieved at the cost of total pressure losses. With internal sidewall compression as well as without sidewall compression, the inlet is still self-starting at internal contraction ratios well above the Kantrowitz limit.",33,2

However, fundamental studies focusing on the pintle injector are rather limited, and the effects of key design parameters on combustion behaviors of the injector are still not identified. Therefore, combustion tests of an ethanol/liquid-oxygen rocket-engine combustor with a planar pintle injector are conducted to investigate the effects of total momentum ratio and on the combustion characteristics of the pintle injector. The total momentum ratio and vary from 1.0 to 2.2 and from 0.32 to 3.65, respectively, whereas the combustion pressure is kept constant at approximately 0.4 MPa. The spray structures are observed with high-speed cameras. The characteristic exhaust velocity efficiency increases with the increase in in the fuel-centered configuration, and the opposite tendency is observed in the oxidizer-centered configuration. The efficiency decreases with the increase in the total momentum ratio due to the impingement of propellant droplets on the combustor wall. The effect of the total momentum ratio on the efficiency is larger in the oxidizer-centered configuration than that in the fuel-centered configuration due to the difference in the amount of the impinging propellant. The atomization characteristics are improved as the propellant-injection velocity increases, which results in the high efficiency.",33,2

This analysis is based on a full-scale configuration at relevant flight conditions defined in previous vehicle-level system studies and component designs and includes the full propulsor geometry. A method to calculate the net thrust, equivalent power, and propulsive efficiency of boundary layer ingesting propulsion systems is presented and applied to the computational fluid dynamics solutions. It was found that the boundary layer ingesting system results in a propulsive efficiency benefit of 4.2–4.5% over that of a conventional propulsion system for the case of a fan designed primarily for aerodynamic performance. These results compare favorably to those predicted by engine cycle-based system studies and boundary layer ingesting theory and do not account for anticipated additional nacelle drag reduction benefits. It is recognized that future design work will be required to impart aeromechanics capability to the fan, and thus that the subject results provide an estimate of the upper benefit bound for a full-scale boundary layer ingesting propulsor in a relevant environment.",33,2
