Mean flow visualizations reveal a horseshoe vortex at the endwall-leading edge junction. The pressure side leg of the horseshoe vortex develops into a highly coherent passage vortex. The passage vortex is supported by a strong secondary flow that impinges on the endwall and spreads in the pitchwise direction. A dynamic mode decomposition reveals temporally growing three-dimensional modes that are susceptible to unsteady flow control. Based on the modal analysis and physical understanding of the mean flow topology, several different steady and unsteady flow control strategies were devised for weakening the passage vortex, countering the secondary flow, and reducing the suction side corner flow separation. Steady blowing that directly opposes the secondary flow effectively lowers the total pressure losses but requires large amplitudes, which makes it inefficient. Unsteady forcing is demonstrated to be an efficient way for decreasing the coherence of the passage vortex and for obtaining a moderate reduction of the total pressure losses.",35,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37283,"Research has shown that oxidizer swirl injection and liquefiable fuels, such as paraffin wax, can increase regression rates in hybrid rockets. However, there are few studies published on motors that use both these strategies simultaneously. This paper presents an exhaustive experimental investigation on the performance of a lab-scale hybrid rocket motor using paraffin wax and gaseous oxygen under a number of different conditions, including five different oxidizer injectors with varying levels of swirl. Prechamber length, fuel grain length, burn duration, oxidizer mass flow rate, and fuel grain geometry were modified from a baseline, and the influence on fuel regression and thrust oscillations was evaluated. Swirl injection increased regression rates up to 2.4 times that of the baseline axial injection configuration, while providing smoother operating conditions. The results show that thrust density of a hybrid rocket can be increased simultaneously by the use of a liquefying fuel and swirl injection. The results obtained also provide a unique experimental observation of the influence of several motor parameters on its performance, revealing that prechamber length and the angle of an entry slope on the grain do not contribute significantly to the performance or stability of the motor with swirl injection.",35,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37439,"This paper aims at investigations of thermomechanical fluid–structure interaction in regeneratively cooled rocket combustion chambers. In the first part the setup of a thermal cyclic fatigue experiment for rocket combustion chamber structures is described and discussed. This experiment has an actively cooled fatigue specimen that is mounted downstream of a subscale combustion chamber with a rectangular cross section. The fatigue specimen will be loaded cyclically and inspected after each cycle. The second part is devoted to the experimental results of two different test campaigns. In the first test campaign, appropriate test conditions for lifetime investigations are established. These test conditions are used for a cyclic loading in the second test campaign. The thermal and mechanical behavior of the fatigue specimen is described and discussed. An increasing plastic deformation during both test campaigns is measurable and is discussed.",35,5

The is a new concept that comes from the microcathode arc thruster , which implements the idea that an ablative anode can significantly improve the thrust-to-power ratio as a result of additional utilization of electron current flowing to and ablating the anode. Three versions of the were analyzed, and the results were presented and compared to the standard . Total ion current, ion velocity, and erosion rate measurement experiments were performed to characterize the thrusters. For the ion current evaluation, each combination was tested with three annular permanent magnets of differing strengths: 0.1, 0.143, and 0.3 T. All three thrusters achieved approximately 36% cathodic jet transport efficiency when equipped with the 0.1 T magnet. The result of the ion velocity testing showed that each system achieved similar ion velocities . The goal of this exercise was to determine if having an ablative anode, in addition to cathodic ablation, would increase ion current and velocity, therefore increasing specific impulse and thrust in comparison with the standard . From the experiments presented in this paper, this was found to be true.",35,5

In this work, electrospray plume mass spectra are compared between the monopropellant mixture and neat . This comparison clearly indicates new and additional species present in the plume due to the addition of HAN. Mass spectra from 20 to were obtained over a variety of angles and flow rates from to in both cation and anion extraction modes. Mass spectra dependence on flow rate and angular orientation agree qualitatively well with literature. Results indicate the presence of HAN-based species in anion mode, but no HAN-based species in cation mode. Three of the four monomer species from the monopropellant are apparent in the plume; , , and are observed, whereas is noticeably absent. Results also show emission of both proton-transferred covalent forms of HAN: [HA-H] and . Swapping of anion and cation species between the constituents of the monopropellant mixture is also observed.",35,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37536,"In liquid rocket engines, wall heat transfer analyses are of primary importance for the thrust chamber design. Numerical investigations usually derive the convective heat flux from computational fluid dynamics simulations, whereas the radiative counterpart is often neglected. The goal of the present paper is a systematic numerical investigation on the role of radiative heat transfer on the overall thermal loads occurring in the thrust chamber of liquid rocket engines. To this purpose, a numerical code for thermal radiation computations is coupled to a computational fluid dynamics solver. The results of the numerical setup are discussed and compared to the available literature’s numerical data. Then, the radiative contribution to the overall heat flux in the thrust chamber of oxygen/hydrogen and oxygen/methane liquid rocket engines is investigated through a wide parametric analysis. The results show that, in typical operating conditions, the radiative heat load is proportionally greater in methane-fueled engines than in hydrogen-fueled engines, and that the radiative contribution to the overall wall heat flux becomes increasingly relevant for large-scale low-chamber-pressure engines. A methodology for a quick preliminary evaluation of the radiative wall heat flux in liquid rocket thrust chambers is finally presented and verified against coupled simulations.",35,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37391,"Nitrous oxide has gained popularity as a unique oxidizer for propulsion applications due to its ability to decompose exothermically, producing nitrogen and oxygen. In the current work, the flame acceleration, deflagration-to-detonation transition, and detonation properties of bipropellant mixtures with as the oxidizer are studied for potential applications in pulsed blowdown and detonation-driven thrusters. These properties are compared with those in mixtures with oxygen or nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer. The performance of versus for detonation engine applications is investigated using theoretical Chapman–Jouguet detonation calculations of bipropellant systems with ethylene and acetylene as fuels. A critical requirement for the application of bipropellant mixtures to pulsed propulsion systems is rapid flame acceleration to achieve significant chamber pressure rise in a short distance with the potential for a prompt transition to detonation. This deflagration-to-detonation transition behavior of mixtures using and with and is investigated for increasing initial pressures in the experimental portion of this work. While is a highly energetic fuel with theoretically high performance, it presents serious practical storage concerns when considered for propulsion applications. These practical issues motivate investigation of as a potential alternative fuel, which is relatively easy to manage. The precompression of the bipropellant mixtures during flame acceleration is also estimated and compared.",35,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37472,"Combustion of ethylene was examined experimentally via semi-freejet testing of a fundamental, axisymmetric combustor model at conditions representative of Mach 7–8 flight at 100 kPa dynamic pressure. The model consisted of diffuser, constant area isolator, cavity, and diverging combustor sections. Pressure data were measured along the wall of the model and were complemented with OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) visualization at the exit of the diverging section. Robust combustion of ethylene was observed for two stagnation enthalpy cases for fuel-air equivalence ratios of 0.3 or greater. A low-enthalpy, low-equivalence-ratio case showed significant, but structurally different, OH PLIF signals even though there was little combustion-induced pressure rise. Edge-detection techniques were applied to the PLIF images, and the resulting circumferential distributions analyzed. Mean radii and standard deviations are presented for the inner and outer edges of the OH-rich band for four tunnel/fueling conditions. Finally, amplitude spectra of fluctuations in the edge radii are shown, indicating that low-wavenumber oscillations are dominant. These experimental results provide useful data for comparison with numerical simulation in future studies.",35,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37431,"Biphasic dispersion fuels (BDFs) are multiphase mixtures in which liquid droplets are trapped in a solid binder to form stable hybrid propellant grains. As the flame transfers heat to the fuel grain surface, the internal pressure of the liquid droplets rises, leading to microexplosions that force small droplets and fuel vapors into the flame zone. The combined effects of the liquid fuel being dispersed in the combustion chamber and the craters formed by surface-level microexplosions should lead to high combustion efficiencies and high regression rates. As an initial step in developing BDF, nonionic surfactants and a high shear homogenizing unit were used to emulsify water and ethanol in paraffin wax. The mixtures were cooled and casted into cylindrical fuel grains, and their performance was evaluated with gaseous oxygen in an optically accessible hybrid rocket motor. Results indicate that both BDF formulations exhibited increased regression rates, relative to neat paraffin wax, at all oxidizer mass fluxes tested. The water-based fuels demonstrated up to a 32% increase in regression rate and a 1% increase in average combustion efficiency, relative to neat paraffin fuels. The ethanol-based fuels demonstrated up to a 95% increase in regression rate and a 4% decrease in average combustion efficiency, relative to neat paraffin fuels.",35,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37324,"A 1-D numerical compressible fluid model was created to simulate self-sustained decomposition of nitrous oxide. The model uses a preheated, thermally conductive metal foam as an alternative to catalysts. An extensive parameter study was conducted to help understand thermal and fluid effects on steady-state decompositions. Using a copper metal foam, steady-state solutions simulated successful nitrous oxide decomposition, with an exit gas temperature around 1345 K. Simulations were extended to other high-temperature metal foams with different thermal conductivities and melting points. Modeling flow rate conditions more representative of current monopropellant thrusters required scaling of the decomposition chamber in order to be self-sustaining.",35,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37517,"Electric solid propellants are advanced solid chemical rocket propellants that can be controlled (ignited, throttled, and extinguished) through the application and removal of an electric current. Electric solid propellants are also being considered for pulsed arc ablation electric thrusters, such as the pulsed plasma thruster. The focus of this work is the electrical and ablation characteristics of electric solid propellant within an arc discharge. Arc discharges of 5–20 J per pulse were created within a cylindrical cavity, and results for the electric solid propellant are compared with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is a traditional propellant in ablative pulsed plasma thrusters. The data indicate that the electric solid propellant has higher specific ablation per pulse relative to PTFE , which quantitatively agrees with an ablation energy balance model. For both propellants, the equivalent circuit resistance and inductance of the plasma arc are 50 mΩ and 125 nH, respectively. Analyses are presented indicating that the physics of propellant ablation is similar for both propellants with the differences in the observed specific ablation owing to differences in the thermodynamic properties between propellants.",35,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37490,"The prediction of thermo-acoustic instabilities is of paramount importance for gas-turbine combustion systems to meet the emission and efficiency targets. To predict the frequencies and amplitudes of pressure oscillations, and as a consequence, their impact on engine reliability, the nonlinear behavior of the system should be studied. An atmospheric lean-premixed combustor has been numerically investigated for validation purposes. A decoupled approach, separating the acoustic behavior and the nonlinear flame response, which is represented in this work by the flame describing function, has been used. As the first step, the flame describing function calculation from large-eddy simulations has been validated, including the effects of flame stretch and heat loss into the turbulence combustion model. Then, frequency-domain calculations using a three-dimensional Helmholtz solver have been carried out, and results have been validated against experimental measurements and a self-excited large-eddy simulation.",35,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37491,"This paper examines the effect of single protrusion and multiprotrusion on the performance of hybrid rocket with the length/initial port diameter ratio of 12.5. The fuel used was wax, and the oxidizer was gaseous oxygen. The protrusion used was made of nylon and it regresses during the combustion. The result indicates that the use of single protrusion placed downstream locations (0.5 to 0.8 ) is prominent in enhancing the regression rate as well as the combustion efficiency. Among the various protrusion combinations, the highest improvement in regression rate is obtained with the three protrusion (0.2–0.5–0.8 ) combination. Use of protrusions beyond three was found to be ineffective for the given ratio of the hybrid rocket. Overall, the highest improvement in combustion efficiency was obtained for the double-protrusion case at 0.2–0.8 and it was around 73%. The mass flux exponent for all the protrusion combinations was close to 0.5, which is the essential requirement for the hybrid rocket motor. Apart from these studies, the effect of protrusion height with graphite protrusion has also been carried out with single protrusion. It has been observed that the protrusion height of 7 mm gives relatively highest improvement in regression rate as well as the combustion efficiency.",35,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37549,"The objective of this study was to explore particulate matter (PM) emissions of a piston-engine aircraft under different speed points and fuel mixtures. Collected directly from the exhaust duct, concentrations at the filters reveal different profiles and ranges between 14.1 and depending on engine speed and mixture. A new parameter, the accumulation color index (ACI), was developed to scale the tonal change of a polytetrafluoroethylene filter exposed to exhaust gases for a specific period of time and volumetric flow. Being sensitive to mixture type, the highest and lowest ACI scores are generally observed at 2000 and 1000–1250 rpm, respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses indicate that, regardless of fuel mixture, the main elements that shape the composition at filters are found to be carbon (C), bromine (Br), lead (Pb), oxygen, aluminum, and, to a lesser extent, chlorine. However, mixture and engine speed significantly affect the size, geometry, and intensity of the particles. Highly significant correlations are obtained, under full-rich mixture, between atomic percentage and fuel flow, engine speed, and ACI. On average, Pb and Br are observed as higher in best-power mixture. The Br/Pb is obtained as 1.2–2.2 for best-power and 1.2–1.9 for full-rich mixtures, depending on speed points.",35,5
