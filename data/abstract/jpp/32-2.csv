To this end, it is first shown that all open-rotor and shrouded wind turbines and propellers can be represented analytically as members of a single general family. Thereafter, power harvesting and thrusting predictions for both wind turbines and propellers, respectively, are reduced to solutions of pairs of polynomial equations, for which exact numerical solutions are provided. Additionally, easily applied, semiempirical, and closed-form perturbation solutions are provided. For wind turbines, it is shown that even small blockage levels can induce appreciable correction factors, whereas for propellers, blockage corrections were found to be negligibly small for all practical blockage levels.",32,2

Experimental and numerical investigation of the solid-fuel rocket scramjet combustor was conducted to evaluate its performance. The experiment simulated a flight environment of Mach 4 at a 17 km altitude. Magnesium-based solid fuel was used as propellant in this study. The results show that secondary combustion occurs in supersonic combustor. The combustion efficiency of the propellant is about 65%, and the total pressure recovery is about 0.5. These imply that the scramjet configuration using solid fuel as a propellant is feasible. The results of the numerical analysis show that a normal shock wave is generated in the core flow of the combustor, and this is due to all of the fuel-rich gas being injected in the same cross section.",32,2

This paper demonstrates several methods for characterizing and comparing dynamic combustion response from experiment and simulation. A model rocket combustor that exhibits self-excited instabilities is used for the study. Comparisons are made for two configurations: one stable and one unstable. High-speed chemiluminescence imaging from the experiment was first phase averaged, then treated with an Abel inversion routine to produce a dynamic two-dimensional distribution of heat addition. The distribution before inversion could be compared with line-integrated calculations of the heat release rate from three-dimensional large-eddy simulations, and after inversion to azimuthally averaged cross sections from simulations. Modal decomposition of the two-dimensional distributions was performed and compared. The applicability and limitations of each comparison approach are assessed.",32,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35420,"The effect of density ratio, velocity ratio, momentum ratio, and fuel composition on the susceptibility of shear coaxial flames to periodic pressure waves is studied experimentally. A turbulent diffusion flame, established in an atmospheric-pressure, two-dimensional, shear coaxial combustor, is acoustically forced by a transversely mounted compression driver, and the level of flame acoustic interaction is quantified using chemiluminescence imaging. The parameter of interest is varied by diluting the propellants with helium, argon, or methane by appropriate amounts while holding other parameters relatively constant. Flame response is found to vary exponentially with density ratio, whereas it is found to vary linearly with velocity ratio and fuel composition, at least within the limited ranges tested. Flame response is found to vary exponentially when momentum ratio is varied by varying density ratio, whereas it is found to vary linearly when momentum ratio is varied by varying velocity ratio. Overall, our results support the notions that propellant density ratio is a critical parameter affecting shear coaxial flame–acoustic interactions and that a reduction in propellant density ratio could improve the stability of combustors using such injectors.",32,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35701,"In the present study, planar laser-induced acetone fluorescence was used to quantify the streamwise concentration distribution of an ethylene fuel surrogate (acetone-seeded nitrogen) injected directly into the recirculation region of a cavity flameholder embedded in a nonreacting supersonic airflow. The effect of injection configuration and fueling rate were studied. Parallel injection from the cavity front wall resulted in an ultra-fuel-rich recirculation region (beyond the upper flammability limit of an ethylene–air mixture) with a mixing efficiency that degraded with increased fueling rate. Downstream angled injection from the cavity floor yielded a substantial improvement in terms of the spatial uniformity and flammability of the local mixture. Its mixing efficiency was observed to be independent of fueling rate. The superior mixing ability of the latter injection configuration has the potential to provide increased cavity flameholder operability through a broader range of ignition and blowout limits and more flexibility in terms of ignitor placement than conventional direct-fueling schemes. Further investigation of its performance over a wider range of reacting conditions is warranted.",32,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35690,"Results of an experimental investigation of axisymmetric jet that was subjected to radial and azimuthal forcing at a Reynolds number of 5200 are reported. Subharmonic forcing at Strouhal numbers of 0.1 and 0.125 attenuated large coherent structures in the initial region of the jet, resulting in an overall reduction in turbulence levels and the turbulent kinetic energy. Forcing also resulted in the velocity decay and spreading of the jet. Proper orthogonal decomposition analysis of the particle image velocimetry data revealed exchange of modal energy to higher modes and highlighted streamwise vortex filaments located between successive large-scale structures of the jet. These filaments play a pivotal role in the entrainment of ambient fluid. The meandering and distortion of the vortex filaments increased due to additional strain imposed by the forcing.",32,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35572,"The unsteady aerodynamics of low-pressure turbine vibrating airfoils in flap mode is studied in detail using a frequency-domain linearized Navier–Stokes solver. Both the traveling-wave and influence coefficient formulations of the problem are used to highlight key aspects of the physics and understand the trends of the modulus and phase of unsteady pressure with the reduced frequency and Mach number. The study is focused in the low reduced-frequency regime, which is of paramount relevance for the design of aeronautical low-pressure turbines and compressors. It is concluded that the variation of the influence coefficient phase with the reduced frequency is linear, whereas the effect of the Mach number can be neglected in the first order approximation; moreover, the unsteadiness of the vibrating and adjacent airfoils is driven by vortex shedding mechanisms. Finally, a simple model to estimate the work per cycle as a function of the reduced frequency and Mach number is provided for bending modes. The edgewise and torsion modes are presented in less detail, but it is shown that acoustic waves are essential to explain its behavior. The nondimensional work per cycle of the edgewise mode shows a weak dependence with the Mach number, whereas in the torsion mode, a large number of airfoils is needed to reconstruct the work per cycle departing from the influence coefficients, and the mean value is Mach independent.",32,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35849,"Self-pressurized nitrous oxide feed systems have gained the attention of many rocket designers because of their overall simplicity and low mass. A study of temperature stratification in tanks during evacuation is important for the modeling of a self-pressurized nitrous oxide system. In this study, an experimental apparatus has been constructed with a series of temperature sensors equally distributed in the tank’s axial direction to measure stratification and with a set of load cells to measure the nitrous oxide mass flow rate. The response time of the temperature sensor in water is also measured and is evaluated in the test. The temperature distribution in the tank is measured during the filling and evacuation processes. It is observed that temperature stratification in the liquid region is so small that it can be modeled with a lumped parameter node. However, the stratification will always occur in the vapor region, making it insufficient to be modeled with a lumped parameter node. The saturation temperature based on the pressure in the tank is marginally higher than that in the liquid.",32,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35792,"Understanding ignition and flame propagation in multisector combustors is critical for aeronautical gas turbine manufacturers. To study this problem, large-eddy simulations using an Euler–Euler approach for sprays were performed in a trisector configuration. The sensitivity of the simulation to the injection diameter, the energy input to the mixture, and the time of fueling were assessed. The flame structure following ignition was shown to be complex and time dependent. The flame propagation through the chamber was analyzed using a formulation for the velocity of isosurfaces of temperature, showing that it was dominated by the gas velocity. In particular, both the swirling flow issuing from the injectors and the dilatation effect that modifies the gas flow aid the flame propagation through the chamber.",32,2

Glenn Research Center of a low-boom supersonic inlet have been analyzed and compared to computational results generated using a detached eddy simulation methodology based on the Nichols–Nelson model. The objective of this study is to better understand the capability of this methodology and the source of significant external shock oscillations. The external-compression axisymmetric inlet includes a relaxed-compression spike followed first by a short subsonic diffuser to the aerodynamic interface plane that represents the inflow face of an engine and then by a long low-speed diffuser that terminates in the mass flow plug. The flow conditions for the experiments and simulations were based on a Mach 1.67 freestream coupled with 4.5% spillage (higher than the 1.5% on-design spillage condition). A 10 deg flow sector was modeled with a three-dimensional structured grid and solved with the WIND-US code. The time-averaged computational flowfield was not sensitive to including the low-speed diffuser domain, but this extra length was important for unsteady characteristics (especially pressure waves). Computations and experiments showed these waves originated downstream and propagated upstream, initially as weak acoustic waves, but led to strong pressure oscillations due to shock motion, as well as significant complexity in the transonic region near the throat.",32,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35760,"Nitric oxide planar laser-induced fluorescence measurements have been performed in a small-scale scramjet combustor at the University of Virginia Aerospace Research Laboratory at nominal simulated Mach 5 flight. A mixture of nitric oxide and nitrogen was injected at the upstream end of the inlet isolator as a surrogate for ethylene fuel, and the mixing of this fuel simulant was studied with and without a shock train. The shock train was produced by an air throttle, which simulated the blockage effects of combustion downstream of the cavity flameholder. Nitric oxide planar laser-induced fluorescence signal was imaged in a plane orthogonal to the freestream at the leading edge of the cavity. Instantaneous planar images were recorded and analyzed to identify the most uniform cases, which were achieved by varying the location of the fuel injection and shock train. This method was used to screen different possible fueling configurations to provide optimized test conditions for follow-on combustion measurements using ethylene fuel. A theoretical study of the selected nitric oxide rotational transitions was performed to obtain a laser-induced fluorescence signal that was linear with the nitric oxide mole fraction and approximately independent of the pressure and temperature.",32,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35739,"A rotary-valved four-cylinder pulse detonation rocket engine system, Todoroki II, was developed, in which two novel techniques, the use of an inflow-driven motor and an inverted oxidizer cylinder, were introduced. The total length of the system was 1910 mm; its total weight when filled with ethylene–nitrous-oxide propellant and helium purge gas was 32.5 kg; and the engine weight was 9.6 kg. In a ground firing test with a duration of 1500 ms, a thrust-to-engine-weight ratio of 2.7 was achieved. Thus, it was demonstrated that a multicylinder pulse detonation rocket engine system can be used as a practical thrust mechanism. Using a launch and recovery system, a flight-simulating test was conducted to evaluate the features and viability of the engine design. The launch and recovery system operated perfectly, and Todoroki II reached a height of about 9.7 m. The operation of the pulse detonation rocket engine under conditions simulating real vertical flight without constraint forces with a duration of about 1200 ms and a thrust-to-engine-weight ratio of 2.5 was demonstrated. No serious impact of the vibration caused by the pulse detonation rocket engine operation or the rotation of the rotary valve on the flight was observed.",32,2

The thrust output from three prototype devices, two emitting the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and one emitting 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-tetrafluoroborate, was measured directly using a precise balance. Thrusts up to were measured when emitting 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide in a bipolar, alternating potential configuration at less than 0.8 W input power and with propellant supplied from an internal reservoir. Measurements of mass spectra via time-of-flight spectrometry, angle resolved current distributions, ion fragmentation, and energy deficits have been applied to accurately calculate thrust and mass flow rates indirectly from the same devices. For two of the three cases, calculated and directly measured thrusts were in agreement to within a few micronewtons at input powers from 0.1 to 0.8 W. Emissions of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-tetrafluoroborate were shown to yield nearly purely ionic beams supporting high propulsive efficiencies and specific impulses of and greater than 3200 s, respectively, at 0.5 W. Conversely, greater polydispersity was observed in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide emissions, contributing to reduced specific performance, propulsive efficiency, and specific impulse at 0.5 W.",32,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35771,"The thrust performance of airframe-integrated linear aerospike propulsion systems for high-speed aircraft operated under off-design in-flight conditions was evaluated, based on performance prediction models established for linear aerospike nozzles by accounting for the freestream effect. The airframe configuration, equipped with a boattail appearing to the right upstream of the primary cell nozzle exit, enabled the freestream effect to be used for increasing the spike surface pressure. Performances of each thrust component were predicted by using the physics-based models established in separately performed studies. First, a parametric study was conducted on a rocket primary thruster with various design parameters. Then, an advanced concept with an airbreathing primary propulsion system was evaluated for its feasibility by comparing its thrust performance with that of a conventional rocket primary thruster. The benefit of the aerospike nozzle integrated into the airframe was also evaluated by comparing its thrust to a configuration without the aerospike nozzle. Results showed that the employment of the aerospike nozzle offered improved performance from takeoff to cruise phases. The advanced concept using the bypass airbreathing system for the primary thruster followed by the aerospike configuration exhibited further improvement in thrust by compensating for the boattail drag.",32,2

The eigensystem has been computed by Powell’s technique, and an optimized monotonic upstream-centered scheme for conservation laws has been applied to achieve a high-resolution method. Also, a one-dimensional description of a collisionless sheath has been taken into account to predict the anode fall voltage. In this study, the argon plasma propellant, with mass flow rate of , has been considered to be in thermal and chemical nonequilibrium states. For the discharge current of 16 kA, the values of fall voltage, electric field, and Hall parameter have been respectively predicted about 3.75 V, , and 1 at the anode midlip. The simulated hot spots near the anode and cathode, the inner flow of ions around the cathode, and the exhaust plume structure have been captured in good agreement with the other corresponding experimental and numerical results. Moreover, the anode fall voltages have been obtained by less than 10.5% difference compared with the measured values. Furthermore, the inverse dependence between the anode fall and current density has been numerically predicted well in comparison with the measurements.",32,2

The influences of concentration, the decomposition rate, and pressure on the chemical delay were investigated. The ignition delay time had the negative temperature coefficient phenomenon for a low decomposition rate, and the increasing pressure weakened the negative temperature coefficient phenomenon, which nearly disappeared when the pressure was greater than 4 MPa. An -dependent coefficient of the ignition delay time was almost not influenced by concentration and pressure when the pressure was less than 4 MPa, and had a noticeable influence on the ignition delay time at . Increasing the concentration effectively reduced the ignition delay time at , but it had a slight effect on the ignition delay time at .",32,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35880,"The spark ignition and flame stabilization of kerosene in a dual-cavity scramjet combustor is investigated with the isolator entrance Mach number of 2.52, total pressure of 1.6 MPa, and stagnation temperature of 1486 K, which corresponds to flight condition. The effects of dual-cavity configuration on ignition and flameholding were analyzed. Two distinct cavity-organized flame regimes were found: cavity flame and cavity shear-layer flame. The driving force of the transition of flame stabilization mode from cavity flame to cavity shear-layer flame is the high pressure resulted from combustion, which occurs in the cavity. The dual-cavity flameholding scheme can promote the ignition ability. First, the downstream cavity could stabilize the flame convected from the upstream cavity. Second, compared with the upstream cavity, the downstream cavity is a more suitable ignition location because the fuel has a longer distance for evaporation and mixing. The boundary-layer separation and upstream moving of precombustion shock train are responsible for the contraflow flame propagation process. Also, an unstable boundary-layer/cavity-stabilized combustion is found during the flame transition process. This phenomenon results from the interaction between the cavity recirculation zones and the separation zone immediately upstream of T1 cavity, which is caused by the strong shock/boundary-layer interactions, as the shock train is pushed upstream.",32,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35773,"The performance of the swirl atomizers largely depends on the spray characteristics of the liquid sheets. In this context, a modified linear instability analysis accounting for the weak form of the centrifugal force along the flow direction is proposed and the breakup length of the conical liquid sheets is predicted. The investigation depends on the dispersion relation that covers both the viscous and the inviscid liquid sheets, with different wave modes (sinuous and varicose) and wave approximations (long and short). A newly identified transition zone across the long- and short-wave instability defines the liquid Weber number limit as . A breakup length relation accounting for the attenuating effect of the conical liquid sheets is formulated, and the results obtained from the theoretical breakup model were validated with the available experiment data in the literature. In brief, this paper elaborates the instability phenomenon in terms of relations and solutions. As found in the literature, this paper also notifies the destabilizing role of the density ratio and the stabilizing role of viscosity in the disturbance growth analysis.",32,2

Metal particles are occasionally added to the fuel in order to increase thrust. For the complete combustion of metal particles in the second combustion chamber, it is important to understand the mixing characteristics in the chamber’s recirculation zone. In this study, the effects of the mixing chamber geometry and velocity ratio on the flow in the chamber were investigated using particle image velocimetry. A total of four mixing chamber geometries and three velocity ratios were considered, and the effects of the size of the metal fuel-simulating particles were also investigated. The experimental results showed that the size of the recirculation zone and the fuel penetration depth were strongly affected by the location of the axial inlet and the size of the particles. As particle size increased, the size of the recirculation zone increased due to the increased momentum of the axial flow. The effects of chamber geometry and velocity ratio on the flow were significant near the mixing region. However, the effects diminished downstream.",32,2

However, the prediction of the hypersonic inlet self-starting limit is generally difficult. This paper proposes a flow-based prediction approach for the self-starting limiting internal contraction ratio of two-dimensional hypersonic inlets. The key lies in the establishment of a general approximate expression for the fluid dynamic blockage, caused by the migration of the primary separation bubble down the internal contraction portion of the inlet. Formulas for the fluid dynamic blockage and the limiting internal contraction ratio are given. The predicted results are in good agreement with the published experimental results on hypersonic inlet starting.",32,2
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35858,"The axial gap between blade rows in turbomachinery should be minimized in order to reduce size requirements and increase efficiency; although, there is a tradeoff between gap width and flow steadiness. The aerodynamic interaction between rotors and stators influences system performance under both steady and transient conditions. To investigate the basic physical mechanisms associated with the rotor/stator interaction, an efficient numerical scheme for solving unsteady, viscous flows on a quasi-three-dimensional coordinate system is established using an immersed boundary method. The data transfer between moving and stationary grids that slip against each other in traditional numerical methods is avoided. The effects of the axial gap between adjacent blade rows are studied by considering the flow evolution through a rotor and stator stage in different Reynolds number regimes. Results indicate that reduced blade gap leads to high lift on the rotor blade and improved stage loading. At the same time, the rotor/stator interaction increases flow unsteadiness, which may in turn increase noise and vibration. It is found that the reduced blade gap does not always improve performance, in spite of the generation of vortex lift. The present work provides guidelines for optimization of the axial gap between blade rows for turbomachinery design.",32,2
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35859,"Conventional aerodynamic theory of lift is based on the Kutta–Joukowski condition, in which the lift and drag coefficients are predicted based on the assumption that flow is attached and steady-state. Recent research on insect flight indicates, however, that the unsteady motion of a wing can generate much higher unsteady aerodynamic force through the flow induced by the shedding vortices. In the present work, therefore, we propose a novel type of stage consisting of rotor and periodically pitched stator to take advantage of unsteady vortex lift. The numerical results suggest that the flowfield around the leading and trailing edges of the blades are substantially modified by the interactions between the rotor and pitching stator. Several transient lift peaks can be generated for each period. If an appropriate pitching phase is chosen for the stator, stage performance can be improved through unsteady lift mechanism effects.",32,2

Performance critical design parameters include injector geometry, combustor layout, fuel–air mixing, and engine cycle conditions. The present investigation explores these factors and their impact on a radially staged low-emission aviation combustor sized for a next-generation 24,000-lbf-thrust engine. By coupling multifidelity computational tools, a design exploration was performed using a parameterized annular combustor sector at projected 100% takeoff power conditions. Design objectives included nitrogen oxide emission indices and overall combustor pressure loss. From the design space, an optimal configuration was selected and simulated at 7.1, 30, and 85% part-power operation, corresponding to landing–takeoff cycle idle, approach, and climb segments. All results were obtained by solution of the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Species concentrations were solved directly using a reduced 19-step reaction mechanism for Jet A. Turbulence closure was obtained using a nonlinear model. This research demonstrates revolutionary combustor design exploration enabled by multifidelity physics-based simulation.",32,2
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35898,"To estimate the effects of combustion-induced backpressure on the pseudoshock oscillation within a scramjet inlet isolator, a computational-fluid-dynamics code was used to study the motions of pseudoshock under different sinusoidal dynamic backpressures. The relations of the pseudoshock oscillation with the pressure histories, standard deviation, and spectral density distributions were explored. Second, the impact of frequency and amplitude of dynamic backpressure on the pseudoshock oscillation was investigated. The results show that the leading edge of the oscillating pseudoshock is not at the place where maximum values of standard deviation and spectral density occur because sinusoidal dynamic backpressure is applied at the exit of the isolator. Moreover, the frequencies of dynamic backpressure have minor influence on the maximum upstream position of the pseudoshock leading edge with the increase of frequency. In comparison, the amplitudes of the dynamic backpressures have great impact on the maximum upstream and downstream locations of the pseudoshock leading edge. It was also revealed that, although the flowfields as well as the locations of pseudoshock leading edge are quite different, the standard deviation and spectral density distributions are nearly the same for the case of sinusoidal backpressure applied.",32,2
