5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35034,"Piezoelectric initiators are a unique form of ignition for energetic material because the current and voltage are tied together by impact loading on the crystal. This study examines the ignition response of an energetic composite composed of aluminum and molybdenum trioxide nanopowders to the arc generated from a lead zirconate and lead titanate piezocrystal. The mechanical stimuli used to activate the piezocrystal varied to assess ignition voltage, power, and delay time of aluminum–molybdenum trioxide for a range of bulk powder densities. Results show a high dielectric strength leads to faster ignition times because of the higher voltage delivered to the energetic. Ignition delay is under 0.4 ms, which is faster than observed with thermal or shock ignition. Electric ignition of composite energetic materials is a strong function of interparticle connectivity, and thus the role of bulk density on electrostatic discharge ignition sensitivity is a focus of this study. Results show that the ignition delay times are dependent on the powder bulk density with an optimum bulk density of 50%. Packing fractions and electrical conductivity were analyzed and aid in explaining the resulting ignition behavior as a function of bulk density.",30,1

A subscale cold flow experimental condition where nozzle damping coefficients are evaluated through the pulse decay method is taken as a validation case. The flowfield of the motor is simulated by solving three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations using commercial computational fluid dynamics software. The trend of the pressure decay in the head end is well captured for different values of port-to-throat area ratios, and a very good match is obtained between the computed and experimental values of the nozzle decay coefficient. Validated methodology is used to evaluate the damping coefficient of a burning solid rocket motor with composite propellant.",30,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34212,"The authors have demonstrated tunable diode laser spectroscopy measurements of temperature and water concentration with spatial resolution at the nozzle exit of an augmented gas turbine engine for the first time. Spatial resolution was achieved by performing tunable diode laser path-averaged measurements over 12 separate angles with the engine in ground idle and afterburner mode. Anomalies in the final time-averaged images indicate recurring plume structures, such as hot streaks and cold spots. Although temporal resolution was not demonstrated in this preliminary work, a system has been defined that should produce update rates up to 1 kHz, thereby enabling the study of augmenter combustion dynamics. Two-dimensional images of CO, , and should also be measureable at slower update rates with good spatial resolution. The authors believe that such measurements have the potential to reduce the time required to diagnose engine malfunctions and assess the efficacy of engine maintenance, repair, and overhaul.",30,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34567,"This paper describes measurements of performance characteristics of micro-cathode arc thruster. In particular, influence of an applied magnetic field on the impulse bit, specific impulse, and the mass consumption is investigated. The micro-cathode arc thruster was operated in a quasi-steady-state mode to ensure that a measurable thrust stand deflection was produced. It was found that the impulse bit increases from about in the case without a magnetic field up to about in the case of a magnetic field of about 0.3 T. A magnetic field leads to an increase of the mass consumption from about at zero magnetic field up to about at a magnetic field of about 0.3 T. Average ion velocity is measured to be about (at ) and about (at ). Maximum efficiency of the thruster is estimated to be about 7%.",30,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34870,NASA is continuing to develop high-power Hall thrusters in the range of 20 to 100 kW for future cargo and manned missions. The cathodes for these thrusters will be required to produce discharge currents in the 50 to 300 A range with lifetimes in excess of 10 kh. A prototype high-current hollow cathode with a 2-cm-diam lanthanum hexaboride insert was previously developed for these applications. The original design featured a graphite cathode tube to interface with the insert and an insulated sheath heater capable of heating the higher temperature emitter to ignition temperatures. A new version of this cathode has been designed and built that uses a refractory metal cathode tube and features a robust design similar to the small cathode used for the H6 Hall thruster. The new cathode has been successfully tested at steady-state discharge currents from 25 to 300 A. This cathode is intended to be used in an 80 kW nested Hall thruster being built at the University of Michigan at discharge currents of over 250 A.,30,1

Based on experimental studies, a model of a pulsed-detonation combustor, and a prototype of industrial burners of a new generation, which produces a combined shock wave (mechanical) and thermal effect on objects blown on with combustion products, has been designed, constructed, and tested. Reported are the results of experiments demonstrating the pulsed-detonation combustor operation process in terms of cyclic detonation initiation via deflagration-to-detonation transition, as well as pulsed-detonation combustor thermal regime during long-duration (300 s) testing without forced cooling. The results provide a basis for further work aimed at increasing the operation frequency and thermal power of pulsed-detonation combustors for different industrial (metallurgy, chemical engineering, waste incineration, etc.) and propulsion applications.",30,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35037,"Boron is a beneficial fuel for propellants and explosives because of its high energy density. However, efficient combustion of boron particles is difficult to obtain because of an inhibiting oxide layer that covers the particles. Various metal oxides are active catalysts in graphite/carbon oxidation, but no study has been carried out to investigate metal oxides as catalysts for boron oxidation. In this paper, the effects of metal oxides on boron oxidation are introduced. The instruments used in the experiments include a thermobalance, FactSage 6.2 software, and a laser ignition facility. The results reveal that is the most active catalyst: it can reduce the ignition temperature by 15.2%. and are the second and third most active catalysts, respectively. The other four metal oxides used in the experiments exhibit little activity on boron thermal oxidation. The catalytic action of metal oxides possibly involves the cyclic reduction of the metal oxides and the reoxidation of the resulting metals. The catalysts help transfer oxygen from the surroundings to the interface. All metal oxides used in the experiments help decrease boron ignition delay time. Two reasons are proposed to interpret the effect of metal oxides on the boron ignition delay time.",30,1

The modified numerical simulation consists of a one-dimensional Lagrangian radiation hydrodynamic code to calculate the creation process of laser-produced plasma and a three-dimensional hybrid particle-in-cell code. The original numerical simulation does not consider the creation process. The measured impulse bit due to the interaction between the diamagnetic current in a laser-produced plasma and the magnetic field generated by neodymium permanent magnets is . The calculated impulse bit in the modified and original numerical simulations is 10.3 and , respectively. These results reveal that the modified numerical simulation models closer to the experiment than the original numerical simulation. In addition, to investigate the effect of the magnetic field strength on the plasma behavior in a magnetic thrust chamber system for a laser fusion rocket, the modified numerical simulation is performed. As a result, it is revealed that there is an approximation region of the magnetic field strength for high thrust performance.",30,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34958,"In-flight oxygen collection enables a significant reduction in takeoff gross weight of space launchers, thereby allowing airplane-like operations. This paper describes the development and tests of a compact rotary air separation device that constitutes a part of a functional oxygen collection plant. The experimental results are described in detail, demonstrating a consistent and long duration operation of the device yielding a high purity of liquid enriched air (96% oxygen) while causing only very small pressure drops on the gaseous phase. The tests indicate that the height of a so-called ideal tray for the current device is around 1 to 2 cm of core foam material, which is an improvement of one order of magnitude compared with previous designs. The experimental results are scaled up and applied to two different two stage to orbit launch vehicles. It is shown that a complete oxygen collection plant for a subsonic collection phase would weigh around 4 tons and occupy approximately , which represents less than 1% of the vehicle takeoff weight and a specific mass and volume, respectively, of and of liquid oxygen generated. For a supersonic collection, a much bigger collection plant is required due to a much higher oxygen production rate, and further improvements are required to reduce its system mass and volume despite a reduction in both specific mass and volume.",30,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34988,"An experimental study was conducted in which aluminum hydride (alane, ) replaced nanoaluminum incrementally as a fuel in a nanocomposite thermite based on CuO, , and . Pressure cell and burn tube experiments demonstrated enhancements in absolute pressure, pressurization rate, and burning velocity when micron-scale aluminum hydride was used as a minor fuel component in a nanoaluminum–copper-oxide thermite mixture. Peak pressurization rates were found when the aluminum hydride made up about 25% of the fuel by mole. Pressurization rates increase by a factor of about two with the addition of , whereas burn tube velocities increase by about 25%. The enhancement in pressurization rate appears to primarily be a result of the increased pressure associated with the decomposition in the nanocomposite thermite system and an enhancement in convective heat transfer. Similar experiments were conducted with micron-scale aluminum in place of the aluminum hydride, which resulted in a reduction of all the previously mentioned parameters with respect to the baseline nanoaluminum–copper-oxide thermite. The addition of any amount of alane to iron oxide based thermite resulted in a reduction in performance in pressure cell testing. The performance of based thermite was largely unaffected by alane until alane became the majority fuel component. These results have been found to correlate with changes in the combustion mechanism through equilibrium calculations.",30,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34967,"Deep-throttle static test results from an and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene hybrid rocket motor are presented. The nominal 800 N thrust level was turned down to less than 12 N while still maintaining stable and controlled combustion. This turndown was accomplished using a commercial off-the-shelf throttle valve and a solid rocket motor case adapted for hybrid rocket testing. During throttled motor tests, the pressure ratio across the injector grows from a nominal value of 2.0 to greater than 3.0. This feature contrasts with the observed behavior of liquid rockets, where the injector pressure ratio drops significantly during deep throttle. This characteristic likely supports the observed hybrid burn stability during deep throttle. Data comparisons with a physics-based, throttled, hybrid rocket burn model accurately match for combustor pressure, thrust, and propellant consumption. At throttle levels approaching 20% of nominal, the exiting the throttle valve is entirely in a vapor state. The vapor chokes the injector and eliminates feed system coupling. This two-phase effect is another likely reason for the unexpected combustion stability observed at very deep-throttle levels. The ability to throttle deeply opens the possibility that hybrid thrusters could be simultaneously deployed for both main spacecraft propulsion and reaction control.",30,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34753,"Remotely piloted aircraft typically use commercial internal combustion engines as their power sources. These engines are designed to run at sea level, but these aircraft are often pressed into service at higher altitudes where the performance characteristics deteriorate. The performance characteristics of a Brison two-stroke engine at altitude were investigated using a test facility that can measure these characteristics over a range of pressures and temperatures. With its stock carburetor tuned to sea-level standard conditions, the engine created 5.5 peak horsepower, and brake-specific fuel consumption ranged from . At an altitude of 10,000 ft, the peak horsepower decreased by 40%, whereas the off-peak horsepower decreased by more than 90%. Furthermore, the carburetor caused operation at high altitudes to be unreliable. Specifically, if the engine was tuned at sea-level standard, it would not operate above 10,000 ft. To increase reliability, a throttle body fuel injection system was installed on the engine. The fuel injection system matched the carburetor peak power at sea-level standard conditions while increasing the power at high-altitude operating conditions by as much as 90% at low rpm and 12% at high rpm. Brake-specific fuel consumption was decreased to a consistent 1.0 to across operating speeds of 3000 to 7000 rpm, thus enhancing the range for the aircraft. Finally, both reliability at high altitude and startup reliability were increased with the throttle body fuel injection system, whereas the need for tuning by the end user was eliminated.",30,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35031,"Previous work showed that particles of mechanically alloyed powders burn faster than aluminum. However, such powders were coarser than fine aluminum commonly used in energetic formulations. This work addresses preparation of mechanically alloyed powders in which both internal structures and particle size distributions are adjusted. Powders with 50–90 at.% Al were prepared and characterized. Milling protocol was optimized to prepare equiaxial, micron-scale particles. Ignition temperatures measured using an electrically heated filament were much lower than those of pure Al powders and are close to those of Mg. Powders were aerosolized and ignited in air; the maximum pressure was higher, rates of pressure rise were greater, and ignition delays were shorter for the mechanically alloyed powders than for pure Al with directly comparable particle size distributions. Individual particle combustion experiments used laser ignition and showed that the alloyed particles burn in two stages, with the first stage gradually disappearing with an increased Al concentration. The effect of particle size on its burn time for the prepared alloys is relatively well described by a law, where is varying in the range of 1.1–1.5 for different compositions.",30,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34833,"The aim of this work is to clarify some issues raised recently on the characterization of the water hammer, by presenting a numerical analysis on the multiphysics taking place. For this purpose, the commercial code CFD-ACE+ is used with the so-called full cavitation model, which takes into account the effect of absorption and desorption of a noncondensable gas. A comparison between two different compressibility models is conducted, making use of an inverse engineering technique, which allows the tracking of the medium speed of sound. Finally, a numerical reproduction of a valve opening is proposed, leading to a sudden acceleration of the fluid and consequent vaporization of the liquid. The numerical results confirm high sensitivity of the water hammer prediction regarding the amount of noncondensable gas present in the liquid.",30,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34857,"Combustion noise may become an important noise source for lean-burn gas turbine engines, and this noise is usually associated with highly unsteady flames. This work aims to compute the broadband combustion noise spectrum for a realistic aeroengine combustor and to compare with available measured noise data on a demonstrator aeroengine. A low-order linear network model is applied to a demonstrator engine combustor to obtain the transfer function that relates to unsteadiness in the rate of heat release, acoustic, entropic, and vortical fluctuations. A spectral model is used for the heat release rate fluctuation, which is the source of the noise. The mean flow of the aeroengine combustor required as input data to this spectral model is obtained from Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. The computed acoustic field for a low-to-medium power setting indicates that the models used in this study capture the main characteristics of the broadband spectral shape of combustion noise. Reasonable agreement with the measured spectral level is achieved.",30,1

Measurements of plasma flux, radio frequency power, propellant flow rate, and ion kinetic energy were used to determine the ionization cost of argon and krypton in the helicon discharge. Experimental data on ionization cost, ion fraction, exhaust plume expansion angle, thruster efficiency, and thrust are presented that characterize the VX-200 engine performance over a throttling range from 15 to 200 kW radio frequency power. A semiempirical model of the thruster efficiency as a function of specific impulse indicates an ion cyclotron heating efficiency of . Operation at a total radio frequency coupled power level of 200 kW yields a thruster efficiency of at a specific impulse of with argon propellant.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34783,"Steady-state strand burner and laboratory-scale static fire motor experiments were used to determine the relative performance and viability of an environmentally friendly solid propellant composed of only nanoaluminum and frozen water. The nominal size of the nanoaluminum particles was 80 nm. The particles were homogeneously mixed with water to form pastes or colloids and then frozen. The measured parameters include burning rates, slag accumulation, thrust, and pressure. A system scaling study was performed to examine the effect of the size of the small-scale motors. The equivalence ratio was fixed at 0.71 for the strand burner and the laboratory-scale motor experiments. The effect of pressure on the linear burning rate was also examined. For an equivalence ratio of 0.71, the mixture exhibited a linear burning rate of at a pressure of 10.7 MPa and a pressure exponent of 0.79. Three motors of internal diameters in the range of 1.91–7.62 cm were studied. Grain configuration, nozzle throat diameter, and igniter strength were varied. The propellants were successfully ignited and combusted in each laboratory-scale motor, generating thrust levels above 992 N in the 7.62-cm-diam motor with a center-perforated grain configuration (7.62 cm length) and an expansion ratio of 10. For the 7.62 cm motor, combustion efficiency was 69%, whereas the specific impulse efficiency was 64%.

22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34957,"The present work is concerned with the impact of bifurcations, i.e., extensions of the pylon inside the bypass duct, on fan tonal noise radiated by civil turbofan engines. The investigation is carried out on a typical configuration composed of a rotor–stator stage, a row of struts, and one upper and one lower bifurcation. It relies on steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculations for a thin streamtube at 60% rotor span. The comparison to the isolated fan stage is used to evidence the impact of the bifurcations and the struts. The strongly nonuniform mean flowfield created by the bifurcations downstream of the fan represents the main acoustic risk. As a first effect, tonal noise is generated by the rotor due to load fluctuations on the blades during the rotation. As a second effect, the rotor wakes impinging on two adjacent stator vanes feature different shapes according to the position of the vane relative to the bifurcations; as a consequence, different pressure fields are radiated by all the vanes. Instead of the discrete azimuthal mode spectrum typical of an isolated rotor–stator stage, as predicted by Tyler and Sofrin (“Axial Flow Compressor Noise Studies,” SAE Transactions, Vol. 70, 1962, pp. 309–332), a broad mode spectrum is obtained for the acoustic field with bifurcations. Clearly, cutoff design is jeopardized, with, as a consequence, a significant increase of the sound power level by 2–3 dB at the blade passing frequency (1xBPF) and its harmonics. In the inlet, the shocks formed on the blades do not propagate as the corresponding pressure patterns are cut off. However, one can observe that their position along the chord moves back and forth during one revolution, which is expected to influence the generation of multiple tones, should it occur.",30,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34852,"Flow evolution and heat transfer capability in the cooling system of liquid rocket engines heavily depend on propellant thermophysical properties. Coolant thermophysical property analysis and modeling is therefore important to study the possibility of relying on a regenerative cooling system, whose performance is crucial to determine feasibility and convenience of pump-fed liquid rocket cycles of the expander type. The aim of the present study is to compare the behavior of different liquid fuels for expander-cycle engines. They are light hydrocarbons, binary mixtures of them, and liquefied natural gas, which is a mixture made basically of methane and minor fractions of other light hydrocarbons and nitrogen. A parametric analysis is carried out by a validated numerical solver to compare temperature increase, pressure loss, and heat transfer evolution for the different fuels along the same straight tube and subjected to assigned heat fluxes. Results show that similar engine performance can be obtained by the different candidate expander-cycle fuels, but significant differences can be seen in the flow evolution through the cooling channels.",30,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34824,"The ignition overpressure wave generated during the pressure build-up of a solid-rocket motor is numerically investigated in this study. Numerical simulations are compared to the LP10 experiments, consisting of the horizontal firing of a scaled-down model for the Ariane 5 P230 booster. The present work aims at the prediction of the main characteristics of the ignition overpressure in the far field and the assessment of afterburning influence on both its formation mechanisms and its alteration by the jet plume. Two three-dimensional large-eddy simulations are performed, one considering inert flow and one modeling the afterburning. Infrared images of the plume are also computed with a dedicated radiation transfer solver. An overall good agreement with the experimental results is reported on amplitude and duration. Nevertheless, the reactive case is found to provide better results on amplitude and directivity. The signature is also better reproduced on the microphones near the jet centerline, and the emitted infrared intensity is well captured. Computations indicate that the formation of the shock wave is obtained by coalescence of compression waves emitted by the accelerating jet at early times. For the reactive case, computations show an increased interaction between the jet and the overpressure wave.",30,1

This work follows the last author’s experiments: An engine was tested with nitrous oxide and paraffin wax as propellants. Several of the tests have been used as references for numerical simulations. The following approximations have been made: steady-state conditions, eddy dissipation model with one-step reaction, gaseous injection of fuel and oxidizer, and no droplets entrainment (typical of a paraffin grain). First of all, a single geometry without a diaphragm has been analyzed with different turbulence models (, shear stress transport, , renormalization group). It has been shown that the model predicts a lower flame temperature and chamber pressure than the model. Then, five geometries have been studied to compare two different types of diaphragms (one hole and four holes) in two positions (24 and 33% of the total length) to a configuration without any mixer. The effect of the diaphragm is to increase the mixing of the chemical species participating in the combustion process. The use of the diaphragm causes a performance enhancement, as shown in the experimental study. There is a good agreement between computational fluid dynamics results and experimental data: The efficiency is overestimated by less than 5.5%. This work proves the capability of computational fluid dynamics to predict global hybrid rocket performance: It can be considered as a useful tool in the study of mixing devices.",30,1

The results show that electron Larmor motion and charge separation become significant in small-scale magnetospheres, and that the thrust of the magnetic sail is affected by the cross-sectional area of the charge-separated plasma cavity. Empirical formulas for the thrust are obtained by changing spacecraft design and solar wind parameters.

The final goal of this study is (even though qualitative to some extent) to establish a method capable of predicting the acoustic characteristics of the high-temperature and high-velocity jets issuing from a hypersonic engine. As the first step, a high-enthalpy wind-tunnel plant without anechoic treatment was used for the cold-air jet experiments, and the acoustic data obtained were compared with those obtained in a small anechoic chamber. It is shown that, while it is necessary to pay attention to some noted exceptions, the directivity patterns and spectral shapes agree well at a wide range of radiation angles by taking into account the correction of . The mean-flow measurements revealed that, due to the complicated geometry of the nozzle, the jet has a highly asymmetric velocity profile at the ramp end and that the development of the jet plume is also inclined and asymmetric, which resulted in the complicated patterns of the acoustic radiation.

In the present study, the authors conducted two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations on small-scale magnetospheres to investigate thrust characteristics of a magnetic sail and its derivative, magnetoplasma sail, in which the magnetosphere is inflated by an additional plasma injection. As a result, the authors found that the electron Larmor motion and the charge separation become significant on such a small-scale magnetosphere and the thrust of the magnetic sail is affected by the cross-sectional size of the charge-separated magnetosphere. The authors also reveal that the plasma injection, on the condition that the kinetic energy of plasma is smaller than the local magnetic field energy , can significantly inflate the magnetosphere by inducing diamagnetic current in the same direction as the onboard coil current. As a result, the magnetoplasma sail thrust is increased effectively by an additional plasma injection: the magnetoplasma sail thrust becomes up to 7.5 times larger than the original thrust of the magnetic sail . In addition, they found that the thrust gain of the magnetoplasma sail, defined as “magnetoplasma sail thrust/(magnetic sail injection thrust)” becomes up to 2.2.",30,1
