The objectives of the experiment were to measure flame stabilization and position under high-pressure conditions. Data were obtained at pressures from 2 to 16.5 MPa and mixture ratios from 2.9 to 20. High-speed cameras captured side-on chemiluminescence and infrared images of the flame. Results show that the flame-spreading angle from the injector ranges from approximately 3 to 6 deg, varying with pressure and propellant mass flow rate. A novel borescope was used to image the flame from upstream of the GOX post, enabling visualization of the flame near its stabilization location. The flame stabilization characteristics change significantly with the fuel flow velocity (which is proportional to pressure). At low pressures and fuel flow velocities, the flame appears to be distributed azimuthally in a nearly axisymmetric manner. At higher velocities, helical spirals of luminosity develop near the GOX post. In addition, the side-on views reveal concentrated streaks of, presumably, fuel entering the combustion chamber. These results suggest that computations must resolve the individual fuel injection orifices, to capture the flame stabilization.",35,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36916,"This study provides a comparison between an Eulerian and a Lagrangian approach for simulation of ice-crystal trajectories and impact in a generic turbofan compressor. The enginelike geometry consists of a one-and-a-half stage (stator–rotor–stator) compressor, in which the computed airflow is steady and inviscid. Both methods apply the same models to evaluate ice-crystal dynamics, mass and heat transfer, and phase change along ice-crystal trajectories. The impingement of the crystals on the blade surfaces is modeled assuming full deposition for comparison and validation purposes. Moreover, the effect of ice-crystal diameter and sphericity variations on impinging mass flux and particle melting ratio is briefly assessed. Then, a more realistic wall interaction model predicts rebound, shattering, or deposition as a function of impact parameters that is applied. When the full deposition model is activated, an excellent agreement is observed between the Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches for the impinging mass-flux profiles on each blade, while moderate differences appear for the melting curves. However, significant differences appear between both approaches when using the more realistic wall interaction model. The analysis of these results highlights the classic limitations of standard Eulerian and Lagrangian methods for this type of applications.",35,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36715,"This study proposes the laser-ignited micromotor (LIMO), which is a new propulsion system for CubeSats to overcome the problems associated with conventional chemical propellants. The solid propellant pellets are stacked and stored in the micromotor. This concept makes it possible to design the total impulse of the micromotor in a flexible manner at a low cost and in a short time, depending on microsatellite missions. In addition, a laser-ignition system is integrated with the micromotor to address the problems of ignition delay and the difficulty in cutting the high-current feed lines of the ignition system. Firing tests are conducted in a vacuum chamber using four types of micromotors with different characteristics; that is, each type has a different number of solid propellant pellets and a different ignition system. Total impulses of 184 and are achieved by the two types of LIMOs with 98 and 140 stored pellets, respectively, with a burning rate of . Ignition delay is improved from 0.37 to 0.04 s by using the laser-ignition system. In addition, an engineering model of the LIMO is designed.",35,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36912,"Higher efficiency and greater performance in gas-turbine engines can be achieved by increasing the combustion temperature but is limited by durability concerns for downstream hardware. Large-scale dilution cooling flows can be injected in the combustor to promote mixing and reduce incoming temperatures, but this generates spatial and temporal nonuniformities for the first row of turbine vanes. The lack of uniformity is exacerbated as combustor designs are reduced in length to reduce overall engine weight, but little is known about how the vane surface conditions are affected. This work computationally modeled the flow in a previously studied nonreacting combustor simulator, using both time-average (steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, RANS) and time-dependent (delayed detached-eddy simulation, DDES) analyses. The effect of several dilution hole configurations on the adiabatic wall temperature and heat transfer coefficient of the first vane were studied in the time-average approach. Configurations in which the dilution jets were closer to the vane resulted in some vane surface cooling but also significant flow nonuniformity at the turbine inlet, high vane temperature gradients, and increased heat flux to the vane. Heat transfer coefficient augmentation on the vane pressure side was more than three times higher than without upstream dilution, for dilution jets close to the vane. The time-dependent DDES analysis predicted a larger degree of mixing and more uniform vane temperatures, relative to the RANS analysis, but also indicated anisotropy of the turbulence entering the turbine, which cannot be correctly captured by a RANS approach. Refinement of the time-dependent analysis in a region around the dilution jets did not significantly change the turbine inlet flowfield and had only a minor impact on the predicted vane surface temperature. Overall, the results indicate that nonuniform flow in the combustor can significantly impact vane temperature but should be modeled using scale-resolving simulations for best accuracy.",35,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36794,"To investigate the potential performance benefits of tailored fuel injection in a scramjet engine, flow through a rectangular-to-elliptical shape-transitioning scramjet was simulated with two different combustor injection geometries: one with uniform film injection, and the other with oblique-angle cross-flow porthole injectors targeting the flow structures observed in engine simulations. Both engines used inlet injection to promote rapid ignition and burning of the combustor-injected fuel. The simulations were compared with experimental data for validation purposes. The tailored-injection engine fuelled to an equivalence ratio of 1.24 realized higher performance than the film-injection configuration, achieving oxygen-based mixing and combustion efficiencies of 98.9% and 84.9%, respectively. Tailored injection shows promise as a method for improving scramjet performance, allowing higher fuel efficiency with simplified fuel injection, and potentially shorter combustor sections.",35,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37192,"In this Paper a newly designed heaterless hollow cathode is studied for 10,000 ignition cycles. The current-voltage characteristics and upstream pressure of the hollow cathode are monitored during this procedure, and a destructive analysis is made after 10,000 ignition cycles. It is found that by using a high-voltage cold ignition approach and an arc discharge mode for heating the performance of this hollow cathode is stable. The anode voltage varies within 4 V during the test, and the downstream end of the emitter and that of the orificed cathode plate are chamfered slightly. The dominant reasons for the reduction of ignition erosion and for the stable performance of the device are analyzed",35,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36889,"A breadboard model (BBM) of an altering-intensity swirling-flow-type (A-SOFT) hybrid rocket engine was recently developed, and static firing experiments of the BBM were performed under various axial and tangential oxidizer mass-flow rates. A-SOFTs are intended to control thrust at an optimal oxidizer-to-fuel-mass ratio and achieve a high baseline of regression rates with a fixed motor configuration. This is possible by controlling both the oxidizer mass-flow rate and the effective geometric swirl number. A simple model based on a continuous and monotonic function of oxidizer mass flux and effective geometric swirl number was able to accurately predict the performance of experiments conducted on the A-SOFT BBM. The local fuel regression behavior in the axial direction of the A-SOFT BBM was shown to be like that of a swirling-oxidizer-flow-type hybrid rocket engine. Combustion efficiency was evaluated indirectly using equations for the efficiencies of thrust and specific impulse to eliminate errors due to local pressure shifts and the centrifugal force in swirling flows. In most cases, this indirect method compensated for the overestimations of efficiency that resulted by directly using chamber-pressure data.",35,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37074,"A liquid injection thrust vector control (LITVC) system was designed for a hybrid rocket that uses 95 wt % hydrogen peroxide, and the system was demonstrated by using the hydrogen peroxide as the injectant. The influence of the chamber pressure, injectant flow rate, and injection location on the LITVC performance was parametrically investigated. The investigations revealed that the chamber pressure had a significant influence on the LITVC performance. As the chamber pressure increased from 20 to 40 bar, the side specific impulse improved from 71.7 to 157.3 s under injectant flow rates equal to 9% of the primary gas flow rates and at the injection location of (where is the distance from the throat to the injection location and is the length of the nozzle diverging section). To examine the effects of injection location on the LITVC performance, side specific impulses were measured at , 0.47, and 0.72 under the chamber pressure condition of 40 bar. Among all injection locations, provided the highest side specific impulses under all injectant flow rate conditions. Furthermore, the radial spreading caused by increasing the injectant flow rates degraded the LITVC efficiency.",35,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36977,"Hybrid propellants are of great interest in space propulsion, but their use has been limited due to the low burning rate of their solid fuel. The use of paraffin was a breakthrough, but these grains exhibit excessive brittleness. Recently, it was proposed that the application of paraffin particles agglutinated by a polymer matrix eliminates these issues, but the high temperatures of the binder degradation still impose a limiting factor to the propulsive performance. In the present work, this challenge is overcome by employing a metallic complex as catalyst that selectively lowers the temperature of the polymer degradation, increasing the compatibility between binder and paraffin. For hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) degradation, Cu, Ni, Co, and Cr acetylacetonate complexes demonstrated catalytic effects in high temperatures, whereas copper acetylacetonate stood out in lower temperatures. Test fires allowed determining the regression rate by using the weight loss method and comparing with the data available in the literature, in which paraffin and HTPB grains set the highest and the lowest limits, respectively. The addition of paraffin particles to HTPB showed some enhancement, while the inclusion of the copper catalyst substantially improved the regression rate, suggesting this fuel grain as a promising alternative for hybrid rocket motors.",35,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37117,"Rotating detonation engines (RDEs) represent a promising technology for improving the performance of existing aerospace combustors, but additional research is needed to characterize the operability limits and performance of these devices. In particular, contact surface burning and preignition of propellants can have a profound impact on both performance and limit-cycle detonation behavior, but the detailed mechanisms behind this behavior and the associated scaling with chamber pressure are not well understood. To this end, ignition delay times are computed using a constant pressure–enthalpy, homogeneous reactor model and compared with typical RDE cycle times and operating conditions. Results are presented for combustion in both oxygen and air at various pressures using hydrogen, methane, and natural gas fuels. Results suggest that preignition of propellants before wave arrival may dominate chamber behavior and prevent stable limit-cycle detonation from occurring with certain propellant combinations above certain pressures. The impact of liquid injection is also considered with respect to changes in mixed gas temperature and vaporization delay. Finally, a simplified assessment of the injector dynamic response and turbulent mixing environments are considered in an effort to demonstrate the significance of ignition delay relative to these other mechanisms. These results support observed high-pressure RDE operating behavior in tests conducted at Purdue University, and they provide insight into potential operability limits and scaling of RDEs to high operating pressures.",35,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37044,"Experiments are performed to investigate the combustion features in a laboratory-scale hydrogen /air annular rotating detonation combustor under the off-design condition of low air mass flow rates. The air mass flow rate is ranged from 10 to 115 g/s, and the overall equivalence ratio is ranged from 0.6 to 1.0. The unstable longitudinal pulsed deflagration (ULPD), rotating fast deflagration (RFD), and stable longitudinal pulsed deflagration (SLPD) are found to exist in the combustor according to the analysis of pressure traces obtained at different circumferential and axial positions. The RFD is such a combustion instability coupled with the first tangential acoustic mode, but it occurs very rarely. The propagation speed of the RFD waves is approximately 500 m/s, and the pressure wave amplitudes are as low as 0.2 MPa. The SLPD appears with stronger and periodic pressure oscillations, and it is coupled with the first longitudinal acoustic mode of the combustor. The ULPD found in the present experiment can be regarded as the longitudinal mode even though the main frequency band is wider. The pressure oscillations are very irregular in the ULPD situation, but they are traveling forward and backward along the axial direction of the combustor. The variation of the air mass flow rate has more influence on the oscillation intensity of the deflagration wave than the variation of the equivalence ratio. It is also found that the pressure oscillations in the air and hydrogen plenums are forced by the unstable combustion process in the annular combustor. The unchoked condition of the injectors contributes the system coupling of the combustor and plenum.",35,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36740,"A simplified description of heat release oscillations associated with vortex-driven combustion instabilities is developed that can greatly reduce the amount of data required for determining the linear stability of combustor eigenmodes. The simplification is achieved by first representing heat release fluctuations as sinusoidal oscillations and then modeling the amplitude of the oscillations using a heuristic assumption of proportionality between the mean and the fluctuating components of local heat release. It is shown that by simply knowing 1) the average heat release, and 2) the heat release at any particular phase of the oscillations, complete spatiotemporal description of heat release oscillations can be reconstructed, and the linear stability of a given eigenmode can be determined. The description is shown to correctly determine the linear stability of a 150 Hz vortex-driven marginal amplitude instability in a laboratory-scale dump combustor with local and global Rayleigh indices within 16% of the experimentally obtained values. The approach opens up the possibility of predicting modal stability in the future without experiments, by using other forms of data, such as computational data on time-averaged heat release distribution and physics-based modeling data on phase-specific heat release rates.",35,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37034,"This paper reports experimental and numerical works devoted to the role of aluminum combustion on the stability of solid rocket motors. An experimental setup, known as the velocity-coupled T-burner, which provides measurements of the contribution of aluminum combustion to stability, has been developed and used. Experiments unambiguously show that aluminized propellants have a strong destabilizing contribution, whereas nonaluminized do not. This destabilizing behavior is found to depend much on aluminum agglomerate size distribution. In addition, two-phase numerical simulations are conducted on the setup and confirm experiments. It is found that the instability arises due to a thermoacoustic coupling between pressure waves and the heat release from aluminum combustion. Simulations also stress the role of aluminum agglomerate particle size as in experiments. This work experimentally and numerically proves that aluminum combustion represents a source of instability in solid rockets that should not be overlooked. This suggests that the widely accepted viewpoint that particle phase always damps pressure waves may not be always true for some aluminized propellants.",35,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37098,"The burning rates of solid propellants comprising different nanoaluminum powders and distilled water were examined at pressurized conditions up to . Several aluminum powders were tested using a strand burner technique: uncoated nanopowder (ALEX), stearic-acid coated nanopowder (L-ALEX), Viton-coated nanopowder (V-ALEX) with two different particle sizes, and bimodal mixture of V-ALEX and micrometer-size powders. Propellants containing ALEX, L-ALEX, and bimodal compositions followed the power law relation throughout the pressure range, with pressure exponents of , 0.5, and 0.28, respectively. Propellants containing V-ALEX powder demonstrated two different regimes: at pressures lower than 1.8 MPa, the burning rates were constant with respect to pressure; whereas for higher pressures, the burning rates followed the power law relation with and for powder diameters of 60 and 100 nm, respectively. The combustion efficiency, defined as the fraction of aluminum that oxidized during combustion, showed high values (90–95%) for all tested compositions.",35,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37075,"Hypergolic hybrid motors have the potential to improve the safety, reliability, and versatility of rocket systems. They may also serve as a viable replacement for highly toxic liquid fuels (for example, hydrazine, monomethyl hydrazine, etcetera) conventionally used in hypergolic systems. Ammonia borane (AB)-based fuels are relatively nontoxic hydrogen-dense solids that have good theoretical performance. AB has also been found to be highly hypergolic with white fuming nitric acid (WFNA), potentially enabling it to replace existing toxic hypergolic fuels. In this work, hypergolic ignition delay tests were performed on AB synthesized with a novel water-promoted scalable process to characterize its performance as a hypergolic fuel. Typical ignition delays with WFNA were found here to be approximately 2–10 ms. Ignition delay tests performed with AB powder sieved into different particle size ranges indicated a particle size dependency for the ignition delay, with the finer AB particles igniting after shorter delays. AB was successfully incorporated into Sylgard®-184, which is a silicone elastomer binder, and ignition delay tests were performed on high solids loading (80%) Sylgard-184-AB pellets. Mean ignition delays for the Sylgard-184-AB fuel pellets tested were less than 50 ms, which may make the formulation viable for use in hypergolic hybrid motors.",35,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37219,"A repetitively pulsed plasma was used to stabilize a lean premixed turbulent swirl flame under flow pulsations with amplitudes ranging between 10 and 30% of the total flow rate. Flow pulsations with a frequency of 5 Hz were generated by a high-amplitude flow disturbance system to simulate the surge conditions in real combustors. The discharge pulses were set with a tunable delay time relative to the flow pulsations. When the discharge pulses occur before or during the flow pulsation, the plasma extends the lean flammability limit of the swirl flame. The transient heat-release rate indicates that the flame stabilization is caused by a plasma reignition process. However, when the plasma discharges occur with specific time delays after the flow pulsation, the plasma further destabilizes the flame, which is attributed to wrinkled flame surfaces and shock waves generated by plasma aerodynamic actuation. Increasing the discharge frequency to 40 Hz further extends the ignition limits from 0.63 to 0.45 due to the increased average ignition energy. The paper may provide an alternative solution for direct control of unsteady combustion dynamics.",35,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37092,"A Mach 2 supersonic cavity flameholder is simulated using three hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)/large-eddy simulation (LES) turbulence modeling approaches. Finite rate chemistry is included with an ignition-delay-optimized three-step ethylene mechanism. The models investigated include the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) model, with both steady and unsteady (turbulent) inflow conditions, as well as the dynamic hybrid RANS–LES (DHRL) model with steady inflow conditions. Results are interrogated to determine the effect of combustion on the flowfield within the cavity. Results between the different models are also compared with one another and to experimental data to highlight key differences between them. It is found that both the IDDES model with unsteady inflow (UIDDES) and the DHRL model show significantly better predictive performance than the IDDES model with steady inflow. Analysis of turbulence production mechanisms for each of the models provides insight into the reasons for this behavior. Interestingly, the DHRL model is capable of mitigating well-known weaknesses of traditional hybrid models in the region of RANS-to-LES transition without requiring the use of a more complex unsteady inlet boundary condition prescription.",35,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37196,"Geometric throats are commonly applied to rocket combustors to increase pressure and specific impulse. This paper presents the results from thrust measurements of an ethylene/gas-oxygen rotating detonation engine with various throat geometries in a vacuum chamber to simulate varied backpressure conditions in a range of 1.1–104 kPa. For the throatless case, the detonation channel area was regarded to be equivalent the throat area, and three throat-contraction ratios were tested: 1, 2.5, and 8. Results revealed that combustor pressure was approximately proportional to equivalent throat mass flux for all test cases. Specific impulse was measured for a wide range of pressure ratios, defined as the ratio of the combustor pressure to the backpressure in the vacuum chamber. The rotating detonation engine could achieve almost the same level of optimum specific impulse for each backpressure, whether or not flow was squeezed by a geometric throat. In addition, heat-flux measurements using heat-resistant material are summarized. Temporally and spatially averaged heat flux in the engine were roughly proportional to channel mass flux. Heat-resistant material wall compatibility with two injector shapes of doublet and triplet injection is also discussed.",35,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37017,"A series of firing tests have been performed on a laboratory-scale hybrid rocket engine of 200 N class, fed with gaseous oxygen through a converging nozzle injector, to assess the mechanical feasibility and regression rate of a newly developed paraffin-based fuel. Such an injector configuration, by producing recirculation at the motor head hand, has been already demonstrated to influence the standard fuels regression rate, which yields an increase with the port diameter at given mass flux. In this study, paraffin-fuel regression rate dependence on the mass flux and grain port diameter in the form of a power function is determined to be similar to that established with polymeric fuels, despite the different mechanism of consumption that involves the fuel surface liquid-layer instability other than the vaporization typical of classical polymers. Comparison with some data in the literature is presented. Data retrieved from the testing campaign are compared with numerical results obtained by adopting a simple but efficient modeling strategy and a commercial solver. The numerical solution gives evidence of the recirculating flow at the injector exit, which is also responsible for the paraffin contamination observed in the motor prechamber. A good agreement is found with chamber pressure experimentally measured.",35,1
