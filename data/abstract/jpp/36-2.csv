The design of the thruster is described, along with the testing of the catalyst material. Thruster firings were completed at sea-level atmospheric conditions and in vacuum, with a vacuum specific impulse of 160 s and a characteristic velocity efficiency of greater than 95% achieved. The final thruster design demonstrated good overall performance, with initial lifetime testing suggesting that the catalyst offers good robustness. A case study suggests that the thruster would provide a level of performance comparable to that of a hydrazine-based propulsion system for a high-velocity-change, volume-constrained low-Earth-orbit spacecraft mission, but at lower cost.",36,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37346,"A numerical optimization of the torque generated by a vertical-axis wind turbine was completed using a double-multiple-streamtube momentum model. Aerodynamic force functions were obtained from curve fitting to experimental airfoil data. An optimal pitch function was found such that the torque output of the turbine was maximized. The numerical optimization procedure computes an optimal blade pitch trajectory based on the aerodynamic characteristics of a particular airfoil. This procedure was generalized in order to gain insight into the fundamental behavior regarding the relationship between the airfoil characteristics and turbine performance. The effect of the airfoil polars on the optimized turbine power output was studied and characterized. It was found that turbine performance depended only upon the drag polar rather than the individual lift and drag curves. Therefore, the effect of manipulating the drag polar was characterized by the resultant optimal power coefficient and corresponding tip-speed ratio at which this optimum was obtained for a low solidity turbine.",36,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37267,"The use of dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators to suppress traveling stall cells and thereby improve stall margin is examined. This involved the design and construction of a nonconductive high-solidity fan facility. The experiments were meant to support the application of similar systems in transonic axial compressors. Eight 63.5-mm-long plasma actuator segments were installed in the casing over the blade row at three axial locations that were indicated in the literature to be optimum for stall margin improvement. Independent control of fan revolutions per minute (RPM) and mass flow was used to set conditions that produced traveling stall cells. These were documented using an azimuthal array of microphones. The microphone pressure time series were spatially correlated to reveal the coherent wave packets. Different azimuthal combinations of the plasma actuators were investigated from a single actuator to all eight. A single actuator reduced the local spatial correlation metric (SCM), a measure of stall cell activity, by 40% and the azimuthally averaged SCM by 30%. A “memory effect” on the stall cell suppression was revealed, and it persisted for approximately 180° of the casing azimuth. The effect of the plasma actuator axial location was investigated at the design RPM and at two off-design RPMs. At the design RPM, the two most optimum locations were slightly upstream of the blade row and at the midchord of the blade row. This changed for the off-design conditions. For the range of the fan RPMs and actuator locations investigated, the stall margin improvements ranged from 1.63 to 5.45%. Finally, a plasma actuator stall extension model is presented for relating the required plasma actuator body force to the achieved stall margin improvement.",36,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37669,"An algebraic model to evaluate the structural behavior and the cyclic life of regeneratively cooled thrust chambers is presented. The model is based on the evaluation of the stresses, displacements, and elastoplastic strains induced by the severe thermomechanical environment under which the regeneratively cooled thrust chambers operate. The evaluation of the strain range accumulated during an engine duty cycle is then used to estimate the cyclic life by considering the so-called doghouse effect: that is, the peculiar deformation of the chamber inner wall that accumulates cycle after cycle. The cyclic life model is taken and rearranged from an already existing model. Both low-cycle fatigue and tensile ductile ruptures are considered as possible failure mechanisms. A minimum number of inputs are required for the application of the model: the geometry of the investigated section; the hot-gas and coolant pressures; and the wall temperature in the inner and outer walls. Of course, material characterization (mainly in terms of the stress–strain behavior and low cycle fatigue) must also be provided. After the model description and setup, a wide database of experimentally tested thrust chambers (which is almost unique in the technical and scientific literature) is reproduced for the sake of model verification.",36,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37380,"The ion-beam shepherd (IBS) space debris removal method requires two thrusters: one for impulse transfer (IT) and one for impulse compensation (IC). This paper proposes a novel thruster concept for the IBS-type missions where a single double-sided thruster (DST) simultaneously producing ion beams for the IT and IC purposes is used. The advantage of the DST design is that it requires approximately half the radio-frequency power compared with two single-ended thrusters, and it has a much simpler subsystem architecture, lower cost, and lower total mass. Such a DST thruster was designed, built, and tested. During the experimental campaign, a successful extraction of two ion beams from a single discharge chamber was achieved. The paper shows that it is possible to control the thrust magnitudes from the IT and IC thruster sides by altering screen/accel grid voltages, radio-frequency generator power, and mass flow rate. This is achieved by designing the IT and IC ion optics geometries to be different. It is demonstrated that the IC side can produce 30% more thrust compared with the IT side, proving that the DST concept is a viable alternative for the IBS-type space debris removal missions.",36,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37474,"This paper details the numerical investigations of bleed effects on supersonic inlet performance and buzz under various bleed conditions, including location, width, plenum static pressure, and inlet conditions (for example, inflow Mach number and throttling ratio). A bleed boundary condition model that reflects the effects of local flow expansion and porosity variation is proposed and validated. Flows around a supersonic inlet with bleeds are computed to show bleed effects on the inlet performance and buzz. By employing metamodeling in conjunction with a genetic algorithm, an optimal bleed condition maximizing the total pressure recovery is obtained, for each Mach number and throttling ratio, in the air chamber. A bleed condition that provides better performance for all Mach numbers and throttling ratios in the subcritical inlet operating range is then obtained by multipoint design optimization. Numerical results show that the optimal bleed condition, obtained by the multipoint design optimization, provides a much wider subcritical stable range for enhanced inlet operation by substantially increasing the total pressure recovery and suppressing inlet buzz.",36,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37202,"A new formulation of the axisymmetric flow equations in turbomachinery is proposed, which inherently contains the additional blade force equations for simulation of the (de)swirling effect of the blade rows. Unlike in explicit blade force models, the blade force term does not need to be separately solved throughout the time-marching integration of the flow equations. The new formulation does not have an equation for the swirl momentum, but it describes instead a strictly two-dimensional flow with specific convective flux and source terms. The convective fluxes include the slope of the mean blade surface (i.e., the blade angle), whereas a blade load source term replaces the explicit blade force with the surface camber. Suitable leading/trailing edge boundary conditions are developed to match the new equations in bladed subdomains of the meridional flowpath with the conventional equations in those unbladed. These conditions are coupled to a discontinuous flux difference splitting technique for treatment of a range of transonic regimes. The numerical solution has capabilities to capture choking and passage shocks, which are first addressed theoretically and then shown by re-obtaining two simple exact solutions. The validation goes through comparison to experimental results, a full three-dimensional solution, and explicit blade force solutions.",36,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37496,"This paper presents a study on the effect of a reduced electric field (E/N) on a premixed methane–air mixture oxidation at low temperature (less than 600 K). A coaxial reactor designed and built for the experiments has the flexibility to be configured for various discharge gaps and pressure conditions such that the discharge can be operated at various E/N. Volumetric dielectric barrier discharge plasma was established using 30 kV nanosecond pulses with repetition rates up to 3.5 kHz. A gas chromatographic technique was employed for product species characterization and quantification. The underscoring feature was the low-temperature ignition for 3 mm discharge gap cases, but no ignition was observed for 2 and 1 mm discharge gaps at atmospheric pressure. The effect of pressure on the low-temperature oxidation was also systematically examined. Discharge gaps of 3 and 2 mm followed a similar trend with pressure variation. Maximum combustion efficiency was observed for approximated E/N values close to 200 Td, whereas no conversion was observed after an E/N value of 350 Td for both discharge gaps. Electron energy branching calculations using BOLSIG+ and a plasma kinetics simulation using ZdPlaskin software were done to support the observations made during the experiments.",36,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37561,"An experimental study was conducted that explored the effects of oxidizers on solid fuel combustion characteristics. A counterflow diffusion flame experiment was used to explore the combustion characteristics of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene with nitrous oxide, gaseous oxygen, or heated air. Solid fuel regression rates were measured with all three oxidizers for comparison purposes. When using air as the oxidizer, the air was heated by an air gun to as high as 813 K to explore temperature effects. For a given flow rate, regression rates were highest for oxygen, followed by nitrous oxide and heated air, respectively. It was found that regression rate was more sensitive to oxidizer impingement velocity, and therefore strain rate, than to oxidizer temperature alone in the counterflow environment. Oxygen concentration in each oxidizer was shown to play a key role in the fuel regression rate. This is largely attributed to the oxidizer composition, which influences the measured fuel regression rate by affecting the stoichiometry, the adiabatic flame temperature, and location of the diffusion flame relative to the pyrolyzing fuel surface. High-speed imaging allowed for viewing of the burning surface and the location of the flame, which helped to provide further understanding of the combustion characteristics of the fuel with each oxidizer.",36,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37675,"In this study, an electrostatic thruster was newly developed, in which a diverging magnetic field with a cusp around a cathode was applied by using two solenoid coils. The effects of the magnetic field strength on thrust performance under a similar applied-magnetic-field configuration were investigated. Because of its light weight and lower price, argon was used as a propellant. By increasing the magnetic field strength, the thrust efficiency was improved owing to the suppression of the discharge current while an almost constant thrust was maintained. A specific impulse of 3800 s with thrust efficiency greater than 30% was obtained; the corresponding mass-averaged exhaust velocity exceeded the value by full-potential electrostatic acceleration of singly charged ions. From the thrust performance, ion beam current, and ion energy distribution function that were experimentally measured under the representative operation condition, 32% of the ion beam current and 43% of the total thrust were evaluated as the contribution of doubly charged ions.",36,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37661,"When a sphere of one reactant is placed in the medium of another reactant with which it is hypergolic, a chemical reaction (modeled here as a zeroth-order one-step irreversible Arrhenius reaction) occurs at the common interface of the two reactants, and the heat generated at the interface then is transmitted away from it by thermal conduction. Depending on the nature of the problem, the system may approach an explosive mode, or it may settle into a steady-state mode. The critical condition defining the transition between these two states is determined analytically. In particular, explicit formulas for the ignition delay time for the explosive mode are provided for two limits, one in which an appropriately defined Damköhler number is large and the other in which it is closer to the critical conditions. This is accomplished here by deriving and solving an integral equation for the time evolution of the interface temperature, employing activation-energy asymptotics.",36,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37537,"This paper reports on the effects of fuel and equivalence ratio on the response of lean premixed swirl flames to acoustic perturbations of the flow, at atmospheric pressure. The response is analyzed using flame transfer functions, which relate the relative heat release rate fluctuations from the flame to the relative velocity fluctuations of the incoming flow. Two fuels, propane and methane, and five equivalence ratios are considered. The 10 flames investigated are selected to exhibit the local maximum of the transfer function gain around the same frequency, 176 Hz. The results show that changing fuel and equivalence ratio influences both the gain and the phase of the transfer function. The changes observed at 176 Hz, where the dynamics of the flame is mainly controlled by the flame vortex roll-up mechanism, are discussed. Based on the analysis of the flowfields and the flame wrinkling, the laminar burning velocity and the flame temperature are identified as the main parameters controlling the gain. They have two competing effects: first, by enhancing the flame vortex roll-up and, second, by affecting the strength of the vortex generated by the acoustic forcing due to changes in the height of the flame stabilization location.",36,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37618,"The dynamic characteristic of an injector is important for improving engine characteristics and preventing instability. In this study, the experiments on the unstable flow of a closed-type swirl injector were conducted, and the dynamic characteristic analysis of the relationship between internal and external flows was discussed. Consequently, it was found that the unstable characteristics of internal and external flows were similar. Main geometric parameters affecting the injector self-excited instability were also investigated. The fluctuating amplitude was mainly related to the momentum of the flow. On the other hand, the instability frequency was related to the axial velocity inside the swirl injector. Experiments with external pulsation were carried out to investigate the effect of the instability frequency in real environments. It was observed that the mean breakup length reduced by 25%, and the fluctuation amplitude of the spray angle increased more than twice compared with the out of tuned case. The results of this study can be an inspiration to engine design, considering the dynamic characteristics of an injector.",36,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37614,"The present study deals with the evaluation of the propulsive performance of aluminum (Al)–water gelled composite propellant. Here, Al and water have been gelled using polyacrylamide as a gelling agent. Gelled propellants were tested in a motor of 60 mm in diameter with a cylindrical port burning configuration. The average combustion efficiency of 52.83% and an average of 46 s were obtained for a gelled propellant prepared with nonactivated aluminum (pyral); whereas in the case of gelled propellants prepared with mechanically activated aluminum, the corresponding values were 70% and 62.4 s, respectively, which were obtained for a convergent nozzle. If these values were extrapolated to a chamber pressure of 70 bar and with a convergent–divergent nozzle that was optimally expanded, the specific impulse obtained would be 165.3 s. The use of activated aluminum in gelled propellants increased the combustion efficiency by nearly 15%, and the corresponding average residue was reduced from 53 to 27%.",36,2
