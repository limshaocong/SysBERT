A conjugate heat flux removal finite element analysis simulation was developed with excellent accuracy for predicting heat flux amplification and the peak inside wall temperature in single-side heated flow channels. The simulation was expanded in this work by developing a conceptual model that identifies some of the parameters controlling the amplification. Although the model appears to be fluid- and flow regime-independent, more work is required. The model was used to develop amplification and correlation comparisons for a single-side heated monoblock with a circular flow channel. At a incident absorbed heat flux, the model predictions had excellent agreement with the simulation and prototype predictions. At this heat flux, for example, the model amplification prediction was 1.20; i.e., the inside flow channel maximum heat flux was 20% higher than the incident heat flux. The corresponding amplifications for the simulation and prototype were 1.22 and 1.20, respectively. Finally, the model was developed to be applicable in the region and had very good inside wall radial heat flux and temperature circumferential distribution predictions.",29,1

In sea level conditions, it forces the flow to a symmetrical separation, limiting the side load generation and increasing the thrust. After the transition, under high-altitude conditions, the nozzle flows full, increasing the vacuum thrust. A hot flow experimental study has been conducted at the DLR, German Aerospace Center on a planar dual bell nozzle. The wall temperature distribution has been measured at various depths for the determination of the heat flux through the wall. The region of the inflection is of particular interest for the adjustment of the conventional cooling methods of dual bell nozzles. The contour inflection leads to a local increase of the thermal loads. In addition to the tests, the flow behavior and thermal loads have been calculated with a computational fluid dynamics method and compared with the experiment.",29,1

The environment temperature changes greatly from the curing to the firing conditions of the missile. The propellant grains inside the missile experiences similar temperature variations as well. In this study, the time–temperature shift principle, cumulative damage theory, and finite element software are used to evaluate the time–temperature-dependent behavior of the structural integrity of the solid-propellant grains under cooling loads. The results show that the cooling load from the curing temperature to the storage temperature significantly influences the safety factor of the propellant grains; the larger the cooling rate, the smaller the safety factor. Thus, safety factors of the propellant grains can be tuned to a desired value within certain limits by adjusting the cooling load with a smaller cooling rate.",29,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34533,"Coolant flow modeling in regeneratively cooled rocket engines fed with turbo machinery is a challenging task because of the high wall temperature gradient, the high Reynolds number, the high aspect ratio of the channel cross section, and the heat transfer coupling with the hot-gas flow and the solid material. In this study the effect of wall heat conduction on the coolant flow is analyzed by means of coupled computations between a validated Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations solver for the coolant flowfield and a Fourier’s equation solver for the thermal conduction in the solid material. Computations of supercritical-hydrogen flow in a straight channel with and without coupling with the solid material are performed and compared to understand the role played by the coupling on the coolant flow evolution. Finally, the whole cooling circuit of the space shuttle main engine main combustion chamber is analyzed in detail and discussed for the sake of comparison of results obtained with the present coupled procedure with available literature data.",29,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34534,"It is well known that the solid tab technique is effective in enhancing mixing in jet flow, but its protrusion nature will also incur thrust loss. Previous experimental results on the so-called air tab technique have revealed that the air tab can achieve a level of mixing enhancement similar to the solid tab, although it will not introduce any thrust loss. The present numerical investigation aims to study, in detail, the evolution and generation of the streamwise vortices by the air tab under both subsonic and supersonic conditions. For the air tab case, the injected air stream will be bent and twisted by the greater momentum of the primary jet and bifurcate subsequently into two streams. Each stream corresponds to one half of the counter-rotating streamwise vortices pair. The two sources that are responsible for the generation of the streamwise vortices in the solid tab can also be found in the air tab case.",29,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34642,"An experimental investigation has been carried out to study the mixing-promoting efficiency of triangular tabs with sharp and truncated vertices. The mixing promotion caused by two identical triangular tabs, with sharp and truncated vertices, offering a geometrical blockage of 2.5% each, placed at the exit of a Mach 2 circular nozzle, was studied in the presence of adverse and marginally favorable pressure gradients. The pressure decay along the jet centerline and the pressure profiles along and normal to the tabs were measured. The waves present in the core of the uncontrolled and controlled jets were visualized with the shadowgraph technique. The nozzle-pressure ratio was varied from 4 to 8, in the step of one, covering overexpansion and marginally underexpansion levels at the nozzle exit. The results of the present study demonstrate the validity of the hypothesis that the triangular tabs shedding vortices of continuously varying sizes is a better mixing promoter than the rectangular tabs, of identical blockage, shedding vortices of uniform size. Furthermore, the truncated triangular tab is found to be a better mixing promoter than the triangular tab of sharp vertex. As high as 87% reduction in core length was achieved with truncated triangular tabs at nozzle-pressure ratio 8. The corresponding core-length reduction caused by triangular tabs with a sharp vertex and rectangular tabs are 83 and 25%, respectively.",29,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34532,"Experimental and numerical studies are conducted on supersonic mixing of air injected from struts of various trailing ramp angles with freestream air at Mach number 1.63. By providing an alternate trailing ramp on the strut, streamwise vortices in spanwise row configuration are generated. In the present study, various alternate trailing ramp struts were examined and their capability to enhance supersonic mixing was evaluated. Numerical simulation of the flow field with struts of various trailing ramp angles such as 2.86, 5.71, 8.53, 11.31, 14.04, 18.43, and 26.57 deg is also carried out. From the numerical results, it is seen that mixing enhancement is better only for the strut with a 14.04 deg ramp angle compared with a plain strut. Three types of struts are considered for the current experimental investigation: plain strut, two relieved ramp struts 2RRS-14.04 deg, and three relieved ramp struts 3RRS-14.04 deg. Diagnostic methods employed are Mie scattering combined with image processing, time-averaged schlieren and time-resolved high-speed shadowgraph images, velocity measurement using laser Doppler velocimetry, and total pressure loss measurements. Numerical simulation of the flowfield is performed using the commercially available software Fluent.",29,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34634,"This paper addresses the combustion behavior of a monomethyl hydrazine droplet gelled with both hydroxypropyl cellulose and fumed silica in an environment of gaseous nitrogen dioxide. All of the monomethyl hydrazine/hydroxypropyl cellulose gel droplets displayed swelling and jetting that are typical for hydrocarbon gels with an organic gelling agent. Burning rates were measured for droplet diameters from 1.8 to 3.2 mm at two ambient pressures of 1.72 and 2.89 bar. It was found that the droplet burning rate is dependent on the droplet diameter similar to liquid monomethyl hydrazine. Over the investigated pressure range no dependence of the burning rate on pressure was found. The combustion of monomethyl hydrazine/hydroxypropyl gel was compared to monomethyl hydrazine/tetraglyme to examine the difference between a highly viscous surface layer (tetraglyme) and a fairly rigid surface layer (hydroxypropyl). Droplets of monomethyl hydrazine and tetraglyme showed increasing swelling frequencies and volume fluctuations during combustion, whereas the monomethyl hydrazine/hydroxypropyl droplets exhibited a more constant burning history. The monomethyl hydrazine/silica gels showed a different combustion mechanism with the formation of a rigid silica structure, microexplosions, and up to a 50% reduction in droplet volume during combustion.",29,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34668,"Erosive effects in polybutadiene-acrylonitrile- and hydroxyl-terminated-polybutadiene-based composite propellants are investigated using a planar geometry combustor. Head, mid, and aft-end motor pressure were measured as well as aft burning rate via the use of an ultrasonic transducer. The ultrasonic sensor performed very well, providing burning-rate histories that, when integrated, closely matched the measured web distance. The measurement revealed local unsteady behavior in some circumstances as well as a very high dynamic regression at ignition. From theoretical considerations, burning rate was shown to be a linear combination of base, erosive, and dynamic burning rate. The dynamic portion was removed, and erosive burning was studied using the classical Lenoir–Robillard model. Parameter estimates were made by fitting to an inferred burning rate based upon pressure measurements and confirmed by matching to ballistic reconstructions. The experiment covers mean chamber conditions ranging from 311 psi (2.14 MPa) to 641 psi (4.42 MPa) and port Mach numbers from 0.14 to 0.78. Data and reconstructions from five tests are included and indicate that the Lenoir–Robillard model is sufficient for estimating erosive burning. No significant differences were observed with regard to erosive burning for the polybutadiene acrylonitrile and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene propellants studied herein.",29,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34507,"An experimental investigation is conducted to determine the collision of droplets for an aluminized composite propellant using an innovative apparatus at various impact velocities. Droplets before and after collision are collected by means of quench-bomb technique. The morphology, composition, and size of the collected particles are analyzed with the aid of a scanning electron microscope, an X-ray powder diffraction, and a Malvern Mastersizer 2000. It is found that collected particles of various sizes are all spherical with diameters from 0.03 to . Collected particles mainly contain and Al. In addition, collision/coalescence of smaller droplets with larger droplets occurs dominantly in the converging nozzle. For the relative velocities of collision ranging from 3.8 to , the mean particle diameters and decrease after collision. The higher the relative velocity of the collision is and the larger the droplet diameter is before collision, the fiercer the fragmentation will be. Furthermore, collision causes fragmentation of droplets with diameter larger than as well as a significant reduction in volume fraction. Collision causes little volume fraction changes for droplets with diameter of but results in large volume fraction increases for droplets with diameter smaller than .",29,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34551,"To improve the atomization quality of gelled propellants, a chamber similar to a Helmholtz resonator was installed in an impinging jet injector to introduce disturbances on the atomized fluid. The spray formation of gelled propellant from impinging jet injectors with a Helmholtz resonator-like chamber was examined experimentally. A high-speed camera was used to record the detailed information of the liquid sheet breakup process. Installing a resonator chamber in the impinging jet injector always tends to decrease the breakup length of the liquid sheet, but rarely does the installation influence the flow rate of the injector. The breakup length of liquid sheet is minimal when the diameter ratio of chamber to exit equals 4. To obtain a shorter breakup length, the ratio of chamber inlet diameter to outlet diameter should be close to the value of 1, but cannot equal 1 because the mass flow rate is decreased when this ratio equals 1. The effect of the ratio of length to diameter of the chamber is minor. Although the breakup length is minimal, when the ratio of chamber length to diameter is between the value of 1 and 1.5, the mass flow rate is also decreased.",29,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34580,"The flame behavior, thermal structure, and combustion product concentrations of the flames of nonpulsating and pulsating plane jets were examined and compared. A nonpulsating plane jet was modified into a pulsating plane jet by introducing the jet fluids through a jet-impingement fluidic oscillator. The flame behavior was analyzed by photographing the flame from the lateral direction and focusing on the near burner region. The flame length was taken from long-exposure photographs. The temperature and combustion product concentrations were measured by using a fine-wire thermocouple and a gas analyzer, respectively. The results showed that the pulsating jet flame is significantly shorter and wider than the nonpulsating jet flame. A difference in the flame length larger than 30% was typical. The central region temperature distributions of the pulsating jet flame presented wide plateaus of high temperatures. The maximum temperature that the pulsating jet flame may attain was higher than that of the nonpulsating jet flame by about 250°C. The pulsating jet flame presented significantly larger concentration, smaller CO concentration, and smaller unburned than those of the nonpulsating jet flame, which implied that the combustion happening in the pulsating jet is more complete than that happening in the nonpulsating jet.",29,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34584,"Potential dual-mode monopropellant/electrospray-capable mixtures of hydroxylammonium nitrate with ionic liquid fuels [Bmim][] and [Emim][] are synthesized and tested for catalytic decomposition in a microreactor setup. The setup is benchmarked using a 30% hydrogen peroxide solution decomposed via silver catalyst. Results show similar trends but with variance in the quantitative data obtained in the literature. This was found to be a direct result of the sample-holder geometry. Hydrazine decomposition was conducted on an unsupported iridium catalyst. The same trends in terms of pressure-rise rate during decomposition are obtained with unsupported catalyst but at 100 °C instead of room temperature for tests conducted on supported catalysts in the literature. For the [Bmim][]/hydroxylammonium nitrate propellant, rhenium catalyst preheated to 160 °C yielded a pressure-rise rate of , compared to for iridium catalyst and for no catalyst at the same temperature. [Emim][]/hydroxylammonium nitrate propellant shows slightly less activity at 160 °C preheat temperature, yielding a pressure-rise rate of 20, 4, and for injection onto rhenium, iridium, and the thermal plate, respectively. Final results indicate that desirable ignition performance may potentially be obtained by using a supported rhenium catalyst.",29,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34610,"Unsteady Navier–Stokes simulations are used to study the static and dynamic discharge characteristics of shear-thinning fluids passing through plain-orifice atomizers fed by a crossflow. The crossflow velocity is varied to assess implications of feeding fluid in a multi-element injector fed from a common manifold. Large and distinct horseshoe vortices are periodically generated near the inlet lip and convected along the length of the orifice passage. As these and other vortical structures pass through the orifice exit plane, they create small and distinct mass-flow pulsations. These pulsations are characterized for a variety of orifice length-to-diameter ratios, Reynolds numbers, manifold crossflow velocities, and fluid rheologies. Using candidate gels as testing fluids, it is typically observed under the unsteady flow conditions that discharge coefficient ranges from 0.5 to 0.6, Strouhal numbers are around 0.3, and oscillation magnitudes are less than 5% of averaged discharge coefficient.",29,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34198,"This paper presents results of a multiphase computational fluid dynamics code using a coupled level-set/volume-of-fluid method to simulate liquid atomization. This interface-capturing approach combines the mass conservation properties of the volume-of-fluid method with the accurate surface reconstruction properties of the level-set method, and it includes surface tension as a volume force calculated with second-order accuracy. Developed by one of the authors, the multiphase code builds upon the combined level-set/volume-of-fluid methodology to enable bubbly flow, liquid breakup, and phase-change simulations. The extension presented in this paper couples a Lagrangian dispersed phase model for postbreakup tracking of droplets with block-structured adaptive mesh refinement on the Eulerian grid. Under an appropriate set of criteria, the transfer of droplets representation from the Eulerian to the Lagrangian discretization enables the simulation of sprays on larger domains and for longer physical times without degrading the overall accuracy of the calculation. A demonstration for like-on-like jet impingement of relevance to cold startup of liquid rocket engines is presented here at low, moderate, and high injection velocities, including validation with experimental data.",29,1

Recorded thoriated-tungsten temperature measurements adhere to the same trends observed in previous optical pyrometric studies with temperatures ranging from 2300–2500 K at the cathode tip, a peak temperature between 2500–2800 K some short distance upstream, and a corresponding minimum temperature of 2150 K at a location nearly 20 mm from the tip. The cathode axial temperature profiles were compared against those of pure tungsten to illustrate the large temperature-reducing effect lowered work function imposes by increasing thermionic electron emission from the cathode surface. In addition, the surface microstructure and elemental composition of the cathodes were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Multiple runs varying in length and current intensity on thoriated-tungsten cathodes revealed typical pathways of thorium migration as well as changes in surface composition.",29,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34525,"A model of system mass and life-cycle costs is used to determine the optimal number of thrusters for electric propulsion systems. The model is generalized for application with most electric propulsion systems and then applied to high-power Hall thruster systems in particular. Mass and cost models were constructed for individual thruster strings using as inputs the number of active thrusters, the number of redundant thrusters, and the total system power. Mass and cost are related through the launch cost of the propulsion-system mass, which unifies the optimization to a single global parameter based on cost. Fault-tolerance and string cost are driving factors determining the optimum thruster size for a given system-power level. After considering factors such as fault-tolerance, cost uncertainty, complexity, ground-test-vacuum-facility limitations, previously demonstrated power capabilities, and possible technology limitations, the development of two thrusters to flight status is suggested: a low-power model operating at 20–50 kW per thruster to support missions up to 500 kW system power and the development of a high-power model operating at 50–100 kW per thruster to support missions up to 1 MW system power.",29,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34330,"The electric solar wind sail is a propulsion system that uses long centrifugally spanned and electrically charged tethers to extract the solar wind momentum for spacecraft thrust. The sail angle with respect to the sun direction can be controlled by modulating the voltage of each tether separately to produce net torque for attitude control and thrust vectoring. A solution for the voltage modulation that maintains any realistic sail angle under constant solar wind is obtained. Together with the adiabatic invariance of the angular momentum, the tether spin rate and coning angle are solved as functions of temporal changes in the solar wind dynamic pressure, the tether length, or the sail angle. The obtained modulation also gives an estimate for the fraction of sail performance (electron gun power) to be reserved for sail control. We also show that orbiting around the sun with a fixed sail angle leads to a gradual increase (decrease) in the sail spin rate when spiraling outward (inward). This effect arises from the fact that the modulation of the electric sail force can only partially cancel the Coriolis effect, and the remaining component lays in the spin plane having a cumulative effect on the spin rate.",29,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34335,"A methodology is presented to analyze the potential benefits of magnetohydrodynamic energy bypass of a turbojet. The methodology is demonstrated with an analysis of a hypothetical high-flight-Mach-number air-breathing engine. The annular magnetohydrodynamic generator and accelerator ducts that are analyzed rely on nonequilibrium ionization to assess their major design parameters. The analysis is conducted with the one-dimensional, axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic equations, which are numerically integrated to determine performance characteristics. The cycle analysis is conducted iteratively with the components of the engine, which include a spike inlet, magnetohydrodynamic generator, standard Brayton cycle turbojet (compressor, combustor, and turbine), and magnetohydrodynamic accelerator. The Mach 7, 30-km-alt flight condition yields an estimated specific thrust of at an aggressive 2200 K combustor temperature, where the break-even specific thrust point is at a combustor temperature of 2000 K. The predicted magnetohydrodynamic devices are 3 m in length with 5 T magnetic fields and conductivities of 1 to . The calculated isentropic efficiencies are 84% for the generator and 81% for the accelerator with 63% enthalpy bypass. Based on this analysis, areas of future research are highlighted that are vital for successfully implementing the proposed magnetohydrodynamic turbojet.",29,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34600,"This study characterizes the central recirculation zones formed under combustion conditions, with natural gas as fuel with different geometries and degrees of premixing using a swirl combustor firing into a confinement representative of gas turbine combustors. Phase-locked particle image velocimetry is used as the main method of characterization. The technique enables characterization of the time-dependent behavior of the central recirculation zone and a three-dimensional reconstruction of its boundaries. The central recirculation zone typically had an asymmetric lobed shape and precessed about the central axis. Partially premixed combustion at near-stoichiometric equivalence ratios reduced the coherence of the central recirculation zone and often caused it to nearly disappear, although a small remnant of recirculation could still be found in the three-dimensional space. Lower equivalence ratios strengthened the central recirculation zone considerably, for both non-premixed and partially premixed combustion. Although the central recirculation zone was asymmetric in shape and precessed about the central axis, the precessing vortex core, commonly found in these flows, was found to be significantly suppressed especially when central fuel injectors were used. Its occurrence then became intermittent and irregular. A quarl exit nozzle with a divergent lip was found to reduce flame attachment to the fuel injector.",29,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34513,"The regression rate of the solid fuel is a primary parameter in the performance analysis for a hybrid rocket. Many studies in the past few years have theoretically claimed, or experimentally shown, a dependence of the regression rate on the chamber total pressure. Such behavior is generally traced back to the presence of oxygen below the flame zone and of heterogeneous reactions occurring at the surface and affecting the pyrolysis law. An experimental program was performed at the Space Propulsion Laboratory of the Politecnico di Milano showing, within the explored operating conditions and the associated uncertainty bands, a neutral trend for the solid fuel regression rate with increasing pressure. The formulation tested was hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene in gaseous oxygen at pressures ranging from 4 to 16 bar. A simplified analytical model, which retains the essential physics and accounts for pressure dependency, has been developed, together with the corresponding numerical simulation. The results of the proposed model are presented here. The experimental results are input to the developed model, to obtain a semi-empirical pyrolysis rate law that helps to describe a possible pressure dependency.",29,1

The measurement procedure is discussed in detail. Emphasis is given to accuracy in measurements, ease of operation, minimization of manpower, and savings of cost and time. With this in view, new adaptations in specimen preparation, test procedure, and data processing are incorporated. Burning rates of more than 300 batches of aluminized ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene composite propellant of three different compositions were measured. The results showed that the standard deviation in the measurements for a propellant batch was less than 1%. It was also demonstrated that the performance of full-size solid motors can be predicted with good accuracy by these burning rates with a small augmentation factor.",29,1

Fast solution times are achieved via vortex merging, limiting the number of calculations necessary at each time step, while solution integrity is maintained through the use of second-order time stepping, vortex-blob rediscretization, and the use of a “vortex curtain” preventing vortex mergers within a predetermined distance from the rotor. Finite span and spoke drag corrections are applied to account for three-dimensional effects in addition to a formulation for extending the two-dimensional model to arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. The two-dimensional free vortex model is validated against unswept and swept-bladed vertical axis wind turbine experimental data, with allowances for the effects of wind-tunnel walls made within the free vortex model in the case of the swept-bladed data set.",29,1
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34431,"This paper presents a procedure to determine the optimal terminal shock position for a ramjet engine, balancing the conflicting requirements of high total pressure recovery and guaranteed stability in the face of disturbances. We classify and quantify the disturbances, both external and internal, that may affect the shock position in supercritical operation. This includes disturbances in the freestream and those due to flow and thermal processes in the combustion chamber. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to establish the effect of these bidirectional (from upstream and downstream) disturbances on the terminal shock position in the intake. The tip-to-tail ramjet engine model required for this purpose is sourced from the authors’ recent work. The analysis makes it possible to determine a shock position margin (supercritical margin) that simultaneously induces good engine performance and stable operation at a level of guaranteed probability.",29,1
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34577,"The premixed combustion of natural gas and hydrogen at atmospheric pressure is investigated over a wide range of equivalence ratios and different degrees of steam and nitrogen dilution of up to 30% in the air. Emission formation, local temperatures, OH radical concentrations, and flame shape and position are measured in gas-fired tests. The measurement results confirm that steam effectively inhibits the formation of emissions, even at constant flame temperature. For both natural gas and hydrogen, and CO emissions below 10 ppm were measured up to near-stoichiometric fuel concentrations at wet conditions. Nitrogen dilution does not lead to reduced emissions. A numerical analysis conducted with a reactor network shows that the influence of steam dilution on radical concentrations and formation depends strongly on the degree of humidity and on the equivalence ratio. The thermal, the , and the NNH pathway are significantly constrained at wet conditions mainly due to reduced O atom concentrations, whereas prompt can be increased due to higher CH radical concentrations for the natural gas flame. Thus, the inhibiting effect of steam dilution on formation is stronger at high flame temperatures.",29,1
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34486,"The behavior of a ram-scram transition was examined using a direct-connect model scramjet experiment along with pressure measurements and high-speed laser interferometry. The work quantifies the sudden change in the wall static pressure profile and flame position that occurs as the downstream boundary condition abruptly changes when the flow becomes unchoked. Transition was studied in three ways; as a quasi-steady phenomenon due to slow decreases in fuel flow rate, or as caused by rapid variations in either fuel flow rate or test-section wall temperature. A regime diagram was constructed that plots the measured ram-scram transition boundary. Under certain conditions some periodic low-frequency oscillations of the flame position occur and they are shown to be correlated with oscillations of the upstream precombustion pseudoshock. A self-sustaining shear-layer instability, associated with the flameholding cavity, is believed to be the mechanism causing this behavior. The relevant time scales associated with the ram-scram transition and the flame-shock interactions are discussed.",29,1
