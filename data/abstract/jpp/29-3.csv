The environment in a sub-low Earth orbit (altitude of 140–200 km) was simulated by a laser detonation beam source, which has been previously used in studies on atomic oxygen-induced material degradation. The basic properties of the air breathing ion engine were studied using a hyperthermal beam. It is suggested that the hyperthermal molecules thermalized by scattering at the reflector surface in the air breathing ion engine. The efficiency of the collimator was experimentally investigated and the collimator was found to maintain the pressure inside the air breathing ion engine. An ion beam current of 16 mA at an acceleration voltage of 200 V provided a thrust of 0.13 mN for both hyperthermal and atomic oxygen beams. The maximum ion beam current was found to be limited by the space-charge effect. The experimental results strongly indicated the recombination of atomic oxygen into molecules inside the air breathing ion engine.",29,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34587,"The gasdynamic mirror is a magnetic confinement device that has been proposed as a concept that could form the basis of a spacecraft propulsion system by accelerating its ionized propellant without the endurance limitations imposed by electrodes. The geometry of the gasdynamic mirror is that of a simple magnetic mirror, with a stronger magnetic field at the ends, called mirrors, than at the center, producing a turning force that helps confine the plasma ions long enough for heating before being ejected through one of the mirrors, which serves as a magnetic nozzle. The main focus of this paper is to describe an experimental gasdynamic mirror device driven by a 2.45 GHz microwave source and present the results from the experiments. Argon was chosen as the propellant, and ionization comes from electron cyclotron resonance heating. Langmuir probe measurements provide two-dimensional maps of the plasma density and temperature inside the device. A maximum ion density exceeding and an electron temperature between 4 and 5 eV were found in the central section of the device. The ion density profile showed a local concentration at the exit mirror due to the magnetic field gradient in that region, and the plasma potential results hinted at the presence of an acceleration zone in the vicinity of the exit mirror.",29,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34574,"There is interest in the use of a helicon plasma source in propulsive applications as both an ion source and a thruster. Development of a helicon thruster requires a performance baseline as a basis for future optimization and modification. For the first time, the thrust of a helicon plasma source is measured using a null-type inverted pendulum thrust stand at an operating pressure of through the operating range of 215–840 W RF power, 11.9 and 13.56 MHz RF frequency, 150–450 G magnetic field strength, and propellant flow rate for argon. Maximum thrust is found to be 6.3 mN at a specific impulse of 140 s and a maximum specific impulse of 380 s at 5.6 mN. Thrust efficiency is less than 1.4% and demonstrates very-low-power coupling to ion acceleration.",29,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34702,"The effects of anode temperature on the performance of a 4.5 kW Hall-effect thruster are investigated. The approach separates the location of gas injection from discharge current collection using an anode band, which removes the main mechanism that heats the gas distributor. A thermal model predicts a 270 K reduction of the gas distributor temperature, which corresponds to a 28% increase in the propellant residence time. Collection of the discharge current on the anode band, which is upstream of the bulk Hall current region, generates a 10% increase in ion current density at the thruster centerline for discharge voltages of 100, 125, and 150 V at a xenon mass flow rate of . The initial reduction in neutral velocity with the anode band is counteracted by the influence of the channel wall temperature, which increases the neutral velocity of the particles by up to 25% greater than the velocity at the gas distributor exit plane. This reduces the potential thruster efficiency improvement from 5.5 to 2.5%. The selected downstream location of the anode band results in a 6–10% increase in discharge current compared with current collection on the gas distributor.",29,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34825,"The expansion of neutral gas in an open-ended cylindrical chamber into a large vacuum facility is investigated to understand neutral particle density distribution. The cylindrical chamber geometry with a single on-axis gas injection port is representative of a helicon plasma source discharge chamber. The neutral gas pressure profile along the cylinder wall is experimentally measured for argon and xenon mass flow rates of 0–200 sccm, at facility pressures up to and and torr Xe, respectively. The average relative error between the experimentally measured pressure profiles and the numerical results obtained with a direct simulation Monte Carlo code is less than 10%, with the maximum relative error below 30%. The single on-axis injection port into the cylindrical discharge chamber results in a nonuniform neutral particle density distribution in the source due to the recirculation zone generated in the rear of the discharge chamber. This highlights the potential impact of the propellant injection system design on the neutral particle depletion phenomenon in helicon plasma sources.",29,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34813,"Ablative materials are commonly used to protect the nozzle metallic housing and to provide the internal contour to expand the exhaust gases in both solid and hybrid rockets. Because of interaction with hot gas, these materials are chemically eroded during rocket firing, with a resulting nominal performance reduction. The objective of the present work is to study the erosion behavior of graphite nozzles in hybrid engines at different operating conditions and compare results with those obtained for solid motors. A main distinctive feature of hybrid engine operating conditions is, in fact, a greater concentration of oxygen-containing combustion products than solid motors. The adopted approach relies on a validated full Navier–Stokes flow solver coupled with a thermochemical ablation model that takes into account heterogeneous chemical reactions at the nozzle surface, rate of diffusion of the species through the boundary layer, ablation species injection in the boundary layer, heat conduction inside the nozzle material, and variable multispecies thermophysical properties. The parametric analysis performed in this study allows one to assess the impact of various parameters that affect the nozzle erosion rate, taking into account various combinations of fuels and oxidizers operating at different conditions.",29,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34671,"In this work, single-port, cylindrical grain laboratory-scale hybrid rocket motors are numerically simulated to study the effect of diaphragms. The effect of single and multiple diaphragms is investigated by varying diaphragm height, its axial location (for a single diaphragm), and spacing (for multiple diaphragms) at selected inlet . A single diaphragm increases the local regression rate and its influence is prominent only in the region immediate downstream. Therefore, a tangible increment in average regression rate with a single diaphragm can only be realized for motors with small . The combustion efficiency in the presence of a single diaphragm may increase or decrease relative to the case with no diaphragm depending on the height and the position of the diaphragm. A diaphragm positioned near the nozzle end of the motor is most effective in increasing combustion efficiency. For long motors , use of multiple diaphragms are required to increase the regression rate and combustion efficiency. This requires diaphragms to be strategically spaced. Simulations show that regression rate and combustion efficiency improvements are maximum when diaphragms are spaced 8–10 times their height. The results also show that, at optimal spacing, a few tall diaphragms are more effective in improving regression rate compared with many short diaphragms.",29,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34619,"The purpose of this experimental research is to investigate combustion characteristics of the cylindrical multiport grain of a hybrid rocket motor and to highlight port number effects on the regression rate. The physical model of concern includes an oxidizer supply system, a multiport fuel grain, and a combustor with pre- and postchamber. Several design parameters, such as the port number, fuel type (polyethylene and polymethylmethacrylate), and end-burning effects, are experimentally analyzed using small- and large-scale grain, where grain diameters of 50 and 96 mm are used, respectively. For the oxidizer mass flux ranging from 10 to , the increase of port number positively shifts the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio to near its optimum value and the increase of regression rate is damped beyond three ports, regardless of grain size. It is observed that the radiation effect on the regression rate of polyethylene is much more dominant than that of polymethylmethacrylate, and that the end-burning effect can lead to a mismeasurement of the regression rate in large-scale grain. Emphasis was placed on merging effects among fuel gain ports having four and five ports to analyze how port geometrical configuration may influence the chamber pressure and thrust drop.",29,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34382,"Acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene thermoplastic, widely mass-produced for noncombustion applications including household plumbing and structural materials, is evaluated and compared with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene as a potential fuel for hybrid rocket motors. Acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene has several mechanical properties, including its ability to be fabricated into a wide variety of shapes using fused deposition modeling, which are very attractive as a potential hybrid rocket fuel. The acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene grains were fabricated using fused deposition modeling from existing rapid-prototyping stock materials composed of butadiene, acrylonitrile, and styrene mole fractions. The acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene grains were burned with nitrous oxide as the matching oxidizer and compared for performance and consistency against fuel grains of equal size cast from hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and burned with nitrous oxide. Test results demonstrate a higher burn-to-burn consistency for acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene, but slightly reduced overall performance. Methods for increasing the burn energy of the acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene fuel grains were investigated. Equilibrium chemistry calculations conclude that, for a given oxidizer-to-fuel ratio, varying the butadiene mole fraction in the acrylonitrilebutadiene-styrene formulation has a significant effect on the propellant performance. A major result of this research is the demonstrated viability of thermoplastic as a hybrid rocket fuel grain material.",29,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34630,"A detailed theoretical/numerical framework is established to study the mechanical erosion of graphite-nozzle materials in solid rocket motors with aluminized ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene composite propellants. The analysis is based on a combined Eulerian–Lagrangian approach for treating multiphase motor flowfields. The multicomponent reacting gas-phase dynamics is formulated using the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy in the Eulerian framework. Turbulence closure is achieved using the standard two-equation model. The dispersed phase, consisting of aluminum and alumina droplets, is treated in the Lagrangian framework. Combustion of aluminum droplets to aluminum-oxide smoke is considered. Two empirical correlations are first calibrated and then employed to predict the mechanical-erosion rate of the nozzle surface. The estimated erosion rates fall within the range of the available experimental data. Mechanical erosion is prevalent in the convergent section of the rocket nozzle due to the particle impingement on the nozzle surface. No such erosion, however, is observed at the nozzle throat or downstream because the droplet trajectories move away from the nozzle surface in those regions.",29,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34734,"An experimental investigation was conducted to study the Reynolds number influence on dual-bell transition behavior for tests inside a high-altitude simulation chamber. For the range of nozzle supply pressures tested, the nozzle Reynolds number is seen to gradually decrease from a relatively high value (of the order of for tests in sea-level atmospheric conditions) toward the transitional range (lower side of for tests inside the high-altitude chamber). This influences the width of the inflection region, which is seen to decrease with an increase in nozzle Reynolds number. Because of the smaller negative pressure gradient experienced during sneak transition with a decrease in nozzle Reynolds number, the separation point is seen to move into the region of wall inflection much earlier and tends to stay in the region of wall inflection for a relatively longer time. Although the time duration of final transition remains more or less constant for different nozzle supply pressure values, the time duration for the separation point to move from its location at the inflection point to the point of minimum wall pressure in nozzle extension shows a significant increase in value with a decrease in nozzle Reynolds number. These conditions are conducive in delaying the transition to higher nozzle pressure ratios with a decrease in nozzle supply pressure. The preceding study therefore indicates that the scaling effects can very strongly dominate the results of dual-bell tests conducted inside high-altitude test facilities.",29,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34733,"Recently developed theoretical work in which energy (the first law of thermodynamics) and entropy (the second law of thermodynamics) considerations are consistently applied to aerospace vehicles is used to provide a detailed exergy (availability) and performance analysis for an airbreathing hypersonic vehicle. An acceleration and climb mission at constant freestream dynamic pressure is performed with detailed instantaneous and time-integrated audits of entropy generation in and over the vehicle and in the vehicle wake. Entropy generation in the vehicle wake ranges from five to eight times the total entropy generation in and over the vehicle. The impact of irreversibility occurring in and over the vehicle itself on the total entropy generation in the wake is a small fraction of the overall wake losses. Fifteen percent of the overall energy input during the mission actually goes into productive acceleration and climb. The remainder is associated with the generation of entropy due to irreversibility in and over the vehicle and in the vehicle wake. The propulsion system is responsible for almost all entropy generation associated solely with the vehicle (excluding the overwhelmingly dominant contribution of the vehicle wake), and entropy generation in the combustor alone represents 85% of the total propulsion system loss.",29,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34735,"In scramjet engines, burning in the supersonic stream must always cause relatively higher heat addition losses. It has been always a major concern to seek the ideal heat release of supersonic combustion to the smallest entropy increase, which corresponds to the performance limit of supersonic combustion. Many of the efforts to date have centered on parameterizing the heat release and then performing parameter optimizations. Inevitably, the parameterization will introduce high-dimensional problems due to the infinite degree of freedom of heat addition. In the present study, the problem of optimizing heat release is viewed from a perspective of the functional and calculus of variations. Different from the previous studies devoted to finding the optimal parameters in the finite-dimensional parameter space, the present study attempts to seek the ideal heat release of supersonic combustion in the infinite-dimensional function space. Mathematically, the optimization problem is a constrained maximization of the functional with differential equation constraints and fixed endpoints. Correspondingly, the method of optimal control and Lagrange multipliers is applied to solving the optimal solution of the functional, subject to the physical constraints. Solutions of the ideal heat release of supersonic combustion in both constant-area combustors and diverging combustors are provided.",29,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34740,"This paper presents the numerical simulations and the performance analysis of a scramjet inlet as part of a combined experimental and numerical study. A well-validated finite volume flow solver was used to simulate a scramjet inlet with a double ramp configuration for outer compression, including varying degrees of sidewall compression. The computed wall pressure and heat transfer in the symmetry plane are in close agreement with the measurements, and the numerical results indicate that the weak sidewall compression alters the inlet performance significantly. The effects of partial relaminarization over the expansion corner, before the interior part of the inlet, is isolated and investigated in both the experiment and simulation. It is shown that relaminarization of a boundary layer is predicted accurately using the current numerical methods. This work represents a contribution to the understanding of the effects of sidewall compression and relaminarization in designing a scramjet inlet.",29,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34524,"The authors developed a stinger-shaped injector (stinger injector) for supersonic combustors in cold-flow experiments. The stinger injector has a port geometry with a sharp leading edge in front of a streamwise slit. This injector produced higher jet penetration at a lower jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio than a conventional circular injector. We applied the injector in a Mach 2.44 combustion test at a stagnation temperature of 2060 K. At a low fuel-equivalence ratio regime (i.e., low regime), the injector produced 10% higher pressure thrust than the circular injector because of high jet penetration as expected from the cold-flow experiments. Even at a moderate regime, the stinger injector produced higher pressure thrust than the circular injector. At moderate , the stinger injector held the flame around the injector and generated a precombustion shock wave in front of the injector. The presence of the precombustion shock wave decreased the momentum flux of the crossflow air and diminished the advantage of the injector for jet penetration. The injector, however, produced higher pressure thrust because better flame-holding produced higher pressure around the injector. At a higher regime, the precombustion shock wave went upstream with both injectors. The far-upstream presence of a precombustion shock wave increased the turbulence in the crossflow and spread the fuel from both injectors. Thus, the difference in injector shape was insignificant for thrust performance.",29,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34722,"To characterize the impact of thermal nonequilibrium in shock-induced combustion scramjets, several thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed. Specifically, the effects that would be encountered in shock-tunnel testing are of interest. Therefore, thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations are run for a Mach 6 shock-tunnel nozzle and a radical farming scramjet model with total enthalpies between 3.3 and . Simulating both the nozzle and scramjet with thermal nonequilibrium represents the shock-tunnel test, whereas equilibrium inflow into a scramjet simulated in thermal nonequilibrium provides the scenario encountered in actual flight. For all nonequilibrium simulations, the Landau–Teller model in combination with modified Millikan and White thermal relaxation coefficients is used. It is shown that modeling the entire flow as being in thermal equilibrium results in higher effective temperatures within the local high-temperature regions where ignition occurs, which causes the ignition length to decrease and thus the combustion process to be more efficient compared with the nonequilibrium cases. Additionally, the conditions for ignition in simulations representing shock-tunnel experiments are found to be more favorable than in the simulations representing a flight test, assuming the same enthalpy and boundary conditions. Furthermore, these differences are found to be insensitive to the total enthalpy.",29,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34521,"The characteristics of hydrogen jets transversely injected into a supersonic crossflow under four different injection and crossflow conditions were investigated by large-eddy simulation. The effects of the jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio and crossflow velocity were studied. The jet trajectory in the averaged field was controlled by the value of the square root of the jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio irrespective of the crossflow conditions. When the crossflow conditions were fixed many jet characteristics were similar in the space normalized using the square root of jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio. On the other hand, the crossflow conditions had a strong impact on the jet characteristics. Although the turbulent intensity around the jet was not affected to a great extent, the shape and convection velocity of the large-scale structures appearing on the windward side of the jet plume depended on the crossflow conditions. With a higher crossflow velocity the convection velocity was higher, the jet was more intermittent, and the progress of mixing was slower. The turbulent mixing state had different features depending on the crossflow conditions.",29,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34701,"Aluminum is an attractive energy storage material for underwater propulsion because of its high density and strongly exothermic reaction with seawater. However, the degree to which an aluminum–seawater power system could outperform other systems has remained unknown because of uncertainties about volume and energy costs associated with the balance of plant. This work addresses this problem by developing a thermodynamic model for a complete Rankine-cycle propulsion system based on the aluminum–seawater reaction and combining this with a scaling methodology for inferring the system’s effective energy density. The results show that replacing battery-based power systems with aluminum combustion based ones could increase range/endurance by factors of four to ten over competing technologies. Overall system efficiency is maximized by adjusting the water mass flow to fuel mass flow ratio so as to control the temperature and quantity of steam. Although increasing the amount of combustion byproduct, hydrogen, improves the performance of the turbine, the thermodynamic cost of compressing the hydrogen can be very high. As a result, developing a compact device for achieving an isothermal compression of waste hydrogen is necessary to fully realize the energy density advantage of the aluminum fuel.",29,3

The following conclusions have been made: the magnesium-based metal fuel could combust steadily with water under a suitable water/fuel ratio, and the combustion efficiency and ejection efficiency rose at first and then declined with an increasing first water/fuel ratio, which demonstrates the existence of an optimum water/fuel ratio; the time of the pressure climbing period could be reduced, and the engine performance could be improved by the increasing burning rate; and a specific impulse of the engine could be improved by adding secondary water injection, and a specific impulse of was reached in the experiment on the ground.",29,3
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34675,"The experimental study in this paper focused on the combustion wave temperature measurement and the qualitative observation of phenomena involved in the combustion of a high-metal magnesium-based hydroreactive fuel strand, using a pressure-regulated test combustor. An experimental system was designed and experiments were carried out in both argon and water vapor atmosphere. Two types of hydroreactive fuel were investigated: one containing 60% magnesium particles and the other one containing 73% magnesium particles. Thermal-wave structures of the combustion wave of the hydroreactive fuel were measured by an imbedded type-K fine-wire thermocouple. The surfaces of fuel samples quenched by rapid depressurization were examined in a scanning electron microscope. The chemical composition on the burned surface of the hydroreactive fuel strand was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. The experimental phenomena implies that magnesium particles in the 60% magnesium fuel are ejected into the gas phase and combust, whereas magnesium particles in the 73% magnesium fuel stay on the burning surface and combust. Using these experimental results, the effect of the amounts of metal additives on the combustion of the high-metal magnesium-based hydroreactive fuel was postulated and the physical combustion model was proposed.",29,3
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34616,"This paper presents a linear method to postprocess unsteady computations as tied to a fluctuating energy balance. In the field of solid rocket propulsion, this method can be useful to analyze unstable motors with periodic pressure fluctuations within the two-phase flow. It allows one to determine the main fluctuating energy sources in the motor. Derivation of the method is presented in this paper. Moreover, using a simple test case, a fluctuating energy balance approach is compared with a classical linear acoustic balance approach. Both methods produce satisfactory results, but the fluctuating energy balance approach captures more of the physics. Cases, respectively, exhibiting thermoacoustic interaction and parietal vortex shedding are also addressed to show the assets of the fluctuating energy balance approach in comparison with the acoustic balance method.",29,3
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34718,"This work is focused on the numerical analysis of pollutant formation in an aviation gas turbine engine at different values of power setting. The analysis is conducted on the basis of a comprehensive approach treating the reactor net model for description of nonequilibrium chemical processes inside the combustor and the quasi-one-dimensional model to compute the evolution of species concentrations in the postcombustor flow. Special attention is paid to the study of the formation of volatile aerosol precursors: sulfuric and nitrous acids and organic compounds. The applied approach provides a reasonable agreement between predictions and measurements of emission indices for main pollutants , CO, , , and . It is shown that, whereas the concentrations of the main components of combustion exhaust, , CO, , and , vary only slightly in the turbine and nozzle flow, the concentrations of sulfur compounds ( and ) and other condensable species (, , and ) can change noticeably. The simulation also demonstrates that the concentration of organic condensable matter (, , and ) in the engine exhaust can be comparable to (or even greater than) the concentration of sulfuric acid at 85 and 30% power setting, even at a moderate value of sulfur fuel content .",29,3
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34598,"This experimental campaign focused on the analysis of the feasibility for impulse generation of a repetitively pulsed airbreathing laser lightcraft at hypersonic speeds. The future application of interest for this basic research endeavor is the laser launch of nano- and microsatellites (i.e., 1–100 kg payloads) into low Earth orbit, at low cost and on demand. These laser propulsion experiments employed a hypersonic shock tunnel, integrated with twin gigawatt pulsed Lumonics 620-TEA lasers to produce the required test conditions. Time-dependent surface pressure distributions were recorded together with schlieren movies of the flowfield structure resulting from the laser energy deposition, at nominal Mach numbers ranging from 6 to 10. The laser induced breakdown occurring off-surface and across the inlet’s midchannel was analyzed and discussed against previous theoretical and experimental results. The data indicated laser induced pressure increases of 0.7–0.9 bar with laser pulse energies of , on an off-shroud induced breakdown condition and a freestream Mach number of six. The results of this research corroborate the feasibility of laser powered airbreathing flight with infinite specific impulse .",29,3
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34875,"Single pulse shock-tube experiments were conducted examining how ignition delay may be influenced by the interactive chemistry of fuels and their pyrolytic and oxidative decomposition products. Ignition delay was not measured directly but is assumed to be positively correlated to the temperature (above 1000 K) at which is formed in constant time experiments. Using this definition, it was found that heptane, ethylene, heptane–ethylene, and heptane–ethylene–methane mixtures had similar formation temperatures. This suggests that the primary reasons for the difference in ignition delay of the individual constituents and their mixtures are the reactions of the parent fuel leading to formation of the smaller molecules and the thermochemistry of the system. In contrast, heptane–iso-octane mixtures had different onset temperatures compared with pure components, suggesting that the cross reactions between radical pools of both components affect the overall chemistry. Heptane and iso-octane, pure and in mixtures, would then be expected to have different ignition delays, as has been observed. Simulating the experimental results using models available in the literature led to large variability of predictions. None of the models were deemed sufficient to reveal the chemical pathways responsible for the observed results.",29,3
