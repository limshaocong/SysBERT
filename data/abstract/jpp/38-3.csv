In such engines, the fuel–film transitions from a liquid to supercritical state, leaving behind dense and soot layers of carbonaceous deposits. We used a 4.8 MPa kerosene– fuel–film cooled combustor with removable chamber liner samples for posttest analysis of carbonaceous deposits. Dense layer deposit depths were measured in cross-sectioned samples with a dual-beam scanning electron microscope. The varying fuel–film flow rate did not affect deposit depths in the near field. However, higher film flow rates resulted in longer regions of carbonaceous deposits in the far field. The dense and soot layers were hypothesized to be formed by heterogeneous condensation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and thermophoretic diffusion of soot, respectively.",38,3

The ignition of quasi-homogeneous Al/water mixtures was successfully implemented by employing a novel ignition method, and self-sustained flame propagation was obtained in the mixtures over a broad range of fuel-equivalence ratio . The burning rates, flammability limits, and thermal structure of the propagating flame were determined. The combustion products were also analyzed. For the particle sizes considered, the burning rates were found to first increase and then decrease as increased, with the maximum values occurring at and substantially lower than nano- mixtures. The dependence of the burning rate on particle size follows a power law, , indicating that the reaction process of and water is kinetically controlled. Base on the experimental observations, a simplified flame propagation model was developed to provide insight into the effects of particle size and equivalence ratio. Combustion product analyses revealed that Al residues increased as was further increased from 0.7, and the combustion efficiency of aluminum decreased accordingly.",38,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38495,"The effects of decreasing pressure on the spatial and temperature evolution of spark kernels are reported in this work. This effort is motivated by the need to ensure that combustors and augmentors consistently ignite at high altitudes, where the pressure is reduced. Spark kernels were produced in air at 300–1000 mbar. Infrared radiation emitted by the spark kernels was measured using an infrared camera (FLIR SC6700). Temperatures were determined from the radiation measurements using an inverse deconvolution technique. Spark kernels travel faster and further from the igniter as pressure is reduced. Radiation from spark kernels was detected up to three igniter diameters from the igniter tip at 1000 mbar, and at least 3.4 diameters at 300 mbar. Peak temperatures within kernels decrease with decreases in pressure. For example, peak temperatures (i.e., the 90th percentile temperatures) were 2070 and 2360 K at 380 and 1000 mbar, respectively. In contrast, average kernel temperatures increase with decreases in pressure. This trend is attributed to less mass in the spark kernel being heated as a result of the reduced density. The estimated sensible energy of the kernels decreased from 0.8 J at 1000 mbar to 0.25 J at 300 mbar.",38,3

Two new aspects are that the finite-rate chemistry of a hydrocarbon (JP-7) fuel was added for the first time, and certain tradeoffs were quantified that arise due to the short vehicle length (4.6 m), which narrows the operating ranges of ram and scram modes. A goal was to maximize the operating range of the ram mode, which is limited by unstart, as well as the range of the scram mode, which is limited by incomplete fuel burn. Four parameters were varied: fuel–air equivalence ratio, Mach number, fuel injector diameter, and number of fuel injectors. Results indicate that achieving an acceptable design is complicated by the mixing–reaction–strain out tradeoff. A solution was achieved by directing the fuel to two sets of wall injectors having small diameters for ram mode and larger diameters for scram mode. Results demonstrate the need to include finite-rate chemistry to properly compute the heat release profile and interactions between the inlet, isolator, combustor, and thermal choking.",38,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38484,"A combined experimental and computational approach has been used to investigate the stall inception mechanisms and subsequent poststall behavior of a single-stage axial compressor running at different operating conditions, determined by its rotational speed. This paper emphasizes differences in the origin of stall inception depending on the associated inlet flow regimes: 60% speed (subsonic), 80% speed (transonic), and 100% speed (supersonic). At all speeds, stall is initiated with spike-type disturbances that develop into full-span rotating stall. This paper demonstrates for the first time that for a single compressor geometry, a variety of mechanisms can be responsible for the sources of the blockage leading to stall inception depending on the rotational speed. At 60% speed, the inlet flow is subsonic and the primary driver is a corner separation forming between the casing and blade suction surface. At 80% speed, the spillage of tip leakage jet ahead of the leading-edge plane combines with a small shock-induced corner separation to cause sufficient total blockage and subsequent stall inception. Finally, at 100% speed, the mechanisms are the same as at 80% speed but with a greater blockage contribution from the corner separation due to a stronger shock creating a larger separation.",38,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38590,"This work presents theoretical and experimental performance studies and a general scheme of an innovative concept for propelling marine high-speed underwater vehicles, a water-breathing hybrid ram rocket. The water-augmented hybrid ram rocket enables obtaining superior performance relatively to a standard rocket and improved performance relatively to a parallel water–augmented solid ram rocket. In addition, it demonstrates improved safety and controllability due to the hybrid motor characteristics. The theoretical model incorporated data from a thermochemical program. The experimental investigation was based on static firing tests of hybrid rocket motors augmented by the addition of water during combustion. The study focused on the use of a non-water-reactive propellant combination, cured polyester as fuel and gaseous oxygen as oxidizer. Wide ranges of oxidizer-to-fuel and water-to-propellant ratios were considered. The experimental results showed a significant improvement (up to 70%) in specific impulse, relatively to a non-water-augmented hybrid rocket, in good accordance with the theoretical results. It is concluded that for standard chamber pressure of 6.9 MPa, corresponding to the ram pressure for cruising at , a specific impulse greater than 400 s can be achieved by a water-augmented hybrid ram rocket using a non-hydro-reactive fuel.",38,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38487,"Extensive research studying tip clearance effects on compressor performance has been conducted during the past few decades with significant progress achieved. However, most of the previous investigations focus on stage-level analysis at the design condition, with very limited studies at the component level or part speed conditions. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the effects of impeller tip clearance on the performance of a high-speed centrifugal compressor, at both stage and component levels, covering a variety of operating speeds resulting in subsonic to transonic inlet conditions. Experiments were conducted on the Single Stage Centrifugal Compressor facility at two different running tip clearances. With increased clearance, the stage and impeller pressure ratio, isentropic efficiency, and work factor drop, but the static pressure recovery coefficient in the diffuser increases. As the compressor transitions from subsonic to transonic operation from 60 to 85% corrected speed, the sensitivities of stage and impeller pressure ratio and efficiency reach their peak values. Lastly, numerical simulations at design speed showed that the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model sufficiently predicts the sensitivities due to tip clearance for most of the parameters at the stage and component levels, indicating the potential of using CFD to investigate the flow physics.",38,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38547,"Nozzle throat erosion in hybrid rocket engines is generally more emphasized than in solid rockets due to a greater concentration of oxidizing species in the combustion products. Therefore, its accurate understanding and modeling is of fundamental importance in order to correctly predict motor performance and possibly to help reducing the associated losses. Moreover, throttling and/or mixture ratio shift can significantly alter the conditions under which the thermal protection material is operating, further complicating the problem. The aim of this work is to numerically investigate the graphite nozzle erosion in hybrid rockets burning high-density polyethylene and oxygen. Nozzle throat erosion rate and wall temperature are evaluated as a function of the operating conditions by performing numerical simulations with a proven in-house computational fluid dynamics solver. The results obtained from a detailed parametric analysis are discussed and then used to derive a general closed-form regression law for rapid estimation of nozzle throat erosion rate for the analyzed propellant combination that is dependent on the operating conditions, chamber pressure and mixture ratio, and on the nozzle geometry. The possible role of combustion efficiency is also discussed. The regression law is then validated through comparison with the experimental results obtained from several lab-scale 2-kN-thrust-class firing tests, underlining a good ability to correctly capture the average nozzle erosion mass flux behavior with the operating conditions and highlighting the different role of the driving parameters.",38,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38427,"A cylindrical rotating detonation engine (24  mm diameter) with multiple injector holes on the combustor side wall for both propellant injection and cooling by injector gas flow was designed and tested. As each set of injectors created its own detonations, the synchronized detonation waves propagated along the three injector rows. From the axial view, those detonation combustion regions stood off from the injector surface as the non-well-mixed propellant existed between the wall and the combustion zone. This combustion region tended to broaden in lateral and radial directions as the mass flow rate increased by pushing its region with the injected propellant. Wall heat flux and heat balance were evaluated by a one-dimensional unsteady heat transfer model with propellant injection cooling. Even when the flow rate was doubled, the increase in the wall heat flux was only 18–25%. This heat trend and the image of standoff self-chemiluminescence from the injector surface implied that a non-well-mixed unburned propellant acted as a heat-reduction layer to ease heat load into the combustor. Measurements and thermal analysis verified the flow structure near the injector and heat-exchange mechanism due to the propellant gas flow, which has a potential for thermal steady operation.",38,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38073,"The near-field dynamics of a rectangular heated overexpanded jet of aspect ratio two is examined with an implicit large-eddy simulation using experimental data for validation purposes. The conical nozzle, representative of practical configurations, results in multiple shock trains from the throat region as well as the overexpanded operating condition. Each train introduces unsteadiness that influences the external shock cell and plume structure. A detailed analysis of the terms contributing to the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is performed to examine the evolution of the plume. The major-axis shear layer experiences significant amplification of the TKE compared with the minor axis, particularly near the core collapse region, and thus pressure fluctuations in the near acoustic field are correspondingly larger in that direction. The most prominent source of TKE in this region is associated with strong mean flow gradients across the major-axis shear layer, and larger corresponding cross-correlations of velocity fluctuations. These effects are shown to be consistent with protrusions of vortical perturbations arising in the minor-axis shear layer into the potential core. The evolution of pressure perturbations from asymmetric to axisymmetric occurs relatively quickly, to achieve agreement with far-field experimental data.",38,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38634,"The present paper reports optomechanical and quantum electronical analyses of the mechanism of photonic laser thruster (PLT) in achieving spacecraft velocities on the order of by using macroscale laser-like optical resonators. One remarkable result is that the resonance condition of the PLT optical cavity imposes the magnitude of the dynamic frequency shift of the circulating laser beam wavefunction by the moving mirror to equal that of the single-reflection Doppler shift of a nonresonant laser beam. However, their mechanisms are proven completely different. The optomechanical dynamics of PLT was analytically investigated and the chief results are as follows: 1) the maximum achievable PLT spacecraft velocity with existing laser technologies is estimated to be ; 2) for interplanetary propulsion applications the optimum range of the intrinsic PLT cavity power loss factors from absorption, scattering, and diffraction is ; and 3) the efficiency of transforming the laser energy to the spacecraft kinetic energy increases over 40% at velocities greater than . The present results validate the theoretical feasibility of PLT to enable unprecedentedly fast interplanetary transportation systems, such as the Photonic Railways. The required engineering and manufacturing capabilities for implementing the interplanetary PLT are discussed.",38,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38507,"The spray and spray combustion characteristics of rocket-grade kerosene (Isrosene) loaded with graphene nanoplatelets and aluminum nanoparticles are investigated in this study. A shear coaxial injector with recess was employed to generate the nanofluid spray flowing through the center orifice and 99.98% oxygen through the annular gap. The mass flow rate was maintained at for both the fuel and oxidizer streams, and the flame was nonconfined. Effect of nanoparticles on droplet size of the sprays, flame liftoff height, flame temperature, and CO emissions were measured. Droplet size measurement was conducted using a laser-based nonintrusive technique (MALVERN particle sizer). It was observed that for the same mass flow rates of the fuel and oxygen, the droplet size of the spray increased by 50% due to the addition of nanoparticles. The direct videography method was used to visualize the flame shape and size, and it was observed that the flame liftoff height decreased by 50 and 10% due to the addition of graphene and aluminum nanoparticles, respectively. The presence of nanoparticles enhanced the reaction rate, which was concluded based on the measurement of flame temperature and CO concentrations.",38,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38405,"The results of plasma simulations in a discharge chamber of a Direct Current gridded ion thruster are dependent on the choice of anomalous electron conductivity model. Usually, additional electron diffusion is used to reproduce the experimental conductivity level. Up-to-date, the existing numerical models use different values of the additional diffusion coefficient, and this choice is often nonrigorous or insufficiently justified. In this research, the influence of the additional diffusion coefficient on the results of an axisymmetrical Full-Particle in Cell simulation of plasma in the discharge chamber of a Direct Current gridded ion thruster was investigated. The modeled thruster had a rated power of 3 kW, a thrust of 85 mN, and a specific impulse of 4500 s. The magnitude of the additional diffusion was varied from zero to the value of Bohm diffusion . gave the best agreement of the simulation results with the experimental data for the chosen thruster. A qualitative analysis of the plasma parameter distributions inside the discharge chamber at various anomalous electron conductivity coefficients is also provided. The profile of the ion current density through the ion-optical system obtained in the simulation is in sufficient agreement with experimental data.",38,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38413,"This study investigates the ignition and combustion behavior of the recently developed green hypergolic combination named HIP_11 in a small thruster. The combination HIP_11 consists of highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide as oxidizer and a fuel based on the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (EMIM SCN) with addition of copper thiocyanate (Cu SCN) to facilitate the hypergolic ignition. A dedicated thruster, featuring a 2-on-1 unlike impinging jet injector, was designed and manufactured. The initial tests were conducted with the injector only, without the combustion chamber mounted. These tests were conducted with two different amounts of catalyst: 1% and 5% Cu SCN. Subsequently, three hot firing series (around 35 tests) were conducted with the complete thruster, using the propellant combination 97% high-test peroxide and EMIM Cu SCN. The propellant mass flow rates were varied between 7 and and the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio from 3 to 7.",38,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38573,"High-performance scramjet engines suitable for hypersonic flight are achievable with better integration of propulsion, airframe, and materials disciplines during the conceptual design stage. The engine’s performance is strongly coupled with the airframe configuration due to the engine’s typical integration into the fuselage. Therefore, this work’s objective is to develop a conceptual design tool capable of predicting the engine’s one-dimensional flow properties and performance based on its geometry and flight conditions for rapid creation of feasible vehicle configurations. Proper propulsion modeling is required to efficiently determine if the engine and vehicle configuration meet desired mission goals. Propulsion analysis methods that are representative of the engine’s capabilities and allow for improvements to these predictions are focused on in this work. The engine analysis model developed is a stream thrust analysis with additions to several submodels for higher-fidelity analyses. Quasi-one-dimensional approaches are used to approximate isolator, combustor, and nozzle performance with sensitivities to area change, skin friction, wall heat transfer, and fuel addition/combustion. The methodology provides a computationally efficient engine modeling tool for optimizing multiple parameters. This model rapidly provides the operating conditions of the engine for integration with the airframe module for thermal and structural analysis via finite element analysis.",38,3
