A practical image processing method was developed to analyze the visualization results quantitatively. The cavitation tests were carried out both before and after deaeration at room temperature. It was found that air content has little influence on the cavitation performance, though higher air content distinctly facilitates the cavitation inception. Comparison of the cavitation performance and cavitating structures at different temperatures shows that the intensity of the thermodynamic effect is closely related to the working condition. At a lower cavitation number and flow coefficient (, ), the thermodynamic effect is stronger to suppress the cavitation development inside the inducer, and thus the breakdown point is delayed. But at a larger flow coefficient , higher temperatures show promotion effects on the cavitation breakdown. A semi-empirical theoretical model was employed to quantitatively predict the influence of the thermodynamic effect on the cavitation performance, and the predicted results match well with the experimental results.",36,3

The candidate alternative fuels (C-1, C-5, C-7, and, C-8 synthetic blends) were compared to Jet-A (A-2). The drop size and drop velocity were measured using phase Doppler anemometry at three measurement planes downstream of the swirler exit. The representative diameters [, , and the mass mean diameter (MMD)] were used to characterize the drop size. The drop velocity was characterized using the arithmetic mean and the root mean square. An increase in the swirler pressure drop showed a decrease in the mean drop size and an increase in the magnitude of the axial drop velocity. Comparing the different fuels generally showed an increase in for higher fuel viscosity. However, definitive trends in and the MMD were not observed, based on fuel physical properties such as viscosity, surface tension, or density. A variation of the fuel injection pressure showed no significant effect for both the standard and alternative fuels. The full cone angle (obtained using shadowgraph images) was found to not vary significantly with or .",36,3

The implementation is validated by comparison to past experimental measurements obtained for the NASA-300M thruster that operated with both xenon and krypton. For xenon, the computed thrust matches experimental values to within 6%, whereas for krypton the difference is only 1.8%. From simulations at the same thruster power level, the krypton propellant specific impulse is 15% higher than that for xenon, and the thrust is only 17% lower than that for xenon. These results are consistent with a simple theoretical calculation and experimental values. Next, the unshielded H6 thruster, which has not yet operated experimentally with krypton propellant, is also simulated for both gases at the same power level. The flow rate for krypton is reduced by 28% to maintain the 6 kW power level used for xenon propellant. The performance trends observed are consistent with the NASA-300M thruster simulations. Although the singly charged ion current fraction for xenon is 11% lower than that for krypton, for the doubly and triply charged species the trend is reversed. This behavior is expected when considering the relative differences in cross sections between the various ionization processes.",36,3

This research presents the first quantitative assessment on the influence of inlet boundary layer thickness and asymmetry on the swirl distortion at the exit of an S-shaped intake. Measurements of high spatial and temporal resolution have been acquired at the outlet plane of the S-duct using time-resolved particle image velocimetry. When boundary layer profiles typical of embedded engines are introduced, the characteristic secondary flows at the outlet plane are intensified. Overall, the peak swirl intensity increases by 40% for a boundary layer which is seven times thicker than the reference case. The unsteady modes of the S-duct remain, although the dominant fluctuations in the flow arise at a frequency 50% lower. When the inlet boundary layer profile becomes asymmetric about the intake centerline, the peak swirl events at the hub are reduced by up to 40%. At the tip, the peak swirl intensity increases by 29%. The results demonstrate that the effects of inlet boundary layer thickness and asymmetry must be carefully considered as part of engine compatibility tests for complex intakes.",36,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37671,"Estimates of energy and power requirements for shortening the ignition delay time in hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet engines using nonequilibrium plasma generation of radicals show that the uniform volumetric plasma ignition would be associated with extremely high power budget and substantial losses of total pressure. A multipoint plasma ignition scheme based on electron beams is proposed that would emulate the volumetric ignition while reducing the power budget by several orders of magnitude. The paper also explores an approach where the fuel is injected into the core flow as a liquid jet, and low-power electron beams are used to electrostatically charge the droplets and thus to control droplet breakup, atomization, mixing, and ignition. With a subcritical microwave field applied to the injection region, local enhancement of electric field strength at the surface of droplets, together with seed electrons and ions produced by the electron beam, would create subcritical microwave discharges and thus initiate combustion in multiple spots. The multispot ignition would help in spreading the flame across the combustor. Additionally, the initiation of combustion at the droplet surface, where local equivalence ratio is high, could help ignite lean (in average) mixtures.",36,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37627,"The first objective of this work is the verification of a moving-body immersed boundary method for the direct computation of noise generated by rotor-stator interactions in transonic 2-D cascades. This method is based on a discrete forcing approach where the boundary conditions are directly imposed at the surface of moving and static cascades immersed in a domain discretized by a regular Cartesian grid. The numerical method is verified using the mode generation and propagation theory applied to thin annular ducts for two-dimensional cascades. Two cases are simulated, the rotor alone and the rotor-stator interaction. For the first case, all computed modes are generated following the Tyler-Sofrin rule, but none of them are cut-on, as predicted by the duct propagation theory. For the second case, all modes are also generated in accordance with that rule, and the numerical results for the cut-on modes are also in excellent agreement with the duct propagation theory regarding mode number, signal, and angle of the wavefront. The second objective is to study the effect of decreasing rotor-stator separation on tone and broadband noise.",36,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37707,"The predictive numerical simulation of near-limit turbulent premixed combustion, in which the turbulent intensity is high and the fuel/air mixture is near the flammability limit, remains challenging. In this study, large-eddy simulation (LES)/filtered density function (FDF) simulations of a high-speed piloted premixed jet burner flame are performed to illustrate the importance of the resolved level of reactive scalars and micromixing modeling on predicting the overall combustion process. The simulations with increased resolved levels of reactive scalars yield notably improved predictions throughout the extinction–reignition region of this flame. The sources of grid sensitivity are thoroughly examined through the quantification of the resolved levels of the velocity and scalar fields, as well as the mixing-reaction budgets. Subgrid mixing is identified as the most prominent factor for grid sensitivity. The effects of mixing timescale modeling are investigated and quantified through a parametric study of the mixing rate parameter and the development of an augmented hybrid mixing timescale model in the LES context. As far as the mixing formulation is concerned, the Euclidean minimum spanning tree model shows a lower level of grid dependence than the interaction by exchange with the mean model due to the enforcement of localness in composition space.",36,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37665,"This paper discusses the impacts of oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio shifts on the flight performance of single-stage sounding rockets using the flight simulations of three scales of -controlled and -uncontrolled hybrid rockets under a nominal fuel regression behavior without uncertainty. The flight simulation code includes three factors dependent on the : thermodynamic states of the burned gas (theoretical ), shifts in efficiency, and nozzle throat erosion. In the flight simulations, a thrust control law was applied to increase the apogee and evaluate the effects of shifts in the thrust curve including throttling. For the best cases in each scale, -controlled hybrid rockets slightly improved the performance by 2.03–2.42% in the averaged specific impulse. However, the performance of the -controlled sounding rockets is essentially the same as the -uncontrolled type under the median regression behavior: especially when considering the slight increases in the mass and complexity of the oxidizer feed system needed for control. Considerable scale effects on the throat erosion and theoretical were observed, but that of the efficiency was negligible. The improvement of the theoretical was the primary contributor to flight performance, which was responsible for a larger than 70% share in the total increase. The second largest contribution was the improvement of the efficiency with a share of 21.8–24.3%. The control gave an improvement of throat erosion corresponding to 5.75% in the total increase for the smallest scale; but, with increasing of the scale, the throat area increase ratio became small so that the throat erosion improvement contribution was reduced to 1.21%.",36,3

In this study, the thrust and side force are numerically investigated using a simple explosion source model considering the beam size, explosion source energy, and axial offset between the beam and target as the parameters. It is established that the thrust, as well as the side force, is sensitive to the ratio of the laser-beam radius to the sphere radius . The impulsive thrust force is maximum at approximately, whereas a positive side force (i.e., recovery force) can be generated only if is greater than a critical value of approximately 0.8. These trends are explained with respect to shock focusing and laser ablation.",36,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37568,"A recently developed reconstruction technique is used to investigate graphite nozzle erosion in two scales of hybrid rocket motors, 30-N-thrust class and 2000-N-thrust class, using oxygen as the oxidizer and high-density polyethylene as the fuel. Thermocouple measurements taken from within the nozzles are used to estimate nozzle throat wall temperature. Forty-four static firing tests were conducted under varying experimental conditions to confirm the validity of the reconstruction technique results, to investigate the conditions at the onset of erosion, and to formulate an empirical predictive model of nozzle erosion rate. Results show that a single formula that treats the combustion gas as a single oxidizing agent for which heterogenous rate constants are functions of equivalence ratio can satisfactorily replicate the erosion rate of graphite by a combustion gas containing multiple oxidizing species. Furthermore, the chemical-kinetic-limited conditions of the onset of nozzle erosion are specified by a novel empirical correlation, which shows that erosion begins at lower temperature and pressure in oxidizer-rich combustion gas than in fuel-rich combustion gas.",36,3

The viabilities of hypergolic ignition and ignition delay (ID) times were measured for a range of conditions, including LAH loading in paraffin and ignition test chamber pressure. A strong inverse trend between ID and pressure was observed for the reaction of AR-grade nitric acid and pure LAH. A minimum of 50% mass loading of LAH in paraffin wax was required for reliable hypergolic ignition with AR-grade nitric acid at atmospheric pressure under a pure nitrogen environment.",36,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37749,"Outgassing of oxygen from fuel is an important phenomenon affecting the ullage oxygen concentration of aircraft fuel tanks, which is a critical operating parameter associated with the risk of explosions due to hazards such as electric sparks or combat damage. Knowledge of the outgassing characteristics of specific fuels in their operational environment is important to fuel system designers. Although the factors affecting the evolution rate of dissolved gases from solution, such as pressure, temperature, and agitation, have been characterized to some extent, the effect of bubble generation on the bulk rate of outgassing to the ullage space has not been well described in the literature. The motivation for the present work was to study the effect of bubbles naturally induced by fuel pumps on the outgassing of JP-8 during depressurizations that are typical for climb and high-altitude cruise. An experimental fuel tank model was developed that included visualization windows, oxygen measurements in the fuel and ullage, and a vacuum system enabling controlled depressurization down to 0.1 atm. Significant differences between bubble-up and diffusion-driven outgassing are evident in the analysis of oxygen concentration trends with time under various test conditions. The ullage oxygen volume fraction is significantly increased during depressurization when agitation is accompanied by small bubbles, in comparison to quiet conditions. Ullage washing before depressurization affects the initial state but not the overall transient characteristics, regardless of whether agitation is applied.",36,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37735,"A combustor was developed to operate with natural gas and air as the primary propellants at elevated chamber pressures and air preheat temperatures representative of land-based power generation gas turbine engines. Detonation dynamics were studied to characterize the operability of rotating detonation-based pressure gain combustion systems for this application. Measurements of chamber wave dynamics were performed using high-frequency pressure transducers and high-speed imaging of broadband combustion chemiluminescence. The rotating detonation engine was tested with two injector configurations across a broad range of mass flux , equivalence ratio (0.85–1.2), and oxygen mass fraction (23.2–35%) conditions to determine the effect of operating parameters on the propagation of detonation waves in the combustor. Wave propagation speeds of up to 70% of the mixture Chapman–Jouguet detonation velocity and chamber pressure fluctuations greater than 4 times the mean chamber pressure were observed. Supplementing the air with additional oxygen, varying the equivalence ratio, and enriching the fuel with hydrogen revealed that combustor operability is sensitive to the chemical kinetics of the propellant mixture. Comparing the operational trends of the two injector configurations suggests that one design mixes the incoming propellants more effectively. Although most test conditions exhibited counter-rotating detonation waves within the chamber, the injector design with superior mixing characteristics was able to support single-wave propagation.",36,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37685,"This paper documents a fully turbulent discrete adjoint method for three-dimensional multistage turbomachinery design. The method is based on a duality preserving algorithm and is implemented in the open-source computational fluid dynamics tool SU2. The SU2 Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver is first extended to treat three-dimensional steady turbomachinery flow using a conservative formulation of the mixing-plane coupled to nonreflective boundary conditions. The numerical features of the flow solver are automatically inherited by the discrete adjoint solver, ensuring the same convergence rate of the primal solver. The flow solver is then validated against experimental data available for three turbine configurations, namely, a one-and-half axial turbine stage, a transonic radial turbine coupled to a downstream diffuser, and a supersonic mini–organic Rankine cycle radial turbine operating with a fluid made by a heavy molecule. Finally the adjoint-based optimization framework is applied to the concurrent shape optimization of three rows of the axial turbine, demonstrating the advantages deriving from adopting multirow automated design methods in the context of turbomachinery design.",36,3
