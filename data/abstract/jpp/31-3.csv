0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35323,"Flowfield and flame-holding characteristics of ethylene jets were examined experimentally. Flow visualization and chemiluminescence images were obtained in a shock tunnel. Model configurations with and without a cowl or a cavity were tested for jet-to-freestream momentum flux ratios varying from 1.35 to 3.07. Flame-holding characteristics were studied using a cavity configuration with a cowl. Four flow conditions with the total temperature varying from 1610 to 2320 K were studied keeping the overall fuel–air equivalence ratio at 0.2. The data showed that shock impingement due to the cowl influenced the jet to penetrate shallower into the freestream than for the case without the cowl. The shock impingement reduced the fluctuating level of the jet’s periodical motion. At 2080 K, combustion was maintained inside the cavity, and this condition provided a continuous ignition downstream of the cavity (i.e., flaming holding is achieved at a much lower enthalpy than seen in the existing data). At 2320 K, the trend was similar. At temperatures lower than 2080 K, the flame holding was not maintained.",31,3

Inflow conditions with Mach number, stagnation pressure, and enthalpy of 6.44, 40.2 MPa, and , respectively, and fuel/air equivalence ratio of 0.44 were maintained, along with engine geometry. Hydrogen fuel was injected at an axial location of 92.33 mm downstream of the leading edge for each investigated injection method. Results from this study show that porous fuel-injection results in enhanced mixing and combustion compared to porthole fuel injection. This is particularly evident within the first half of the combustion chamber, where porous fuel injection resulted in mixing and combustion efficiencies of 76 and 63%, respectively. At the same location, porthole fuel injection resulted in efficiencies respectively of 58 and 46%. Key mechanisms contributing to the observed improved performance were the formation of an attached oblique fuel-injection shock and associated stronger shock-expansion train ingested by the engine, enhanced spreading of the fuel in all directions, and a more rapidly growing mixing layer.",31,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35377,"Numerical research on lifting and sealing performance of a whole ring finger seal with grooved pad structures is presented in this paper. Different groove structures on the bottom of a lifting pad, such as one and two straight grooves, or two herringbone grooves with different gradients, etc., will be simulated. For discussing interaction between the rotor and finger seal, the vibration trajectory of the rotor is taken into account in the numerical computation. Numerical simulation results indicate that the complete ring model is more suitable than an individual finger model to simulate the fluid–solid interactions of the finger seal. Deformation of the finger seal is changed by vibration of the rotor, and it should adapt the clearance in a uniform way according to the rotor position. The grooved pad structures have effects on the leakage flows and the lifting force on the finger. Analytical data revealed that the self-adaptive performance of the finger seal to rotor vibration is subsistent. The self-adaptive performance will be helpful to make the finger seal processes lower wear and with smaller leakage in a rotor–seal system.",31,3

In this paper, a panoramic map of instability evolution across all typical operations is experimentally demonstrated for the first time in a high-speed centrifugal compressor with a maximum speed of and a corresponding rotation velocity at the impeller outlet of . Twelve high-response Kulite pressure probes are mounted on the internal surface of the compressor’s casing. The experimental results show that the instability phenomena are quite complex and diverse at different operations. At low speed ( of the maximum speed), high-frequency and low-frequency stall successively occurs at the impeller, and is followed by surge as mass flow rate reduced. The transient process of surge is a transient stall/unstall self-loop, with the “self-similarity” to the sustainable stall/unstall conditions. At 70% of the maximum speed, the system exhibits two types of surge, a minor-amplitude periodic surge with a frequency close to the Helmholtz system resonance frequency, and a deep surge. There is a non-surge region between them. Meanwhile the 70% of the maximum speed is a critical speed, beyond which the stable flow range narrows down abruptly. When the compressor operates at near of the maximum speed, surge suddenly sets in from stable state and there is no preceding stall. Finally, a new “mass-spring-damper” model is introduced for the first time to illustrate the diversity of surge/stall patterns across different operations.",31,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35461,"The performance and the buzz onset of a supersonic mixed-compression axisymmetric intake are experimentally investigated. Effects of the slot bleed position, angle, and width on the intake performance and on the buzz initiation at three different Mach numbers of 1.8, 2.0, and 2.2 and at a zero degree angle of attack are studied. The intake performance is assessed using the total pressure recovery, mass flow ratio, flow distortion, and bleed mass flow ratio. The results show that applying the bleed at a position near the intake entrance and reducing the bleed entrance slant angle and width all improve the intake performance considerably. Moreover, these parameters postpone the buzz onset. In addition, it is found that the vertical position of the intersection point of the barrier and normal shocks plays an important role in the intake pressure recovery.",31,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35421,"Numerical investigation of oscillations in nonequilibrium two-phase flows with a model for homogeneous nucleation in Laval nozzles is presented. The model, implemented within an Eulerian–Eulerian reference frame, is formulated using classical nucleation theory. Results by two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods are presented and compared, showing the accuracy of the predicted frequency and the pressure amplitude by a two-dimensional method. Emphasis is placed on oscillating flows in a variety of nozzle geometries, covering a range of inlet conditions. Dependences of frequency on inlet stagnation subcooling demonstrate that the occurrence of the asymmetric mode for pure steam flow is not exclusive to a specific nozzle geometry and inlet condition, which could be deferred by increasing the expansion rate and decreasing the inlet pressure.",31,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34804,"The present paper demonstrates the aerodynamic feasibility of boundary-layer ingesting embedded-engine inlet designs with low total pressure losses and distortion harmonic content. The inlet was designed using a hierarchical multi-objective computational fluid dynamics optimization that combined global and local shaping. Global parameters including duct offset and length, wall curvature and shape, inlet aspect ratio, lip contour and thickness, and upstream airframe contour were used to identify optimal design space regions. Local inlet shaping optimization further reduced total pressure losses and harmonic distortion upstream of the fan. Coupled inlet/fan design iterations were carried out for selected inlet designs to assess the fan/engine stability and operability benefits. The resulting inlet design has the potential of achieving a 3–5% boundary-layer ingesting fuel burn benefit for NASA’s Generation-After-Next aircraft relative to a baseline high-performance pylon-mounted propulsion system. It shows significantly improved performance when compared with NASA’s “inlet A” reference geometry with a length-to-diameter ratio of 3. The new inlet was shortened to a length-to-diameter ratio of 0.6, total pressure losses were reduced by three times, dominant distortion harmonic amplitudes were reduced by 30–50%, and fan efficiency losses were reduced from 6 to 0.5–1.5%. No flow control was required.",31,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35381,"Mature gas turbine performance simulation technology has been developed in the past decades and, therefore, gas turbine performance at different ambient and operating conditions can be well predicted if good thermodynamic performance software and necessary engine performance information are available. However, the performance of gas turbine engines of the same fleet may be slightly different from engine to engine due to manufacturing and assembly tolerance and may change over time due to engine degradation. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and track important performance parameters of gas turbine engines, particularly those that cannot be directly measured, to ensure safe operation of the engines. For that reason, a novel gas turbine performance estimation method using engine gas path measurements has been developed to predict and track engine performance parameters at different ambient, flight, degraded, and part-load operating conditions. The method is based on the influence coefficient matrix of thermodynamic performance parameters of gas turbine engines and the Newton–Raphson mathematical algorithm. Contrary to the conventional gas turbine off-design performance predictions where component characteristic maps are essential, it has the advantage that no component characteristic maps are required for the predictions and, therefore, it is relatively simple thermodynamically, fast in calculation, and desirable in engineering applications. It is able to make important invisible performance parameters visible to gas turbine users, which is a useful complement to current engine condition monitoring techniques. The developed method was applied to the performance prediction of a model gas turbine engine similar to EJ200 low-bypass turbofan engine running at different altitudes, Mach numbers, and part load, with and without degradation, by using simulated gas path measurements to test the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the method is able to predict the engine performance with good accuracy without the consideration of measurement noise and with slightly lower accuracy when measurement noise is included. It takes about 30 s for a typical prediction point, which is suitable for offline performance tracking and condition monitoring. Theoretically, the method can be applied to the performance estimation of any types of gas turbine engines.",31,3

The scalar mixing and combustion is modeled using a flamelet-based approach for partially premixed combustion. In this approach, transport equations to describe scalar mixing and reacting fields and their statistical interactions are solved along with standard conservation equations. The boundary conditions are specified using measured values. The computed spatial variations of averaged temperature and dry mole fractions of various scalars, including CO and NOx, compared quite well with measured values. The results of this combustion model are compared with the eddy-dissipation-concept model commonly used for gas turbine combustion calculation and this comparison showed that the results of partially premixed combustion model is improved considerably.",31,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35602,"The design of a miniature ramjet combustor using gaseous methane fuel for Mach 2.5 has been conducted. The main challenges stem mainly from the insufficient space for mixing and burning, short residence time, and the flame stabilization. Impossible utilization of relatively large air-blast fuel injectors provides more difficulties for the design. The trapped vortex combustor, as a novel way of flameholding by trapping the pilot flame inside a cavity instead of exposing it to the mainstream, is selected. Three main parts are studied numerically, which include the cold flowfield characteristics, the fuel-injection schemes, and the overall combustion performance. The results show that the drag coefficient can help to determine the optimum cavity size for trapping a stable vortex. Injecting all the fuel in the cavity always leads to an overly fuel-rich condition, whereas injecting in front of the cavity with a momentum flux ratio between 0.61 and 1.0 can successfully achieve stoichiometric mixing in the cavity. However, compared to nonreacting fuel mixing, the combustion performance is found to be more sensitive to the value of . Among the cases studied, the one with a small of about 0.61 has more intense pilot flames and shorter main combustor flames. The effects of angled injection, upstream injection location, and the combustor length based on the found are also investigated.",31,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35530,"For shear coaxial injectors, which are widely used in liquid oxygen–gaseous hydrogen rocket engines, the key parameters that characterize injector geometry are the recess length, taper angle, and wall thickness of the liquid oxygen post, which is the inner tube of the coaxial injector. In the present study, the effects of the recessed length and taper angle of the liquid oxygen post on cryogenic coaxial jets at supercritical pressures were experimentally investigated. The large-scale structure and mixing enhancement of cryogenic nitrogen and gaseous helium coaxial jets were evaluated using a high-speed backlighting technique. Instantaneous backlit images revealed that the dark core, which is believed to be dense nitrogen, exhibited sinusoidal forms induced by the presence of the outer helium jets. However, the sinusoidal oscillations were less influenced by the injector geometry. The mixing enhancement of coaxial jets was evaluated with respect to the dark-core length and the jet spread angle. The recessed liquid oxygen post enhanced the mixing of cryogenic nitrogen when the recess length was sufficiently large, which suggests that a recess of a certain length is required to improve the mixing of cryogenic coaxial jets at supercritical pressures. Because the decrease in the dark-core length with the recessed length was consistent with the increase in the jet spread angle at the injector exit, the mixing enhancement caused by the recess can be regarded as a result of an improvement in the mixing between the inner and outer jets in the recessed region. The effects of the liquid oxygen post exit taper on the mixing enhancement were more significant than those of the recess. The decrease in the dark-core length with the inner-to-outer momentum flux ratio ( number) is consistent with the relevant empirical correlation at supercritical pressures. Therefore, the mixing enhancement caused by the liquid oxygen post exit taper can be considered the result of an increase in the number, rather than the result of giving azimuthal velocity to the cryogenic nitrogen jet at the liquid oxygen post exit.",31,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35527,"Ignition temperatures of non-premixed flames of ethylene/-dodecane blends were measured and modeled in the counterflow configuration at atmospheric pressure and an unburned fuel-carrying stream temperature of 453 K. Ethylene is an important product of the thermal decomposition of large molecular weight -alkanes such as -dodecane that produces ethylene via scission. Thermal decomposition is expected in scramjet applications in which the fuel is also used as the vehicle and engine coolant. Thus, the ignition process of the mixtures of the parent molecule and products of decomposition could be among the controlling factors of operation in hypersonic propulsion. In the present study, laser Doppler velocimetry was used to measure local strain rates and thermocouples were used to measure ignition temperatures. Simulations of the experiments were performed using four kinetic models, and comparisons were made against the experimental data. Notable discrepancies were found between the data and the predictions, as well among the predicted ignition temperatures. Through sensitivity and reaction path analyses, insight was gained into the physicochemical couplings during the ignition of binary fuel flames, and the sources of the discrepancies were identified to be of both kinetic and molecular transport natures. It was determined that there is an interesting kinetic coupling between these two fuels at the ignition state, given that, upon blending, ethylene acts as both a fuel and an intermediate of the decomposition of -dodecane.",31,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35378,"A hot-air film-heating method designed for the anti-icing system of a small aeroengine cone is studied as well as an experimental study on its performance. Experiments are conducted under different icing conditions and hot air parameters in an icing wind tunnel, using a full-scale experimental cone model of a small aeroengine. The temperature distributions on the cone surface are measured by thermocouples. Experiment results show that the hot-air film anti-icing method is effective for the cone leading edge. Also presented is a numerical simulation of the temperature distribution of the aeroengine cone under icing condition. The flowfield around the cone is obtained by computational-fluid-dynamics code. The trajectories of supercooled water droplets and the collection efficiency are calculated by the Lagrangian approach. The coupling effects of heat transfer and mass transfer are considered in the temperature computation of the cone. The thermal analysis model considers the mass balance of water and energy balance on the surface of the cone. The simulation results are compared to the experiment measurements. The characteristics of the hot-air film-heating anti-icing method are also discussed.",31,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35310,"Adverse effects of phosphate ions used as a stabilizing agent in rocket-grade hydrogen peroxide on the decomposition catalyst were investigated. For a comparative study, and were selected as the catalyst to decompose 90 wt% hydrogen peroxide containing of phosphate ions. The reactivity of the catalysts measured by reactivity tests decreased by half in the hydrogen peroxide, including phosphate ions. Endurance of the catalyst was evaluated on a 50 N monopropellant thruster by measuring the chamber pressure. The degradation of the decomposition efficiency of the catalyst was evident after the initial 5 s, during which the lead-doped catalyst revealed better performance than the pure catalyst. After 30 s of thruster operation, performance degradation was particularly severe with the lead-doped catalyst. The catalysts sampled after thruster operation were characterized by mass analysis, the Brunauer Emmet Teller model, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. A large quantity of phosphorus was detected on both catalysts tested with a high concentration of phosphate ions. The amount of phosphorus detected on the lead-doped catalyst was four times as large as the amount of phosphorus on the pure catalyst, indicating the affinity of lead and phosphate. The accumulation of phosphate on the catalyst surface inhibited the contact of hydrogen peroxide and the active material, preventing efficient decomposition.",31,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35467,"The present work is aimed at studying the fracture behavior of a hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene solid rocket propellant. A fracture mechanics method based on the integral was adopted to evaluate the material’s resistance against crack initiation and propagation with the auxiliary of a high-speed microscopic camera and multiple-sample test procedure. The discrete data of load, displacement, and fracture energy at different crack initiation points and crack growth amounts were well fitted by the least-squares method and binomial method. The crack initiation integral was determined, and the apparent initiation fracture toughness was obtained by the blunting line and curve. Furthermore, a crack-propagation velocity curve was obtained, and the damage mechanism of the crack-tip zone and its influence on the crack propagation were investigated.",31,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35587,"Numerical simulations of the flowfield in a gaseous oxygen/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene hybrid rocket engine are carried out with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver including detailed gas/surface interaction modeling based on surface mass and energy balances. Fuel pyrolysis is modeled via finite-rate Arrhenius kinetics. A simplified two-step global reaction mechanism is considered for the gas-phase chemistry to model the combustion of 1,3-butadiene in oxygen. Results are compared with the firing test data obtained from a laboratory-scale hybrid rocket in which gaseous oxygen is fed into axisymmetric hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene cylindrical grains through an axial conical subsonic nozzle. With the oxidizer fed by this injector, which generates nonuniform conditions at the entrance of the fuel port, the fuel regression rate is shown to increase several times with respect to the case of homogeneous injection of the oxidizer through all the grain port area, in agreement with the experimental findings. The spatial distribution of the regression rate is substantially different from the one expected in a turbulent developing flow through a pipe because of the presence of a strong recirculation zone at the motor head end. Numerical simulations, although not capturing the absolute regression-rate values, are fairly able to predict the main ballistic features: that is, the regression rate’s weaker dependence on the mass flux, the influence of port diameter, and the pressure evolution over time, as well as the general trends of different firing tests.",31,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35480,"This study investigates the flame spreading and combustion modes of a novel axial-injection end-burning hybrid rocket motor. A motor structure is designed, and experiments are conducted with both polymethyl methacrylate and polyethylene fuels. Gaseous oxygen is used as the oxidizer in the tests. Different fuel duct diameters, fuel duct numbers, and nozzle throat diameters are combined to get different oxygen velocities. Three kinds of combustion modes are observed in the tests, end burning, opposed propagating, and side burning, which are divided by two transition oxygen velocities. The ranges of the transition velocities are obtained by experiments. According to the results, end burning occurs when the oxygen velocity is above the transition velocity B; side burning occurs when the oxygen velocity is below the transition velocity A; and opposed propagating takes place when the oxygen velocity is between the two transition velocities. In addition, the experiments reveal that the fuel regression rate of the end-burning hybrid rocket motor is much lower than that of the conventional side-burning hybrid rocket motor. The success of the firing tests verifies the probability of the motor scheme and provides foundations for the development of this novel hybrid rocket motor.",31,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35539,"Combustion instabilities are a common difficulty in the design of combustion systems for applications from power generation gas turbines to gas and liquid fuel rockets. Many low-order models have been developed for quick turnaround prediction of trends, while high-fidelity, large-eddy simulations are becoming a viable tool with the increasing availability of computing resources. In this paper, a three-dimensional linear thermoacoustic solver is developed to fill the void in design tools between the low-order modeling techniques and the expensive high-fidelity approach. The solver uses the finite volume method with a second-order Riemann solver flux calculation to solve the linearized Euler equations with unsteady heat release. The code is written for unstructured grids in order to easily accommodate the complex geometries of industrial combustors. Because the application requires the ability to resolve the effects of sharp gradients of mean density, a method for treating variable-coefficient hyperbolic systems is developed within the Riemann solver approach for unstructured grids. The code is tested with three verification cases with comparison to exact solution and three validation cases with comparison to experimental data. The code is shown to predict the frequencies and limit-cycle amplitudes of the validation experiments well, comparing favorably to lower-order models. In the final validation case, the code predicts the frequency and limit-cycle amplitude within 5% for a realistic gas turbine combustor design. More important, the code predicts the subsequent stability of the mode after a change in the operating conditions.",31,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35393,"The paper deals with three nonideal effects, often neglected in the literature, which affect the current and potential profiles along a bare electrodynamic tether. The first appears when the size of the tether cross-section width is large enough to have potential barriers for the probe radius in the radial effective potential energy of the plasma electrons. The tether is not able to capture the orbital-motion-limited current law and is said to operate beyond the orbital-motion-limited regime. It is shown that this effect can be accurately modeled by just scaling the tether characteristic length according to a dimensionless factor depending on tether and plasma properties. The high-bias approximation in the orbital-motion-limited current collection law, normally assumed in past work, is discussed. The third effect becomes relevant when the cathodic plasma contactor potential drop is nonnegligible compared with the product of the tether length and the motional electric field. Numerical simulations performed with a newly developed tether flight simulator across a wide range of mission scenarios and design parameters shows that the first effect can be safely ignored for preliminary tether mission design. The cathodic plasma contactor potential drop, however, increases the deorbit time of kilometer-length tethers in a nonnegligible way. In the extreme case in which the tether is less than a few hundred meters long, such an effect would strongly deteriorate its deorbit performance.",31,3

By applying a pulsating drive voltage with a frequency close to that of the discharge oscillation, the stable and synchronized operation of a Hall thruster can be realized. A pulsating boost chopper circuit is also proposed that is suitable for use as a pulse-synchronous drive and has many attractive features as the driver circuit for Hall thrusters. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the thrust performance is improved approximately 30% at 200 W input power by using the driver circuit.
