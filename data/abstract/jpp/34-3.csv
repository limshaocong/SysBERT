The large vibration amplitudes of individual blades inherent in mistuned blisks reduces the high cycle fatigue margin significantly. It is therefore important to perform mistuning analyses at a high accuracy while keeping the computational cost at an acceptable level. Because numerous analyses with large amount of degrees of freedom models are commonly performed, it is frequent to employ reduced-order models such as to reduce the computational effort. In this paper, a unique way to address the reduced-order model is presented, where each blisk sector is attached as individual substructures with the free-interface approach known as Craig–Chang. This implementation is compared against a fixed-interface approach known as Craig–Bampton in terms of accuracy for disk- and blade-dominated modes. Neither of these approaches applies cyclic symmetry, making them more accurate in the presence of mistuning when the harmonic patterns are destroyed. Results show the high benefits of using the free-interface approach for a mistuned forced response analysis.",34,3

Additionally, in high-Mach-number scramjets fueled with wall-based injectors, delivering fuel to engine centerline air is challenging, typically relying on turbulent mixing through long combustors. This study exploits the interaction between the density-stratified flow and the vortices generated by a strategically positioned injector in the inlet to manipulate the flow field, redistributing oxygen in captured air to more accessible locations. A numerical study was performed, examining the Mach 12 rectangular-to-elliptical shape-transitioning engine flow path. With the inlet compressing air into a high-density cowl-side core-flow, hydrogen injection here through a “manipulator jet” imparts vorticity through the bulk of the engine mass flow. This high-penetration injector allowed hydrogen to pierce the core-flow, aided by the engine’s natural shock train. The injector-induced vortices ensured that centrally located and previously inaccessible air was redistributed to the more accessible cowl-side combustor surface. When combined with supplementary injectors, combustion efficiencies exceeding 80% were achievable 3.6 combustor-heights further upstream than with previous fueling configurations. These improved mixing and combustion rates suggest that combustor length could be reduced in future studies.",34,3

The gas generator should supply product gas with an oxygen concentration of 21 mol % at a given pressure of 3–12 bar and a temperature near 500°C, which are the flow conditions in a ramjet combustor flying at Mach 3. To avoid detonation of the liquid monopropellant, an appropriate mixture ratio of hydrogen peroxide, water, and ethanol was selected. In the batch reactor test, the tested catalysts were manganese oxide and platinum with gamma-alumina pellets. The temperature measurements indicated that the platinum with alumina pellets was more appropriate for decomposing propellant than manganese oxide with alumina pellets. In addition, product gas species with an oxygen concentration of 21 mol % were confirmed through the test. In the demonstration test, the system was operated with a propellant mass flow rate near 100 g/s. A catalytic reaction was sustained for the whole operation time with an adiabatic decomposition temperature efficiency of over 0.98. The measured flow temperature was near 500°C and the chamber pressure was near 5.5 bar, which satisfied the flow conditions in a ramjet combustor flying at Mach 3.",34,3

Aluminum plates are placed adjacent to, but electrically isolated from, the facility walls downstream along thruster centerline and radially outward, centered on the exit plane. Data are acquired for four plate electrical configurations: 1) biased relative to ground with measurements of collected current, 2) grounded with measurements of currents to ground, 3) floating with measurements of floating voltages, and 4) connected with measurements of the current conducted between the plates. The 42% decrease in ion beam current associated with krypton operation resulted in a 58 and 19% decrease in the collected current to ground and floating voltage, respectively, of the axial plate; the 10% increase in divergence half-angle with krypton propellant yielded a change in sign for the collected current to ground and floating voltage of the radial plate. These findings suggest that changes to the ion current density profile cause concomitant changes to electrical coupling between the Hall effect thruster and test facility.",34,3

The results show that, under the unstart condition, a well-designed splitter could suppress the massive cowl shock-induced separation, increase the fullness of the rampside boundary-layer profile at the isolator exit, and improve the inlet performance over the targeted operating Mach number range. With the splitter design, the severe shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction induced by the strong cowl shock is replaced by several weaker shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions with reduced shock intensity and boundary-layer thickness.",34,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36479,"Computations were performed to understand propulsion tradeoffs that occur when a hypersonic vehicle travels along an ascent trajectory. Operability limits are plotted that define allowable flight corridors on an altitude versus flight Mach number performance map. Two operability limits are set by requirements that combustion efficiency exceeds 0.90 and that flameout be avoided. Ambient gas pressure decreases during ascent, which for a fixed waverider inlet (compressor) design slows finite rate chemistry in the combustor. However, this can be offset by increases in flight Mach number and gas temperature in the combustor. New aspects of the work are that operability limits are computed for a waverider trimmed at each altitude. The University of Michigan–U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory scramjet in vehicle waverider model includes finite rate chemistry, three-dimensional mixing, ram–scram transition, and an empirical value of the flameout Damköhler number. A reduced-order modeling approach is justified (instead of computational fluid dynamics results) because all vehicle forces are computed over 1800 times to generate multidimensional performance maps. Trajectories were optimized to achieve highest combustion efficiency and avoid flameout limits.",34,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36774,"In industrial problems such as combustion instabilities in gas-turbine engines and rockets, noise from piston engines, and cooling by thermoacoustic refrigerators, there is a complex interaction between acoustics and thermohydrodynamic processes. Ideally, one would represent this interaction by resolving as much physics as computer power allows, but this is expensive. On the other hand, the common practice of finding empirical boundary conditions takes extensive calibration. The present work is an attempt to enhance this state of affairs by proposing to model a portion of the duct system of interest with computational fluid dynamic techniques and the rest with three-dimensional linearized conservation laws solved with what is called here a thermoacoustic solver. The modeling error of this hybrid approach is presented for five different tests, including two combustion-instability problems. Furthermore, ways to improve it are discussed.",34,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36289,"In turbofan engine, ice accretion on a spinner cone may lead to a decline in the engine aerodynamic performance and an increase of the vibration amplitude of the engine. The shedding ice debris from the spinner cone may damage fan blades and endanger flying safety. An understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the ice shedding process is necessary to optimize the design of spinner cone and de-icing system to avoid hazardous ice shedding. The combination of ice adhesive and cohesive failure leads to the complexity of the ice shedding from a rotating spinner cone. In this paper, a novel ice shedding model for a spinner cone with consideration of ice cohesive and adhesive failure is proposed. The cohesive zone material model is applied to simulate the initiation and propagation of ice/spinner cone interface crack. The extended finite element method is introduced to model crack growth inside the ice. The ice shedding process from a spinner cone is explained and analyzed by using the combination of cohesive zone material and extended finite element method. Some factors that affect the break-up and shedding of the ice are discussed, which include the mechanical properties of the ice and ice/spinner cone interface. A preliminary validation of this model is carried out through the comparison of numerical results and experimental data. This model can provide useful information for further study on the ice debris trajectory prediction and ice impact analysis.",34,3

The shock-train location was established by the backpressure rise of combustion and actively controlled in a closed-loop fashion by actuating a water-cooled flap just downstream of the flameholder. The control task was to move the shock train to a user-selected location. The shock-train location was controlled using a proportional-derivative controller with real-time feedback of the shock-train location. Three algorithms for shock-train location were investigated: A threshold method that relied on wall-pressure measurements in the isolator, a predictive system identification-based mathematical model of the shock-train location and flap angle, and a predictive system identification-based mathematical model of the shock-train location and isolator pressure ratio. The first two methods were implemented experimentally within the closed-loop, whereas the third was examined through postprocessing. The threshold estimate closed-loop control scheme provided an approximately 3% (isolator length) tracking error; the predictive flap-position and pressure-ratio system identification predictions provided 10 and 7% tracking errors, respectively. All methods of shock-train location estimation could potentially facilitate closed-loop control of the shock train (individually or in parallel), with a tradeoff between the accuracy and information required for the implementation of each.",34,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36723,"To enable better designing of inductively coupled plasma (ICP) cathodes, this study experimentally investigated the ignition and electron emission performances of an ICP cathode as functions of the orifice diameter, shape of the electrode used for ion collection, and total number of coils. Because the plasma ignition in an ICP cathode obeys Paschen’s law, decreasing the orifice diameter enhances the ignition performance. However, excessive orifice narrowing decreases the electron emission current from the cathode. Therefore, an optimum orifice diameter exists that balances the ignition and electron emission performances. In addition, it is preferable for the electrode used for ion collection to have a large slit for electric field penetration to enhance the ignition performance. On the other hand, when the orifice diameter is properly selected, increasing the ion collection area by narrowing the slit improves the electron emission performance. Thus, the electrode shape should be designed to achieve a balance between the plasma ignition and electron emission. Finally, increasing the total number of coils enhances the ignition performance. However, owing to the power loss caused by ohmic heating in the coil, an optimum total number of coils exists that maintains the adequate electron emission performance.",34,3

The components of n-dodecane, 2,5-dimethylhexane, and toluene are chosen to provide comparable molecular sizes and the representative functional groups , , CH, and phenyl of the target fuels. Several important physical properties, including molecular weight, hydrogen/carbon ratio, density, specific heat capacity, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of surrogate fuel, are validated under normal conditions (S-8 and Jet-A) and sub- and supercritical conditions (RP-3). In addition to the detailed comprehensive surrogate chemistry, two skeletal kinetic mechanisms reduced by the path flux analysis scheme are also conducted. The comparisons between the numerical and experimental data, including ignition delay time, flow reactor species profile, and laminar burning velocities, are implemented to elucidate the similarities in the reaction characteristics of surrogates and real fuels. The results show that present surrogate fuels can emulate both the physical and kinetic properties well for these three types of jet fuel.",34,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36646,"To prevent flame flashback in swirl-stabilized, lean premixed combustion, a nonswirling air jet is introduced on the central axis of the radial swirl generator. This axial injection of air alters the flowfield as required for flashback-resistant combustion of premixed hydrogen. This study evaluates the impact of axial injection on the isothermal flowfield in a water tunnel by particle image velocimetry. Atmospheric reacting tests with hydrogen for inlet temperatures up to 620 K and up to stoichiometric conditions show a substantial increase in flashback resistance for the burner setup with axial injection. To verify the increase in flashback resistance to not be achieved at the expense of increased emissions, fuel–air mixing is evaluated in a water tunnel by planar laser-induced fluorescence of a fuel tracer. Even for high axial injection rates, the recorded unmixedness and emissions are uncorrelated. This results in single-digit emissions below adiabatic flame temperatures of 2000 K. Consequently, axial injection significantly extends the operational range of the combustor without increasing the emissions.",34,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36724,"Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the penetration height on the combustion efficiency of a hydrogen peroxide/kerosene bipropellant thruster applied in a kerosene transverse injector. The penetration height of the primary breakup represents the fuel distribution of the kerosene transverse injector. The most significant design parameters of a kerosene transverse injector from a combustion efficiency perspective were assumed to be the fuel distribution and droplet size after secondary breakup. Therefore, kerosene transverse injectors were designed using three different penetration heights and a unified mean droplet size. Autoignition was stably achieved, and the hydrogen peroxide was fully decomposed for all hot-fire cases. The optimum combustion efficiency was expected for a penetration height between 44.0 and 72.4% of the inner radius of the kerosene transverse injector. The sensitivity of the variation in the combustion efficiency diminished as the penetration height increased, owing to the surface breakup of the liquid column.",34,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36366,"A detailed study concerning a novel, dynamic control strategy for mitigating thermoacoustic instability in a swirl-stabilized lean premixed, laboratory combustor configuration is presented in this paper. The mitigation strategy is realized by rotating the otherwise static swirler, which is primarily meant for stabilizing the lean premixed flame. The proposed strategy is tested over a range of bulk flow velocities, mixture equivalence ratios, and swirler rotation rates for validating the robustness of this concept. A prominent reduction in the fundamental acoustic mode amplitude by about 25 dB is observed with this control technique for the cases that are studied. The physical mechanism responsible for the instability mitigation due to the rotating swirler is investigated by observing the distinct changes associated with the reacting flowfield using particle image velocimetry. An attempt is made to probe into the self-excited flame dynamics using high-speed intensified, chemiluminescence imaging and identifying the instability driving source locations from a spatial Rayleigh indices map. The rotating swirler induces vortex breakdown and increased turbulence intensity to decimate strongly positive Rayleigh indices regions (and eventually the acoustic energy source) to render quiet instability mitigated swirling flames.",34,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36429,"This paper presents a computational model for axial compressor stall inception and its nonlinear evolution using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations as an initial boundary value problem. The initial disturbance with the most unstable mode is obtained by a stall inception eigenvalue approach. To validate this computational model, several unsteady inlet boundary conditions with different frequencies are used as initial perturbations for full-annulus unsteady simulations of a transonic compressor rotor flow. Results reveal that the disturbance with the frequency near the most unstable mode can stimulate the objective rotating stall behavior, whereas the disturbances with the frequencies further away from the former cannot. The flow mechanism of rotating stall in a typical stalled case is also analyzed. It is found that severe tip clearance spillage and backflow form the stall inception disturbance, accompanied by a typical spike-type precursor. Based on comparison and analysis for different simulation examples, the present computational model provides a fast and reliable route to implement nonlinear simulation of compressor rotating stall.",34,3

Using multiple streamwise displaced microphones, the integrated exhaust velocity and static temperature were measured simultaneously in engine flows with bypass Mach numbers up to 0.48. A Kiel pressure and K-type thermocouple probe was used to assess the accuracy of the acoustic measurements. The Integrated velocity and static temperature rms errors of and 2.3 K were identified. Using probe-based measurements at a low engine power setting, two calibration constants were identified for conversion from integrated flow parameters to mass flow and thrust. Applying the calibration constants to the acoustic measurements, and 200 N rms errors in mass flow and thrust were observed. These promising results indicate that the acoustic technique may be used to characterize and monitor gas-turbine engine performance.

16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36605,"Particle image velocimetry was performed in the spanwise centerplane of a scramjet cavity flameholder under premixed hydrocarbon-fueled dual-mode conditions, providing the first reported results of their kind. Graphite tracer particles were shown to offer suitable aerodynamic performance and durability in a high-enthalpy flow, overcoming restrictions on measurement duration due to window degradation by metal oxide tracers used in prior investigations. A precombustion shock system was recreated, independent of heat release, through use of an air throttle, allowing the effects of combustion to be decoupled from upstream aerodynamics. The mean velocity field was found to be affected more by the configuration of the shock system than the presence or amount of heat release. The velocity variance and the strength of the turbulent eddies were also a strong function of shock system configuration under adiabatic conditions, but they took reduced levels once combustion was established and were nearly invariant with subsequent changes to the fueling rate and shock system. A comparison of turbulent velocities with planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging of the Hydroxyl radical indicated main-duct combustion was piloted by the intermittent transport through the shear layer of products generated in the cavity interior.",34,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36779,"This paper has the objective of addressing a few basic issues pertaining to the use of the laminar flamelet method to model turbulence-combustion interactions in supersonic combustion. Specifically, this paper documents the way in which the use of Troe’s pressure-reaction-rate model affects the laminar flame solutions that are used in the generation of the flamelet library for supersonic combustion. For the opposed-jet model of nonpremixed flames, this study also investigates how the laminar-flamelet results obtained using the flamelet equations differ from those obtained from the canonical equations for opposed-jet flame (OJF). The differential results obtained for supersonic combustion predictions in two models of the scramjet isolator/combustor when pressure, in several formulations, is included as an independent variable of the flamelet table are also presented. Lastly, this study investigates the manner in which the use of various interpolations of the reaction progress variable from the S-curve affects turbulent supersonic combustion results. The overall goal of the various studies is to provide an improved flamelet modeling of supersonic combustion. Simulations based on linear progress variable interpolation coupled with the seven-level pressure field in the base flamelet library, using the OJF equations, appear to yield the best results.",34,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36621,"Shock-wave propagation around a microwave-rocket nozzle was numerically reproduced using a computational fluid dynamics code when an electron cyclotron resonance condition was satisfied by irradiating 25 GHz microwaves onto the rocket nozzle under an external magnetic field. The pulse-duration and nozzle-shape dependence for the thrust performance of the microwave rocket was evaluated by changing the normalized heating length and the normalized nozzle radius. The open-front approach using a butterfly valve was newly proposed to improve the thrust performance by eliminating the negative thrust and removing the stagnation region during the gas-refilling process. The thruster only received the positive pressure of the shock wave by eliminating the contribution of the negative pressure using the open-front approach, which improved the thrust performance. In addition to the thrust improvement, the gas-refilling performance was also improved because the ambient gas flowed from the open front to the nozzle inside without forming the stagnation region. The improvement of the thrust performance and the gas-refilling performance can improve the payload transportation efficiency and further reduce the cost of launch using beamed-energy propulsion.",34,3

To reduce the computational cost, four versions of skeletal mechanisms (respectively, , , , and ) have been developed for China RP-3 kerosene; and the latest one was used.

20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36315,"Composite reactive material powders combining boron with 40 mass % of magnesium are prepared by mechanical milling of elemental boron and magnesium powders. Commercial boron is washed with acetonitrile to remove surface boron oxide, which can react with magnesium during milling. Thermogravimetric measurements showed two oxidation steps. X-ray diffraction analysis of partially oxidized samples showed that selective oxidation of magnesium occurred during the first step. It was followed by oxidation of boron during the second step. Prepared composite powders were ignited using an electrically heated filament, by electric spark, and in constant-volume explosion tests. Ignition is caused by selective oxidation of magnesium. Ignition temperature of the composite powders obtained in heated filament tests was lower than that measured for the pure magnesium. A faster initiation by electric spark was observed for powders prepared using washed boron. This was attributed to an increased effect of heterogeneous oxidation for high heating rates and thus to an accelerated heterogeneous oxidation for powders achieved after removal of the natural boron oxide and hydroxide surface layers. Following the ignition, boron continued to react, contributing to the released combustion heat and pressure generated by the flame in both constant-volume explosion and spark ignition tests.",34,3

The focus of the present paper was to further demonstrate the increased effectiveness of the in situ synthesis method for titania catalysts and to assess the manufacturing, safety, and temperature sensitivity of the resulting composite propellants. Burning rate increases as high as 69% at additive mass loadings of only 0.3% were observed in nonaluminized propellants for pressures from 3.5 to 15.5 MPa. Increases in burning rate up to 73% were seen in aluminized propellants. To test the temperature sensitivity, the propellants were cooled to 245 K and heated to 360 K before testing. The results, on average, showed that the titania addition increased the temperature sensitivity of the propellant. Cook-off safety tests showed that the titania nano-additives lowered the safety margin, but by no more than 20°C at the extreme. This paper documents the authors’ latest techniques for producing propellants with nanosized additives with and without aluminum and provides new burning rate results for the entire scope of additives and mixing methods, including the temperature sensitivity of the propellants containing nanotitania.",34,3
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36617,"Tip leakage significantly affects the axial-compressor performance (i.e., its pressure ratio, peak efficiency, and surge margin). The size of the clearance is one of the most important parameters in compressor design. Generally, the tip clearance is uniform from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the compressor-blade section at the tip. In this paper, the effect of chordwise nonuniform tip clearance on the axial-compressor performance is investigated. In addition, the optimum distribution of clearance size is obtained by employing a surrogate model in conjunction with a multi-objective genetic algorithm for optimization. It is shown that the nonuniform tip clearance can effectively reduce the leakage mass-flow rate and eliminate the flow separation, thus enhancing the overall performance of the compressor. Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis, it is found that the changes in clearance size near the trailing edge of the blade tip contribute more toward the improvement of the compressor efficiency than those obtained by changing the clearance near the leading edge. The Pareto optimal front obtained by employing the multi-objective genetic algorithm shows that the transonic axial compressor with well-designed distributions of tip-clearance size gives 0.64% improvement in peak efficiency and 48.18% enhancement in surge margin.",34,3
