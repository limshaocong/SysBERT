0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37419,"This work presents the modeling, control design, and simulation of a Cirrus SR20 with a hybrid electric propulsion (HEP) system composed of a combustion engine and battery-supplied electric drive that operates in one of two modes: 1) battery discharging and electric drive propelling, and 2) battery charging and electric drive generating. Given a supervisory-level system model, two optimization control problems are developed. The first finds the elevator deflection and propeller shaft power and speed that minimizes the desired flight profile tracking error. The second manages HEP power flows to provide the desired propeller shaft power while trading off fuel use and battery charge level deviation. The second optimal control problem is a switched problem that requires optimization over discrete and continuous control inputs. The problem is solved using an embedding method that relaxes the discrete valued inputs to continuous values to avoid computational complexity associated with alternate approaches. The resulting model predictive control is demonstrated with simulation of two flight profiles: sawtooth-shaped altitude profile while maintaining constant velocity and an experimental one taken from a production aircraft. Simulations show good profile tracking and appropriate power management. The HEP-equipped aircraft demonstrates a 15.6% fuel savings over the experimental profile; further, the proposed control achieves a 4.3% savings over a rule-based approach under certain conditions.",36,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37740,"A natural-gas-fueled rotating detonation engine was operated at flow conditions typical of gas turbine engines. High-speed broadband chemiluminescence images, particle image velocimetry (PIV), and dynamic pressure measurements were used to characterize the combustion process. A parametric survey was performed with variations of reactant mass flux (, inlet air temperature (520–710 K), equivalence ratio (0.6–1.7), and degree of oxygen enrichment of the oxidizer stream (23.2–33.5% oxygen mass fraction). Robust detonative behavior was observed over a range of parameters with highest pressure fluctuation amplitudes observed with oxygen enrichment of 26–32% and mass flux of . A detailed discussion of two representative cases is presented: one operating with a single rotating wave and another with two corotating waves. In both cases, a minor wave was also detected, which circumscribed the annulus in the reverse direction of the major wave(s). PIV was performed at 100 kHz immediately downstream of the combustor exit. These measurements indicate predominantly axial flow from the exit nozzle, with strong velocity fluctuations corresponding to the detonation precession. Singular spectrum analysis revealed that fluctuations in the axial and azimuthal velocity components remained in-phase, with frequency content that matches the chemiluminescence and pressure signals.",36,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37555,"This study is focused on the morphology of a quasi-DC discharge generated concurrently with a jet of fuel injected normally into Mach 2 crossflow. It was observed that the filamentary plasma follows the local flowfield and localizes in the shear layer between the core flow and fuel jet. The details of behavior were explored by means of stereoscopic two-dimensional imaging with subsequent image processing and three-dimensional reconstruction of the plasma filament shape. On average, the plasma filament generated by the plasma-injection module has a total length over 100 mm and a plasma power on the order of 5 kW with a typical duration of 100 ms. Specifically, the discharge is located in a mixing layer, where the fuel–oxidizer ratio varies from down to stoichiometric ratio further downstream. Such a behavior of filamentary plasma promotes the fuel–air mixing, and is favorable for fuel ignition and flameholding. Tests were performed in the SBR-50 supersonic wind tunnel at the University of Notre Dame.",36,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37695,"Wake ingestion has been studied in order to develop a physics-based understanding of its effect on engine power and propulsive efficiency. A combination of analysis and testing has been employed. A control volume analysis of the one-dimensional flow through an actuator disk has been used to derive a set of equations for the power and propulsive efficiency of a propeller ingesting a wake. This analysis shows that wake ingestion reduces both the power available from the exhaust jet and the useful thrust power of the propeller. The net effect is predicted to be a reduction in the propulsive efficiency, defined as the ratio of the useful power to the power available. A simple experiment was performed to test this prediction. Wake and jet velocity profiles were measured for a series of bodies with thrusts equal to their different drags. These were used to calculate the propulsive efficiency. It is concluded that, although the propulsive efficiency is reduced by wake ingestion, the range of the aircraft is increased.",36,4

In addition, staging can be used to provide redundancy in the propulsion system, counteract thruster degradation, or open up new avenues of mission optimization. Analytical approximations are developed in order to provide a computationally simple approach to the design, analysis, definition of propulsion technology requirements, and online autonomous decision making for systems that make use of staging of propulsion elements. In addition, the analytical approximations provide insight into the dependencies of performance metrics on system parameters. Equations are developed for any mission, defined by its , and then specialized for escape trajectories.",36,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37603,"This paper describes a metal plasma thruster (MPT) that is suited to nano- and microsatellites. The MPT uses solid metal propellant (hence requires no liquids, gases, flow valves, or flow controls), has no moving parts, generates approximately , and may be packaged into , 1-U, and multiple-U increments. A vacuum arc generates a metal plasma plume that accelerates into space at (platinum, Pt) to (magnesium, Mg) to generate thrust . The range of specific impulse is from 693 s (Pt) up to 3119 s (Mg). Spacecraft interface is simple: the autonomous MPT requires only a DC input (7–28 V) and a start/stop control pulse from the satellite. The MPT is simpler and more rugged than ion engines and Hall thrusters, which are not easily scaled down in mass and power for satellites, and provides superior total impulse per kilogram. The MPT is easier to operate than equivalent-sized alternatives: field emission electric propulsion thruster, xenon gas radiofrequency thruster, and pulsed plasma thruster.",36,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37713,"This paper studies the effect of internozzle spacing on the lean blow-off of a linear combustor array. The combustor’s lean operability limit did not have a monotonic relationship with internozzle spacing; the configuration with the intermediate nozzle spacing was the most stable. Simultaneous multi-kHz repetition-rate OH planar laser–induced fluorescence (OH-PLIF) and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (S-PIV) measurements were used to examine the fluid and flame kinematics during the transient blow-off process. Although the blow-off process of any individual nozzle—wherein local extinction led to mixing of cold fluid into the central recirculation zone (CRZ), leading to further extinction—was similar regardless of the internozzle spacing, the presence of adjacent flames influenced both the global and local kinematics. Cross-nozzle flame transport through convection of burning fluid was found to help stabilize the flames in the multinozzle configurations, but could not explain the improved stability of the intermediate spacing case. Furthermore, the intermediate spacing configuration was able to sustain attached flames with greater fluid dynamic strain rate than the other configurations, indicating that it was more resistant to local extinction, ultimately leading to total blow-off. The configuration with the intermediate nozzle spacing had the largest CRZ. A Damköhler number based on the CRZ axial length and bulk velocity at blow-off was relatively constant across the configurations, indicating that a large CRZ provides robustness against the blow-off process. These results demonstrate the complex interplay between fluid dynamics, geometry, and stability of combustion systems.",36,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37566,"Subnanosecond laser ablation of asteroid simulants has been studied, and direct force measurements were made. A 0.7 ns pulsed laser was used, with a 40 kHz pulse repetition frequency, 1064 nm wavelength, and 33 W average power. High-fidelity simulants for carbonaceous chondrite meteorites of types CM, CR, and CI, as well as pyroxene rock and 6061 aluminum were ablated. The force response over 500 ms of ablation was measured using a load cell. In addition, the samples were weighed before and after ablation to determine the mass removal rate. Based on these measurements, the momentum coupling coefficient, specific impulse, and ablation efficiency were calculated. The asteroid analog materials were found to have a modestly higher momentum coupling coefficient than aluminum, although the specific impulse and efficiency were much lower. For asteroid mitigation missions, the asteroid itself is used as the propellant, and so a low specific impulse poses no problem.",36,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37771,"Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of hydrogen injection through a multi-porthole injector array into a Mach 10 enthalpy supersonic crossflow are presented and compared to experimental data. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations using a Menter shear-stress transport turbulence model are performed with the CFD code CFD++. The experimental results showed transient flow behavior in the boundary-layer separation upstream of the injector past the measurable test time. This complicated the validation process of the steady-state simulations to the experimental data. A hybrid simulation, which provides a laminar inflow boundary layer and turbulence production at the injector, matched the upstream separation length as measured from the experimental data. The simulation near-field shock structures and fuel penetration matched experimental schlieren photographs. The close jet-to-jet spacing leads to a blockage of injector-generated vortices. The simulations show that including three-dimensional spillage effects reduced the injection-induced separation length by 20%, and they resulted in a better match with the experimental data. The results also showed the injection-induced separation has a significant spanwise flow and alters the mixing process downstream of the multi-porthole injector array by enabling trailoff vortices to develop.",36,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37315,"Iodine has the potential to be a mission-enabling propellant for electric propulsion; however, iodine as the working gas in a hollow cathode presents many challenges. Iodine propellant was compared with a typical propellant, xenon, in both cathode operation and plume properties. In this work, a low-current barium oxide hollow cathode was operated on xenon and iodine propellants. Its discharge current and voltage, and plume properties in the near-keeper region are reported for xenon and iodine with the cathode at similar operating conditions for each. The cathode operating on iodine required higher power for ignition and discharge maintenance compared with xenon, as evidenced by higher keeper and anode potentials. Plasma properties in the near-keeper region were measured using an emissive probe and single Langmuir probe. For both propellants, the plasma density, electron energy distribution function, electron temperature, select reaction rate coefficients, and time-resolved plasma potentials are reported. For both propellants, the cathode operated the same keeper (0.25 A) and discharge current (3.1 A), but the keeper and anode potentials were higher with iodine: 27 and 51 V for xenon, and 30 and 65 V for iodine, respectively. For both propellants, the electron distribution was best represented by a drifting Maxwellian, characterized by an electron temperature and drift energy. For xenon, the mean electron energy and electron temperature were 7.5 and 0.7 eV, with bulk drift energy of 6.6 eV. For iodine, the mean electron energy and electron temperature were 6.3 and 1.3 eV, with bulk energy of 4.2 eV. A literature review of relevant collisional processes and associated cross sections for an iodine plasma is also presented.",36,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37726,"A low-cost and reliable propellant flow controller is necessary to offer competitive electric propulsion systems. This paper first reviews xenon flow control methods for Hall thrusters and ion engines. Through a trade study, a simple and low-cost xenon flow controller applying a heated capillary is proposed. The test article is fabricated based on a developed theory and tested with xenon. The estimation based on laminar flow shows slightly different characteristics from those of the experiment, although the Reynolds number indicates a laminar condition. The turbulent flow assumption is in good agreement with the experiment at a high mass flow rate while the flow characteristics are between laminar and turbulent at a low mass flow rate. That implies that the surface roughness and tube curvature induce the laminar–turbulent transition even in the low mass flow rate case. To obtain a wider flow rate range, maintaining laminar flow in the capillary is desirable because of the high sensitivity of the friction coefficient with temperature in the laminar flow. Component improvements achievable through miniaturization and reduction of the inner wall surface roughness and capillary curvature are considered to be necessary to prevent the turbulent transition.",36,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37623,"This work provides the design methodology of a radioisotope thermophotovoltaic system (RTPV) using spectral control for space missions. The focus is on the feasibility of a practical system by using two-dimensional micropatterned photonic crystal emitters, selecting the proper thermophotovoltaic cell and insulation material to exclude material incompatibilities, to optimize the system efficiency by impedance matching and to design a radiator with minimum mass. In the last section, a design example is presented based on the tested indium gallium arsenide antimonide (InGaAsSb) cells. It is shown computationally that, in using the experimentally tested InGaAsSb cells, the RTPV generator is expected to reach an efficiency of 8.6% and a specific power of with advanced radiators. Using the more efficient InGaAs cells, the system can expect to triple the figure of merits of the radioisotope thermoelectric generator, promising to reach and , respectively. With a high performance device, the results of this work can lead to a functional prototype for further research focusing on manufacturability and reliability.",36,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37533,"This paper focuses on investigating “combustion instability,” a phenomenon that mainly involves the interaction of the propellant flames with the acoustic oscillations prevalent in full-scale rocket motors. The effect of excited acoustic pressure oscillations on the mean burning rate of solid propellants was estimated over the pressure ranges from 1 to 7 MPa using a window bomb facility coupled with a rotary valve. Both non-aluminized and aluminized composite propellants were used. A rotary valve was used to drive the acoustic oscillations at frequencies of 140, 180 and 240 Hz with the pressure amplitude perturbations ranging from 0.1 to 1.4% of mean chamber pressure. Frequency shift due to propellant combustion was also investigated for both the types of propellants. The acoustic oscillations enhance the heat transfer between the flame and propellant burning surface, altering the mean burning rate. The acoustic pressure oscillations influence the dynamics of aluminum particles and its agglomeration processes, which modifies the mean burning rate. The variations in excited frequencies show a significant impact on the mean burning rate. The burning rate augmentation factor shows that acoustic excitation is more predominant at low pressures and high frequencies, whereas it is relatively marginal at high pressures. The evaluated maximum augmentation factors are 1.45 and 1.51 for nonaluminized and aluminized propellants when compared with those without oscillations.",36,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37719,"Pressure gain combustion (PGC) has gained significant attention in airbreathing gas turbine applications due to its increased thermodynamic efficiency over a constant-pressure Brayton cycle. Rotating detonation engine (RDE) is a form of PGC, and in most RDEs, fuel and oxidizer are injected into the combustion chamber from separate plenums (for safety reasons), leading to an inhomogeneous mixture in the reaction zone. In this paper, a novel approach is developed to model inhomogeneous injection of the fuel–oxidizer mixture in a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics analysis. A probability density function (PDF) of the fuel mass fraction from a converged three-dimensional, nonreacting simulation is extracted and is used as a spatially and temporally varying inlet boundary condition in the two-dimensional simulation. Using this method, a numerical analysis is carried out to predict the flow characteristics, flow structures, and detonation cell size of a non-premixed RDE, using -air as the fuel–oxidizer mixture. The simulation results are validated against experimental results in the literature, and these results from the non-premixed RDE simulations are compared against a perfectly premixed RDE, under same operating conditions. The present study provides a computationally inexpensive method to model RDE injector designs and helps elucidate the effects of inhomogeneous fuel–air mixing on RDEs.",36,4
