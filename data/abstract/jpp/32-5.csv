0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35738,"This paper aims to understand the combined effects of upstream hot streaks and wakes on the blade-to-blade flowfields in a turbine cascade. The computational-fluid-dynamics method was first validated with the unsteady experimental results of the low-speed T106 cascade and then used to study more cases. To simulate the incoming hot streak, a parabolic temperature distribution was applied at the inlet of the computational domain. The incoming wake was simulated using a bar. Four cases with different relative phases between the hot streak and wake were investigated. In different cases, the hot streak and the wake interacted differently, which resulted in a different flowfield in the downstream blade passage. The distributions of the perturbation velocity magnitude and the perturbation velocity vectors were used to explain different convection of the hot streak and the wake. The effects of the transport mechanism on the aerothermal performance of the cascade were discussed. It was found that the time-averaged blade surface pressure distribution and heat flux are similar for the cases studied. However, the fluctuation of the blade surface pressure distribution and heat flux differs significantly as a result of the different transport mechanisms.",32,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35775,"A simplified turbine rim cavity is considered, with a focus on understanding the effects of purge flow swirl on main gas ingestion. Recent work has shown that introducing swirl into purge flow upstream of a blade row is desirable insofar as reducing viscous losses associated with purge flow interaction with the hot-gas path. However, computational fluid dynamics results suggest that, in the presence of the rotating external pressure nonuniformity, due to the downstream blade row, swirled purge flow is less effective in preventing ingestion. This is reflected in higher purge air mass flow rates necessary to seal a given cavity, and that in turn diminishes the positive effect of preswirling purge flow in the first place. It is reasoned that swirled purge flow moves with the rotating pressure nonuniformity and responds to it more readily than nonswirled purge flow, which sees the averaged effect of multiple blade passing events. A flow model based on this physical principle is developed, showing good agreement with computational results. The model yields an ingestion criterion with a parametric dependence on purge flow parameters. The analysis is extended to an unsteady situation, whereby the effects of both stationary and rotating pressure nonuniformities, from vanes and blades, respectively, are taken into account. This unsteady flow model points to an optimal design space, in the context of minimizing purge flow losses while maintaining an appropriate margin with regard to hot-gas ingestion.",32,5

The analysis of fast response measurement data from a 1.5-stage low-pressure axial turbine in the frequency domain shows multiple relevant excitation and noise sources in the flowfield, in addition to the primary rotor–stator interaction. Especially nonsynchronous low-frequency modes at 10% of the blade-passing frequency, occurring in the tip shroud exit cavity, are found to communicate with the main flow and are amplified through the downstream stator row by a flow instability in the interaction area of the passage vortex and boundary layer. Full-annular unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out in addition to the experiments to probe the origin of the cavity modes. They predict the rotor–stator interaction well, but they struggle to resolve low-frequency oscillations in the cavities. Out of the four tested configurations, a shroud trailing-edge cutback is the most efficient option to prevent the formation of the cavity modes. The tradeoff for a low-frequency fluctuation reduction of 12 dB using a trailing-edge partial shroud is a total–total stage efficiency drop of 0.7%.",32,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35522,"This paper presents an experimental and computational study of tip-shroud modifications in a low-pressure gas turbine. Partial shrouds are a viable option to reduce the static stresses in high-speed stages compared to full shrouds while still benefiting from superior aerodynamic efficiency compared to unshrouded blades. Three different tip-shroud platform cutbacks have been tested experimentally in a low-aspect-ratio 1.5-stage low-pressure axial turbine and are compared to a full-shroud baseline. A detailed analysis of the fluid dynamics is carried out to provide a starting point for shroud optimizations. The leading- and trailing-edge platforms are cut back separately to isolate the effect of each modification. The final rotor then features a combined partial shroud on both leading and trailing edge, with the same material reduction as the shroud leading-edge cutback. The time-resolved flowfield and pressure measurements are accompanied by three-dimensional, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations, which provide insight into the over-tip leakage flows and their interaction with the main flow both at cavity inlet and outlet. The aerodynamic losses with the trailing-edge cutback are reduced compared to the baseline, but the resulting underturning from the interaction with the shroud exit cavity makes it inferior in terms of efficiency compared to the leading-edge cutback. The isolated shroud leading-edge cutback shows the best tradeoff between stress reduction and aerodynamic efficiency penalty (0.7%).",32,5

A total of 54 engine firing experiments were conducted between June 2014 and February 2015. Throughout these experiments, the advanced capabilities and functions of this engine, such as wide-range throttling, accurate controllability, and health monitoring, were proved to be feasible. This rocket was also required to be reusable for over 100 flights. To confirm the long-life durability of this engine for over 100 flights in a limited experiment period, sequential multiple-firing tests were planned and conducted. Numerical analysis to evaluate damage of the main chamber due to firings was also conducted.

The enhanced mixing processes are studied numerically to reveal jet mixing enhancement mechanisms. A parametric study has been carried out focusing on the effects of synthetic jet nozzle outlet diameter and maximum blowing jet momentum on penetration depth, interaction area, and counter-rotating vortices pair vorticity. Results show that high-momentum synthetic jets significantly affect the subsonic round jet. The centerline length of the primary jet high-temperature zone is reduced by up to 75% with the presence of synthetic jets. The induced streamwise vortices and the primary jet flapping resulting from synthetic jets are the key mixing mechanism. Jet mixing enhancement is related to the interaction area and the synthetic jet maximum momentum, which is the key parameter in jet mixing.",32,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35846,"Iron oxide and copper chromite have been used as burn-rate modifiers of composite solid propellants. In recent times, studies have been reported on potassium-doped ammonium perchlorate and on dry activated charcoal. These have shown an increase in composite solid propellant burning rates. The studies on composite solid propellants using dry activated charcoal have also shown a reduction in the burn-rate pressure index for a composite solid propellant. With this knowledge, experiments are conducted to develop compositions that result in both high burning rates and low burn-rate pressure index of the propellant. In addition to these, the study also reports propellants with dual burn-rate pressure index. The change in the burn-rate pressure index is from 0.2 to 0.65 in one of the propellants. These could be very useful in that the same grain can act as boost and sustain grain depending on the combustion chamber pressure. With the addition of different burn-rate modifiers, the pressure at which the change in burn-rate pressure index is observed shifts. This could be a very useful tool for propellant designers. It was observed that, with the use of activated charcoal along with potassium-doped ammonium perchlorate, the burn-rate pressure index was brought down from around 0.65 to 0.38, whereas the burn rates were still higher (60%) than the base propellant.",32,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35873,Experimental tests are conducted to evaluate the effect of an annular rocket exhaust pattern on the mixing characteristics of a simple ejector. Rocket exhaust is simulated using pure oxygen while air is entrained from the surroundings at static conditions. Results are compared with an equivalent configuration using traditional circular rocket exhaust nozzles. It is shown that an annular rocket exhaust pattern yields a ratio of entrained air to rocket mass flows over 75% higher than an equivalent circular rocket exhaust pattern over a range of rocket chamber total pressures. It is demonstrated that an annular rocket exhaust pattern within a straight ejector duct with a length-to-diameter ratio of 6 is able to produce entrained air to rocket mass flow ratios up to 10% higher than a straight then expanding ejector configuration twice as long employing a circular rocket exhaust pattern. Exit plane measurements of both total pressure and oxygen concentration are also collected at high and low rocket chamber total pressures. An annular exhaust pattern is shown to yield an average Mach number between 20 and 30% higher than an equivalent configuration using a circular exhaust pattern. Oxygen concentration results indicate that an annular rocket exhaust pattern is better able to mix the entrained air and rocket streams through a more uniform concentration distribution and smaller regions of distinct air and/or rocket species.,32,5

These probes made it possible to perform high-resolution infrared absorption measurements in the narrow region of the evanescent field of the infrared near the probes. The resolution is in the order of the wavelength . Measurements at a wavelength of revealed the profile of gas emitted in the preheated zone, before the flame front.

9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35632,"The self-pulsation characteristics of liquid-centered swirl coaxial injectors have been investigated using a Photron Fastcam SA-1.1 camera and a PULSE system (B&K Corp., 3650 type). The effects of both recess length and injection condition were analyzed and discussed. The flow pattern in the recess chamber of a liquid-centered swirl coaxial injector can be classified into three types, namely, outer, critical, and inner mixing flow. Once the critical flow approaches, self-pulsation is about to occur. When self-pulsation occurs, the spray oscillates with a Christmas tree shape. The Christmas-tree-like spray periodically produces droplet clusters, making horizontal spray width and mass flux oscillate periodically. Self-pulsation is the strongest when the flow is around the critical mixing flow. Both variations of recess length and injection condition can change the flow pattern in the recess chamber. When the flow pattern moves away from the critical mixing flow, self-pulsation is suppressed. All the frequency behaviors of self-pulsation indicate that self-pulsation is strongly related to Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. A possible mechanism of self-pulsation is also presented. This mechanism interprets the experiments of the present study and the results of literature well.",32,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36005,"The trapped vortex combustor concept provides a simple design for flame stabilization by trapping a pilot flame inside a cavity instead of exposing it to the mainstream. Under some circumstances, the combustor may operate in a high-spinning motion (for example, when it is installed in a spin-stabilized ramjet projectile), in which the spinning rate can be as high as 30,000 rpm. The objective of this study is to numerically investigate the effects of high-spinning motion on the trapped vortex combustor, including the cavity vortex dynamics, fuel–air mixing, and combustion performance. Numerical computations have been performed with the Reynolds stress model for turbulence and the eddy dissipation model for combustion in a rotating reference frame. The results of the spinning trapped vortex combustor show that the Coriolis effects dominate the flow in the cavity when it is subjected to a high-spinning motion (30,000 rpm). The vortex breakdown in the cavity brings strong three-dimensional flow and promotes fuel–air mixing so that a stronger cavity pilot flame is generated. But, the effect of the centrifugal force also generates a short recirculation zone in the main combustor and concentrates the fuel stream on the combustor axis, which in turn impairs fuel–air mixing and leads to a longer main combustor flame.",32,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36020,"This paper presents a numerical investigation on the kerosene–air mixture detonation in tubes and the effect of thermal softening on the structural response of the tube of varying thicknesses. The chemical reaction of kerosene–air mixture is modeled by the Arrhenius rate law with an ideal-gas equation of state, and the plastic deformation of the metal tube is described by the Mie–Gruneisen equation of state and Johnson–Cook strength model. To track the multimaterial interface motion and to determine the temperature-varying wall conditions, a hybrid particle-level-set method within the ghost-fluid framework is used. The pulse-detonation loading of metal tube is validated with experimental cell size, and the burst pressure of copper and 304 stainless tubes for varying wall thicknesses and wall temperatures is compared with the theory. The safety aspect of detonation tube is addressed by the observation that the prediction of critical tube thickness with thermal softening included is a better fit to the theoretical value than no thermal softening included.",32,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36162,"Effects of various boundary-layer bleed locations on the stability of an axisymmetric supersonic inlet has been investigated experimentally. The bleeds were located on the inlet compression cone and were designed to improve the stability margin of the inlet. The main objective of the study was to identify the boundary-layer bleed location and its effects on the improvement of the stability margin of the inlet. In addition, a buzz precursor detection methodology based on the rms level has been introduced. Experiments have been carried out on a mixed-compression inlet with a design Mach number of 2.0 and three different bleed locations at three freestream Mach numbers of 1.8, 2.0, and 2.2. All tests were conducted at an angle of attack of 0 deg. The results show that, based on the individual design of an inlet, a location can be found that the spilled normal shock stands at this location and consequently separation starts at the buzz onset. If the bleed slot is located in this place, the subcritical performance and stability margin of the inlet can be enhanced.",32,5

Combustion of metalized fuel, as well as pure JP-10, was carried out in a small-scale combustor. The oxygen-to-fuel ratios were set to be 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9, respectively. An additional trial of water injection during combustion was also tested. The pressures at the combustion chamber and nozzle exit, along with the thrust, were measured during the combustion; and intervals of true values of the specific impulse were presented. The results showed that a relatively higher combustion efficiency was achieved with JP-10-based slurry by 3.0 to 9.0% when compared to pure JP-10. However, the specific impulse could be increased only when the combustion-induced heat release was improved enough to overcome the two-phase loss. Depositions at different positions were collected after combustion for deep analysis; and the results of the x-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry analysis, scanning electron microscope, and laser light scattering were presented. A relatively high oxidation rate of the aluminum was obtained in tests without water injection, and the solid particles were mainly spherical and in dimensions of 100–300 nm. In the tests with water injection, stable combustion and increased thrust were achieved; whereas the combustion efficiency and specific impulse were deceased. And, the size of the particles was increased due to the addition of water.",32,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36028,"A new design method for inward-turning streamline-traced inlets is presented. Resulting designs are intended for low-supersonic low-drag low-boom applications such as that required for NASA’s proposed low-boom flight demonstration aircraft. A critical feature of these designs is the internal cowl lip angle that allows for little or no flow turning on the outer nacelle. Present methods using conical-flow “Busemann” parent flowfields have simply truncated, or otherwise modified, the stream-traced contours to include this internal cowl angle. Such modifications disrupt the parent flowfield, reducing inlet performance and flow uniformity. The method presented herein merges a conical flowfield that includes a leading shock with a truncated Busemann flowfield in a manner that minimizes unwanted interactions. A leading internal cowl angle is now inherent in the parent flowfield, and inlet contours traced from this flowfield retain its high performance and good flow uniformity. Computational fluid dynamics analysis of a candidate inlet design is presented that verifies the design technique, and it reveals a “starting” issue with the basic geometry. A minor modification to the cowl lip region is shown to eliminate this phenomenon, thereby allowing starting and smooth transition to subcritical operation as backpressure is increased. An inlet critical-point total pressure recovery of 96% is achieved based on computational fluid dynamics results for a Mach 1.7 freestream design. Correction for boundary-layer displacement thickness and sizing for a given engine airflow requirement are also discussed.",32,5

The present study demonstrates that the experimental accuracy could be much improved by an actively controlled ramp heating instead of the conventional step-heating approach. A general design guideline for the proposed ramp-heating method is derived theoretically and further demonstrated by simulation cases. This paper also presents a detailed experimental study for transonic turbine blade-tip heat transfer. A repeatable, high-resolution tip heat transfer coefficient contour is obtained through transient infrared measurement with the proposed ramp-heating method. Detailed uncertainty analysis shows that the resulting heat transfer coefficient uncertainty level is much lower than the experimental data currently available in the open literature.

In this paper, the effects of the operational conditions, such as the pressure ratio, rotational speed, and inlet preswirl, were numerically investigated. A novel transient computational-fluid-dynamics method based on the multifrequency elliptical whirling orbit model was used to predict transient leakage flow rates and frequency-dependent rotordynamic coefficients for a tooth-on-stator, labyrinth gas seal. The accuracy and availability of the transient computational-fluid-dynamics method were demonstrated with the experimental data of frequency-dependent rotordynamic coefficients at two rotational speeds with inlet preswirl. Transient computational-fluid-dynamics solutions were conducted at three pressure ratios (three inlet pressures and three outlet pressures), three rotational speeds, and three inlet preswirl ratios. Numerical results of leakage flow rates and rotordynamic coefficients for different operational conditions were presented and compared, paying special attention to the effective stiffness, effective damping, and crossover frequency of the effective damping term. The conclusions show that the magnitudes of all seal force coefficients are roughly proportional to the seal supply pressure but insensitive to the backpressure. Increasing rotational speed and increasing inlet preswirl both result in a significant decrease in the effective damping as well as an obvious increase in the crossover frequency and destabilizing cross-coupling stiffness.",32,5

It combines the advantages of a nozzle with small area ratio under sea-level conditions and a large area ratio nozzle under high-altitude conditions. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations on two-dimensional axisymmetric grids were conducted at DLR, German Aerospace Center in Lampoldshausen to investigate the transition from one mode to the other of a dual-bell nozzle model with positive pressure gradient extension. A cold flow test campaign conducted at DLR’s cold flow test facility P6.2 provided validation data for the numerical approach. The present study investigates the influence of different turbulence models and feeding pressure gradients on the dual-bell flow transition behavior. Better results were achieved for the Spalart–Allmaras and Reynolds stress turbulence model. A clear impact of the feeding pressure ramp on the dual-bell transition pressure ratio and the flow separation position velocity was shown. The transition nozzle pressure ratio was predicted with an accuracy of 1%. For the hysteresis between transition and retransition nozzle pressure ratio, an accuracy of approximately 10% was reached.

Lean of the blades is one of the crucial features that have a significant influence on their performance. This paper numerically investigates mechanisms by which lean affects the performance of a transonic impeller with twin splitters. Lean is defined relative to the tangential direction, and the variation range of lean angle has been chosen from to . Results show that the variation of efficiency value is 4.5% and the optimal lean angle occurs near 0 deg. Lean influences the flowfields through the effects on the shock structure, the spanwise pressure gradient, the axial-to-radial flow separation, and the secondary flow structure. The induced second blade surface vortex with positive lean tends to migrate the low-momentum flow from hub to shroud, whereas the induced inward spanwise pressure gradient with negative lean enhances the axial-to-radial flow separation, both of which increase the tip leakage loss and lead to the efficiency drop of leaned designs. The optimal lean angle is deduced to be the result of a trade-off between the suppression of axial-to-radial flow separation and the suppression of secondary flow.",32,5

Shock-tunnel experiments were conducted at a flow total enthalpy of , with a fuel–air equivalence ratio of 0.2. A contoured wedge model with a wall cavity and a cowl was used. To investigate the shock impinging effect on flameholding, different cowl locations were considered, varying from the upstream of the injection to the cavity ramp. Shadowgraph and CH* chemiluminescence optical images were obtained for each location. The experimental data showed that flameholding can be categorized as three distinct types of interaction. The first interaction, with the cowl shock impinging upstream of the fuel injection, showed a gradual quenching of CH* radical in the cavity during steady flow, and flameholding was not maintained. The second interaction, with the cowl shock impinging at the cavity ramp, showed flameholding in the shear layer above the cavity and downstream throughout. The third interaction, with the cowl shock impinging directly at the fuel injection, showed flameholding in the entire cavity and the downstream region.

20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36060,"The present work combines numerical and experimental efforts to investigate the effect of nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges on the low-temperature oxidation of mixtures under reduced pressure conditions. The nonequilibrium plasma discharge is modeled using a one-dimensional framework, employing separate electron and neutral gas temperatures, and using a detailed plasma and combustion chemical kinetic mechanism. Good agreement is seen between the numerical and experimental results, and both results show that plasma enables low-temperature oxidation. Compared to zero-dimensional modeling, the one-dimensional modeling significantly improves predictions, probably because it produces a more complete physical description (including sheath formation and accurate reduced electric field). Furthermore, the one- and zero-dimensional models show very different reaction pathways, using the same chemical kinetic mechanism and thus suggest different interpretations of the experimental results. Two kinetic mechanisms (HP-Mech and USC Mech-II) are examined in this study. The modeling results from HP-Mech agree better with the experimental results than those of USC Mech-II because USC Mech-II does not include the reaction pathway. The model shows that 75–77% of the input pulse energy is consumed during the breakdown process in electron impact dissociation, excitation, and ionization reactions, which efficiently produce reactive radical species, fuel fragments, and excited species. The modeling results using HP-Mech reveal that reactions between and generate 24% of OH, 19% of HCO, 60% of , 63% of , and 17% of . These in turn significantly enhance hydrocarbon oxidation, since 83% of CO comes from HCO and 53% of comes from under the present low-temperature environment and short time scale.",32,5

This phenomenon may happen at the transient startup of the upper-stage rocket engine. In this paper, experimental investigation of cryogenic fluid injection into a low-pressure environment is performed using liquid nitrogen instead of the real cryogenic propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid methane). With the help of a high-speed shadowgraph technique and with the temperature measurement, the characteristics of flashing are explored, including its evolution process, the spray angle, the spray thermal behaviors along the injection centerline, and the spray phase solidification. The results show that bubble nucleation is a reasonable controlling factor for the flashing evolution process. The nondimensional energy barrier is conditionally indicative of the flashing transition process, and it works well under low injection temperature conditions. The drastic temperature drop due to flashing phenomena causes liquid jet solidification, which may pose a challenge for the engine startup process. An analysis of the spray lateral propagation indicates that superheat exerts a substantial effect on the spray angle enhancement; however, this enhanced effect is found to decrease with an increase of liquid superheat.",32,5

Comparisons made with a standard wedge-type vortex generator using streamwise-velocity profiles, near-surface streamwise-velocity contours, pitot pressure deficit contours, etc., indicate that the new device has less device drag and produces fuller near-surface streamwise velocities downstream of the device. It is observed that the primary counter-rotating vortex pair formed due to the vortex generator lifts off at a slower rate when a slotted vortex generator is used. Computations of an impinging oblique-shock/boundary-layer interaction at Mach 2.5 for a flow turning angle of 7 deg, with flow control using (separately) an array of slotted and standard vortex generators, indicate that the slotted vortex generators with are most effective in reducing the region with reversed flow when placed closer to the shock/boundary-layer interaction region.",32,5

Wind-tunnel tests are conducted over wide operating conditions to determine the performance improvement by the bump-shaped vortex generator. The results indicate that, with the aid of the unique vortex generator, the upstream fuselage boundary layer is effectively pushed away from the duct entrance, improving the entering flow quality and thereby the performance of the submerged inlet. Despite the 0.76% drag penalty of the aircraft at most, the unique vortex generator is observed to increase the total pressure recovery of the submerged inlet by as much as 3.7% at a freestream Mach number of 0.73 and 5% at a freestream Mach number of 0.90. A strong relation between the installation position and the height of the vortex generator is found such that, at the optimal installation position, the local boundary layer thickness is equivalent to the height of the vortex generator. As a result, the optimal location of the vortex generator moves toward the duct entrance with the increase of its height.",32,5

In this paper, the effects of the geometrical parameters, such as the sealing clearance, tooth number, and cavity depth, were numerically investigated using a proposed three-dimensional transient computational-fluid-dynamics perturbation method based on the multifrequency elliptical whirling orbit model. Transient leakage flow rates and frequency-dependent rotordynamic coefficients of labyrinth seals were presented and compared for three sealing clearances, three tooth numbers, and four cavity depths. All these labyrinth seal designs have identical tooth profile, rotor diameter, and axial length. For all labyrinth seal designs, transient computational-fluid-dynamics solutions were carried out at the same operating condition: inlet pressure of 6.9 bar, pressure ratio of 0.45, rotational speed of 15 krpm, and medium inlet preswirl ratio of 0.5. The numerical results show that the cavity depth is the most important factor that significantly influences the seal rotordynamic coefficients, followed by sealing clearance and tooth number in descending order. Too small sealing clearance may result in a risk of high rotor vibrations during a critical-speed transition or even instability if the natural frequency drops below the crossover frequency due to the negative effective stiffness. Increasing tooth number or increasing cavity depth of the labyrinth seal can improve the rotor stability and extend the useful operating frequency range of the machine, due to the increased positive effective damping and decreased crossover frequency.",32,5
