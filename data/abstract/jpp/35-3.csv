0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36887,"The sulfur attack and coking of bioethanol fuel in rocket engine combustion chamber cooling channels were evaluated based on the results of field tests conducted under engine operating conditions for a copper alloy and a nickel alloy. The field test was conducted in the open air because this apparatus is about 6 m long and for the safety of operators. After the experiments, test specimens were subject to electron probe microanalyzer and x-ray diffractometer analyses, as well as roughness and Brinell hardness measurements. It became clear that increased surface roughness due to sulfur attack was only observed in the case of high sulfur content, whereas no significant evidence of sulfur attack was observed in other cases of normal bioethanol. Increased surface roughness due to coking was observed in most cases for the nickel alloy, and it was particularly noticeable in the case of long duration. The current evaluation of the heat transfer coefficient revealed a tendency for it to change at bioethanol temperatures higher than 500 K, depending on the constant pressure specific heat, which should be considered in the design of combustion chamber cooling channels for bioethanol-fueled rocket engines. From engine system calculations taking into account the effect of coking, it was found that coking and not material cycle fatigue was the driving factor in determining the number of times of reusability in cases in which the nickel alloy was used at the cooling chamber outer cylinder.",35,3

However, airframe integration increases the risk for material failure due to exposure of downstream components to high-temperature gases from the high-performance convergent-divergent nozzle. The formation of hot streaks must be understood if mitigation strategies are to be developed. To that end, this paper establishes a set of novel characterization parameters based on the temperature distribution and flow conditions at the nozzle exit. Hot streak phenomena observed for a set of serpentine exhaust nozzles with varying geometries are compared using a modified Dean number (called the White number) that accounts for arbitrary cross-sectional area and streamline curvature changes. Using these parameters and computational fluid dynamics, quantifiable differences are observed in the distribution and intensity of hot flow at the nozzle exit. The results show that hot steak phenomena are most prominent for nozzles with a lower White number. The results also provide insight into flow physics acting as primary drivers of hot streak phenomena. The effects of bulk engine swirl are considered and exhibit a significant impact on surface temperature distribution and the formation of hot streaks.",35,3

However, the low thermal stability and poor electrical control properties of HAN-based ECSPs limit its application. In this paper, lithium-perchlorate/polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA)-based aluminized ECSPs are prepared, and the effects of materials on the curing process and the theoretical specific impulse of the propellant are investigated. The thermal decomposition and burning characteristics were also investigated. The ratio of lithium perchlorate /PVA/water to the molecular weight of PVA is important to the curing characteristic of lithium-perchlorate/PVA-based aluminized propellants. In addition, the degree of alcoholysis of the PVA polymer affects the curing time of the system. According to the results calculated using the NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Applications program, the contents of the oxidizer, aluminum, and water in the composition of lithium-perchlorate/PVA-based aluminized propellant can effectively regulate the properties of the propellant. During thermal decomposition, this propellant is more thermally stable than the -based electrically controlled propellant. The burning rates of lithium-perchlorate/PVA-based aluminized propellants at a voltage ranging from 80 to 400 V dc and pressure from 0.1 to 5.0 MPa were investigated. The results showed that the burning rate changes as a function of voltage input and pressure. The burning characteristics of the propellants can be regulated in real time by changing the electric power input.",35,3

The present study characterizes a small two-stroke glow plug engine for up to 10 kg class of UAVs. To enhance the specific power output of the engine, nitromethane was used as a fuel additive. Understanding the effect of nitromethane concentration on the engine characteristics is the key objective of this present study. An engine test rig has been built to test a small two-stroke engine. The engine was run at various equivalence ratios. Engine characteristics such as thrust, RPM, torque, power, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) have been measured and compared with the base methanol fuelled engine. The results show around a 24% rise in the engine thrust with 40% (by mass) of nitromethane addition to methanol fuel. Energy balance analysis was carried out to show that the increased thrust is due to enhanced combustion efficiency with nitromethane addition. Hence, it is proposed that nitromethane blends can be used in short bursts whenever a large thrust is required by the UAV.",35,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37216,"The objective of this work is the validation of a moving-body immersed boundary methodology used for the calculation of multiple pure tone noise generated by supersonic rotor cascades. This methodology is based on a discrete-forcing approach for which the boundary conditions are directly imposed on control volumes associated with moving or static surfaces. Four cases are considered: 1) rotor alone in nominal conditions; 2) rotor–stator interaction in nominal conditions; 3) rotor alone with stagger angle variations; and 4) rotor–stator interaction with stagger angle variations. For all cases, the rotor blades are treated by the immersed boundary methodology as moving surfaces with supersonic speed. Cases 1 and 2 are characterized by a regular shock-expansion system, moving along with the supersonic rotor blades, that shows well-defined sawtooth patterns of equal amplitude in the circumferential direction. The decay of the shock intensity of the system along the axial direction show excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Case 3 evidences the generation of multiple pure tones, characterized by irregular sawtooth patterns in the circumferential direction that show excellent agreement with the semianalytical method predictions. In case 4, the progressive differences in the upstream direction between the numerical results and the semianalytical method predictions emphasize the influence of the stator vanes in the pressure field that cannot be captured by the latter.",35,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36928,"This work presents the experimental investigation of heat fluxes through the walls of a reduced-scale rocket motor using hydrogen and oxygen as propellants. The engine is water cooled so that it can be run in steady state for up to 120 s. More than 100 thermocouples are used to retrieve the wall temperature and derive heat fluxes. It is shown how the chamber pressure affects the overall heat flux level, whereas the mixture ratio greatly influences its distribution. Direct visualization of the flame provides an indication that the heat flux distribution is correlated to the location of heat release given by hydroxyle radical visualization.",35,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37057,"Formaldehyde planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging was performed in a premixed, ethylene-fueled dual-mode scramjet combustor to study the flame structure and dynamic flame behavior. PLIF is used as a marker to provide information on the structure and position of the lower-temperature portion of the reaction zone. Low-repetition-rate (10 Hz) measurements were acquired at several cross-flow planes along the axial flow direction. Statistical analysis of the topology indicates sparse concentrations of formaldehyde that are intermittently detected by the PLIF measurement. Comparisons between previous large-eddy simulations, laboratory-scale flames, and the current experimental measurements indicate discrepancies between the expected and measured formaldehyde concentrations and structure. High-speed formaldehyde PLIF also was conducted at 50 kHz to further investigate the intermittency of the formaldehyde layers in the flow.",35,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37166,"The neutralizers in ion thruster systems do not generate thrust force. Hence, the power consumption of a neutralizer limits the thrust efficiency of the ion thruster system. Therefore, an ion thruster system is proposed that uses a negative ion source that generates thrust force as well as neutralizes the positive ion beam. In this study, in order to verify the feasibility of this ion thruster system by ground experiments, a negative fullerene ion source was developed and three experiments were conducted. First, in order to demonstrate that the satellite can accelerate ions without becoming charged, the positive and negative ion beams were accelerated in the floating condition using a feedback circuit. Second, in order to verify whether the formation of the virtual anode could be suppressed, the space potential and the beam profile in the downstream region of the ion beam were measured. Third, in order to demonstrate that the thruster system generates thrust force, the thrust with a beam target was measured. From the aforementioned results, it was concluded that the experimental verification of the feasibility of the ion thruster with combined positive and negative ions without a neutralizer was successful.",35,3

About 98% of the world’s aviation is produced by aircraft with gross takeoff mass above 25 metric tonnes, referred to herein as airliners. Propulsion of such aircraft can require power and energy levels of tens of megawatts and hundreds of thousands of kilowatt hours per flight. The challenges to electrically powering these airliners are examined in the context of reduction. Additional possible benefits such as noise and cost reduction are explored. All electric (battery), hybrid, and turboelectric approaches are considered. Technical issues including weight, efficiency, and heat rejection are examined. In addition, economic and policy implications of an industry conversion to electric propulsion are discussed. The conclusion of this study is that electric propulsion is not a promising path to significant reduction of aviation’s in the first half of the 21st century.",35,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37314,"Large-eddy simulations (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations were performed to investigate modeling weaknesses in two popular RANS models, realizable and shear-stress transport (SST), in predicting film cooling of a flat plate. The film-jets issue from a plenum through one row of circular holes of diameter and length that are inclined at 35° relative to the plate. The LES and RANS solutions generated were validated by comparing with data from PIV and thermal measurements. The LES results agree well, whereas RANS results show large errors. Results obtained show the turbulent and thermal structure of the jets predicted by the two RANS models to differ considerably. However, both models are consistent in underpredicting the spread of the film-cooling jet. The counter-rotating vortex pair dominates the interaction of the jet and crossflow in the near-wall region, and neither RANS model could predict the strength and structure of that interaction. The gradient-diffusion and Boussinesq hypotheses were evaluated by using the LES data. Comparing LES and RANS results shows that tends to overpredict eddy viscosity, whereas SST tends to underpredict the eddy viscosity. Additionally, both models predict very low values of eddy viscosity near the wall, which leads to incorrect Reynolds stresses. Although regions of counter-gradient diffusion and stress-strain misalignment were found in the near-wall region, further above the wall, the jet behaved according to the hypotheses.",35,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37323,"A novel thruster concept for CubeSats and other small satellites using hydrogen peroxide vapor as a propellant is presented and evaluated. This concept leads to the highest theoretical vacuum specific impulse of any hydrogen peroxide system (greater than 200 s) while retaining the advantages of small size and simple construction typical of liquid monopropellant systems. For a nominally sized thruster, the theoretical thrust can be varied from 0.5 to 8 mN simply by changing the temperature of the tank in which the liquid hydrogen peroxide is stored. Theoretical performance parameters of liquid and vapor thrusters are compared. A prototype system (tank, heater, platinum catalyst, and nozzle) is constructed and tested. It is found that, when vapor is allowed to flow over the catalyst, its temperature increases slowly at first and then increases rapidly when the vapor hydrogen peroxide mole fraction exceeds approximately 0.5 and a catalyst temperature of about 400 K is reached. An analysis of the equilibrium state on the catalyst indicates that this temperature corresponds to the condition in which the surface coverage shifts from predominantly water to a significant fraction of open platinum sites where can adsorb and react.",35,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37204,"The effects of inlet distortion and shockwave interaction on fuel-air distribution and ignition in a cavity-based flameholder with supersonic flow were investigated using nanosecond-gated laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (n-LIBS). Experiments were conducted in a Mach-3 freestream direct-connect-type wind tunnel with direct cavity fueling. Ethylene, , was used as the fuel for all testing. Inlet distortion was created using a wedge on the top wall of the tunnel, which formed an oblique shock. The distortion wedge was positioned at two distinct locations such that the shock intersected 1) the boundary layer just upstream of the cavity or 2) the shear layer above the cavity flameholder. N-LIBS with direct spectrum matching was implemented for quantitative measurements of gas density and fuel mole fraction throughout the cavity in both pre-ignited and ignited conditions for three different cavity flow patterns (two distortion cases and no distortion). For all flow patterns fuel mole fraction was seen to increase in the cavity between the nonignited case and the ignited case, due to changes in air entrainment from the freestream. Distortion was seen to affect the cavity shear layer and thus the fuel distribution within the cavity, as well as local gas density.",35,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37359,"Silica-doped alumina–supported catalyst, containing manganese oxides, doped with cobalt oxide, was prepared in situ by wet impregnation, vacuum drying, and calcination at 700°C. Potassium permanganate and cobalt nitrate were used as precursors and thermally decomposed. The active phase content was determined by simple mass measurement. Subsequently, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and physical adsorption by Brunauer-Emmet-Teller tests have been carried out to determine the morphology, chemical and phase composition, and specific surface area. The catalyst was subjected to the real-environment testing in a packed catalyst bed of a small rocket engine; 98% hydrogen peroxide was applied as propellant. At the design stage of a packed catalyst, it was assumed that a bed loading varied from 24.5 to . The total propellant throughput was 5.43 kg. After the test campaign, the microscopic observation of the structure and physisorption were repeated to describe changes in the structure of the active phase. Test parameters and their change in time were analyzed. The influence of structural and chemical changes between fresh and tested catalysts was taken into consideration. The quality of pure carrier and manganese oxides catalyst, for decomposition of 98% hydrogen peroxide, was investigated. A comparison of performance with alumina-supported platinum catalyst was presented and discussed.",35,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36647,"Gas-centered swirl-coaxial injectors are typically adopted for staged combustion-cycle engines. The dynamic characteristics of gas-centered swirl-coaxial injectors were investigated in this study by inducing excitation on liquid flow through a mechanical pulsator. The effect of excitation was expressed as the injector transfer function, which was defined by the ratio of manifold pressure to film thickness. The geometry effect was investigated by changing the tangential inlet diameter and gap thickness. As the tangential inlet diameter increased, the excitation effect was significant in the film thickness and spray pattern. When the gap thickness decreased, the gain increased and the frequency at the gain decrease became higher. In addition, the momentum flux ratio was used to confirm the gas flow effect. The gain increased with the momentum flux ratio; however, shear instability resonance did not occur.",35,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37406,"This work addresses the nature of supercritical hydrogen-oxygen flame coupling to acoustics through visualization under conditions representative of upper-stage rocket engines. A research thrust chamber that shows self-excited combustion instabilities for certain operating conditions was used. Previous analysis proved that the instabilities are connected to injector acoustics. In this study a small optical access window was mounted in the chamber wall. High-speed flame radiation imaging of UV and blue wavelengths has been applied in order to analyze the acoustic-flame interaction of one of the 42 flames. Dynamic mode decomposition results for a case with 80-bar chamber pressure showed that the flame dynamics are strongly influenced by the LOX injector acoustics, whereas for a 50-bar chamber pressure load point no flame response to injector acoustics was observed. A potential source of acoustic excitation in the oxygen injectors based on hydrodynamic effects is consistent with the observations from the two load points.",35,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37421,"In this study, a kerosene surrogate model fuel containing 65 mol % -dodecane, 10% -tetradecane, and 25% decalin is developed by considering both the physical and chemical characteristics of practical aviation kerosene. By combining the skeletal (carbon number) core mechanism and the reduced large hydrocarbon submechanisms, a high-temperature chemical kinetic mechanism including 50 species and 274 reactions is constructed for the kerosene surrogate model fuel. This relatively small size enables the application of computational fluid dynamics. The performance of the skeletal mechanism is validated by examining various experimental laminar flame speeds of single components, mixtures, and practical kerosene. A sensitivity analysis of the laminar flame speed based on the constructed mechanism shows that the flame propagation of the kerosene is strongly dependent on the kinetics, and it is independent of the fuel-specific species and reactions.",35,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37286,"This paper describes the injection and combustion behavior of liquid reactants—ethanol and hydrogen peroxide—in relevant conditions for storable bi-propellant space thrusters. Particularly, this study points out the comparison between two fundamental injector designs based on impinging-jet atomization. First, like-doublet injection generates separate sprays of oxidizer and fuel that need to undergo vaporization, mixing, and chemical reaction. Second, unlike-triplet injection generates a unique spray of bipropellant mixture that only has to vaporize before burning. The effect of these two injection processes is compared in terms of spray pattern, drop size and velocity, as well as combustion efficiency. For this purpose, direct and -filtered visualizations of the reacting flow are performed, and the characteristic velocity is computed from experiments at combustion pressure 0.6 MPa and overall equivalence ratio in the range 0.5–2.2.",35,3
