0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37706,"Oxidizer feed-system coupled instabilities have been observed in several liquid and hybrid propellant rocket engines, although they are not likely to be catastrophic for the latter. However, severe pressure oscillation in hybrid rocket may result in a significant reduction in the performance of the propulsion system restricting the application of the technology. In this research, feed-system coupled instabilities were studied theoretically and experimentally for hybrid rocket engines. Two test campaigns were performed to investigate the effects of the precombustion chamber and oxidizer injector configurations on engine pressure oscillation. Then, an extended mathematical formulation (including the injector pressure drop, the precombustion chamber residence time, the gas residence time, and the combustion time lag) has been proposed. The investigation was based on a transfer function using the stability limit analysis and the root locus method. It has been found that the configuration of the precombustion chamber plays an important role in the nature of the feed-system coupled instabilities, and a correlation was proposed to predict the fundamental frequency based on the oxidizer precombustion chamber residence time. The work has shown that the precombustion chamber length and the oxidizer injection velocity are key parameters that affect the period of the pressure oscillations in hybrid engines subjected to feed-system coupled instabilities.",36,6
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37914,"A predictive numerical approach, based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations including the effects of turbulence, chemistry, fluid/surface interaction, and radiation, has been developed for paraffin-wax/oxygen hybrid rocket engines. A recently fired single-port paraffin-based hybrid rocket engine, with chamber pressures up to 19.1 bar, is taken as reference for the discussion of the results of the numerical simulations, which outline important features of the internal ballistics otherwise not observed in the experiments. For the engine under consideration, radiation accounts for 33–62% of the total wall heat flux on the grain, depending on the radial dimension and chamber pressure. The rebuilding of the experimental time-averaged regression rate and chamber pressure is carried out with fair success, enabling their prediction with a maximum error of 15 and 10%, respectively. The numerical model can aid the design and the optimization of future paraffin-based hybrid rocket engines.",36,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37653,"A numerical investigation of the performance of a supersonic combustor designed for a flight Mach 8 is presented. Numerical simulations are used to assess the characteristics and operational limits of the combustor at design and off-design conditions. The combustor design point corresponds to the cruise condition at a Mach number of 8 and an altitude of 30 km. Off-design conditions correspond to a Mach number of 8 at 28 km altitude and a Mach number of 6 at 26 km altitude. Each off-design condition was investigated at three different angles of attack: 2, 0, and . For constant flight Mach number and altitude, the variation of the angle of attack showed significant influence on the performance of the combustor, mainly on the ignition length. Flying at a negative angle of attack resulted in intense combustion and reduced ignition length. For the Mach 6 off-design condition, a dual-operation mode (ramjet–scramjet) with regions of subsonic combustion was observed. At such condition, it was possible to extend the operation of the combustor and avoid subsonic combustion regions by varying the angle of attack to a positive value. For a constant flight Mach number and altitude, the variation of the angle of attack showed an interesting mechanism to control combustion.",36,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37635,"It has been recognized in recent years that high-altitude atmospheric ice crystals pose a threat to aircraft engines in flight. It is believed that ice can accrete inside the core compressor, although the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly understood. To model ice crystal accretion, an estimate of the proportion of the impinging ice and water that sticks to a surface (the sticking efficiency) is required. This Paper presents data from experiments undertaken using an axisymmetric test article in an altitude ice crystal wind tunnel. A 35 deg half-angle nose was used for a parametric study of Mach number, total water content, wet bulb temperature, and particle size distribution. An assessment of the response of a multiwire probe used for measuring liquid water content is also presented. A shadowgraphy technique was used to measure the ice accretion growth rate on the nose. The results show that sticking efficiency has a strong dependency on particle melt ratio. Erosion is shown to be correlated with particle size, Mach number, and surface angle. New semi-empirical models are presented for sticking probability and erosion.",36,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37666,"A liquid bipropellant rotating detonation rocket engine was successfully test fired. The 6.5-in.-diam engine operates on a mixture of rocket-grade hydrogen peroxide and triglyme. Ignition is accomplished hypergolically, with the addition of a promoter to the fuel. Eight cases of spontaneously initiated, single-wave, rotating detonations were observed. Detonation wave speeds were near or exceeding Chapman–Jouguet calculations. Evidence of condensed-phase reactions was also seen, damaging hardware in short order. Both a rotating detonation and a bulk-slapping mode characterized the engine operation.",36,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37923,"Iron oxide is the most common catalyst in solid rocket propellant. Increased performance of propellant by encapsulating iron oxide particles within ammonium perchlorate (AP) has been previously demonstrated, but only nanoscale particles were used, and encapsulation was only accomplished in fine AP ( microns in diameter). In this study, the size of the particle inclusions were extended to micron scale within the AP particles, and the particle sizes of the AP-encapsulated catalyst particles were increased to the coarse region (hundreds of microns). Fractional crystallization techniques were used with fine AP-encapsulated particles acting as nucleation sites for precipitation. This paper reports catalyst particle inclusions of micron scale, as well as nanoscale, within AP and presents characterization of this encapsulation. Encapsulating micron-sized particles and growing these composite particles could pave the way for numerous possible applications. A study of the thermal degradation of these AP-encapsulated particles compared against a standard mixture of iron oxide and AP showed that AP-encapsulated micron-scale catalyst particles exhibited similar behavior to AP-encapsulated nanoscale particles. Using computed tomography, it was found that catalyst particles were dispersed throughout the interior of coarse AP-encapsulated micron-scale catalyst particles and decomposition was induced within these particles around catalyst-rich regions.",36,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37992,"Hybrid rockets have several advantages with respect to current propulsion systems like simplicity, safety, reliability, environmental friendliness, and lower cost. To size the combustion chamber, it is fundamental to understand how the length, the external diameter, the volume loading, and the length-to-diameter ratio vary with the design parameters like scale, burning time, average mixture ratio, initial oxidizer flux, and propellant combination. The equations available in the literature are not in explicit form with respect to the aforementioned design parameters, and sometimes they can be misinterpreted by hybrid rocket engineers. Moreover, it is not possible to determine the instantaneous and average characteristic velocities during the burn without a numerical time integration. To show explicitly the real trends, a set of analytical equations has been developed. The key step is the definition of the relation between initial and average mixture ratio and the asymptotic treatment with respect to the ratio between the external and internal diameters. Moreover, an approximate explicit semi-analytical expression of the instantaneous and average characteristic velocities is provided. The explicit analytical equations are validated with the exact implicit solutions showing good agreement and exact asymptotic behavior.",36,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37793,"Three different heat exchangers (copper metal foam, copper disks, and stainless-steel disks) with lower effective surface areas than nominal catalysts used in thrusters were tested for nitrous oxide decomposition. These heat exchangers were preheated to thermal decomposition temperatures using an inductive heating system and placed in a vacuum bell jar to mitigate heat loss to the environment. Testing with copper metal foam resulted in complete degradation of the heat exchanger due to oxidation from nitrous oxide decomposition. A set of copper disks, uniquely designed to maximize tortuosity of the flow, was implemented in an attempt to address the oxidation issues. While the preliminary test did confirm steady-state decomposition of nitrous oxide within the heat exchanger, further tests resulted in temperatures exceeding the melting point of copper within the disks. The last heat exchanger was a set of stainless-steel disks of the same design. Repeated tests all successfully achieved steady-state decomposition of nitrous oxide within a 2 min interval.",36,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37834,"A novel diode laser-based ignition technique for hybrid propulsion systems has been developed. In an effort to determine the physical ignition mechanism, a test series was conducted in an optically accessible, slab-burning combustion chamber. High-speed imaging of the ignition event has revealed that high-temperature carbon particles created during laser-induced flash pyrolysis of the solid fuel grain act as the carriers of ignition energy. Tests run on both charring and noncharring thermoplastic fuel candidates support this observation. In this paper, an initial theory of the ignition mechanism is developed; and supporting evidence collected from tests in both oxidizing (oxygen) and inert (nitrogen) flow environments is presented. Finally, a number of observations regarding the effects of oxidizer velocity and incident laser power on ignition delay are discussed.",36,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37929,"A high-power nested Hall thruster was operated with cathode flow fractions from 7 to 3% of the total anode flow rate in a two-channel operating configuration at 27 kW total discharge power. The thruster was operated with a state-of-the-art high-current cathode featuring novel external propellant injectors. In stand-alone testing, the cathode has been shown to operate stably up to 300 A with a total flow rate of 36 sccm of xenon. The experiment reported here demonstrated the extensibility of these low flow rates to operation when integrated into the thruster. The impact of the lower-than-nominal flow rates was evaluated using direct thrust measurements, plasma diagnostics, and high-speed current measurement. These results were used to calculate the cathode coupling voltage, most probable beam ion voltage, anode efficiency, total efficiency, and the discharge current oscillation magnitude. It was found that the thruster could be operated with little identifiable change in behavior or performance with a cathode fraction as small as 4%. When the cathode flow fraction was reduced beyond that, the thruster exhibited reduced performance. Implications of these results for future high-power operation of Hall thrusters are discussed.",36,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38047,"The effect of Tandem-Hole configuration on penetration and combustion in supersonic crossflow was studied using three injectors having two tandem holes of 0.7 mm diameter with a spacing of 5, 10, and 14 mm. A Single-Hole injector with the same injection area was studied for comparison. Shadowgraph results in Mach 1.9, , flow condition with kerosene as injectant indicated that higher penetration was obtained for the Tandem-Hole injectors with spacing 10 and 14 mm compared to the Single-Hole injector. This higher penetration was due to the shielding provided by the upstream liquid jet for the downstream jet. The overall penetration increased as the spacing between the holes and the J ratio increased. Correlations were developed for the penetration of both types of injectors. Supersonic combustion studies in a strut-cavity-based combustor with inflow conditions of Mach 2, , showed that the performance of the Tandem-Hole injectors was superior. At higher equivalence ratios, the superior performance of the Tandem-Hole injector was enhanced. The estimated total pressure loss based on a one-dimensional model indicated that the effect of injector configuration was negligible, whereas the presence of a strut caused significant loss.",36,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38067,"The combustion enhancement by ozone has been studied for single-component fuels in many different settings; however, the impact of ozone addition on a multicomponent fuel has been experimentally underexplored. This paper investigates the ozone-assisted flame propagation of a mixture of alkenes and alkanes in a low-pressure Hencken burner over a range of equivalence ratios, ozone concentrations, and pressures. One-dimensional numerical simulations of the flame speed using a detailed chemical kinetic model are also conducted for comparison to the experimental measurements. Both the experimental measurements and numerical simulations indicate that higher ozone concentrations result in increased flame speeds of methane/ethylene/air mixtures and that the relative flame speed enhancement by ozone is larger for off-stoichiometric conditions. Although quantitative agreement is achieved for the cases without ozone addition, the ozone-assisted flame speeds are generally overpredicted by the kinetic model. Finally, a computational analysis of the detailed flame structure is performed, and the coupling between fuel chemistry and the ozone H-abstraction reaction, , is found to be crucial in determining the relative degree of flame speed enhancement of methane/ethylene/air mixtures by ozone.",36,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37815,"Flame behavior at conditions approaching boundary layer flashback was studied in fuel-lean premixed swirl flames with a central bluff-body flame holder. High-speed chemiluminescence images were collected at over 450 different combinations of fuel composition (hydrogen/methane blends), equivalence ratio, flow rate, and reactant temperature. A selected group of conditions was further examined using simultaneous high-speed stereoscopic particle image velocimetry and OH planar laser induced fluorescence. Over a range of conditions between stable burning in the combustor and total flashback, the flame would intermittently propagate through the bluff-body boundary layer into the reactant feed tube for a period of time before retreating back to the combustion chamber. Statistical characteristics of the flame dynamics, such as the depth and duration of the flashback events, showed consistent relationships across all combinations of operating parameters. Hence, tracking these statistics provides a potential means of anticipating an upcoming flashback event. The number of transient flashback events per second showed particular promise as an early warning sign due its rather gradual change with flame propagation depth. Laser diagnostics revealed local reductions in axial velocity ahead of the tip of the flame protrusions. The strength of these reductions increased as the flame moved farther upstream; however, no total flow reversal was observed.",36,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37298,"A pulsed electric thruster named Pulsed Electrogasdynamic (PEG) thruster was investigated. In this thruster, the propellant gas is accelerated gasdynamically to high exhaust velocities by pulsed electric discharge. Laboratory models of the PEG thruster were developed and successfully operated for evaluation of performance potentials. The PEG thruster is intended for in-space propulsion such as in-orbit maneuver for small satellites and attitude control and station-keeping for larger satellites. In this paper, we discuss the background of the thruster concept, experimental research for performance evaluation, and potential applications. It is concluded that the PEG thruster, when developed to technical maturity, will be a simple, robust, and lightweight thruster for in-space propulsion.",36,6
