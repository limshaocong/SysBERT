An unlike doublet injector and combustion chamber are connected to an evacuation system for simulation of high-altitude conditions. Chilled gas flows through the oxidizer manifold, rapidly cooling the internal surfaces to simulate the evaporation of nitrogen tetroxide. The chamber is heated above the fuel saturation pressure, whereby a metered quantity of fuel vapor is introduced into the chamber. The vapor is allowed to advect into the oxidizer manifold and reach phase equilibrium at the manifold surface temperature conditions. After a select residence time, the oxidizer is introduced into the manifold, simulating an engine restart. Hypergolic reactions in the manifold are recorded as accelerometer responses. A correlation is developed, showing the relationship between the accelerometer response, the thermodynamic conditions in the manifold, the fuel vapor levels in the chamber, and the evacuation conditions. The results show a very strong correlation of the occurrence and magnitude of the oxidizer manifold explosions with the ambient pressure the engine is evacuating into.",29,6

The capabilities of the air-turborocket expander were first assessed through a complete theoretical study of the thermodynamic cycle. This analytical study allowed the identification of the relevant nondimensional parameters in the cycle analysis and performance. A numerical model based on differential-algebraic equations was developed using an object oriented simulation tool. Parametric analyses were carried out to evaluate the performance and identify design tradeoff compromises. Finally, the expander cycle was optimized for the acceleration phase of an antipodal hypersonic vehicle fueled by hydrogen, considering the trajectory and constraints set by the thrust requirement, air mass flow captured by the intake in the supersonic regime, and engine transversal area. The objective was to minimize the power required by the turbomachinery, and the outcome was the design operating line.",29,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34849,"In this paper, a new method is proposed for evaluating thrust in the wide-frequency range from 0 Hz beyond the pendulum resonant frequency. The proposed method uses position control and a disturbance observer based on pendulum acceleration and solenoid-actuator current. A controller monitors pendulum motion and adjusts the force of a solenoid actuator in such a way that the pendulum angular displacement is kept constant. Simultaneously, the disturbance observer evaluates both invariant and time-varying components of thrust by use of pendulum acceleration and solenoid-actuator current. Spring and damping coefficients originating from wires, tubes, and the thrust stand can be ignored due to the position control. A calibrator, yielding both constant and periodically varying, biased forces, was also prototyped to show that the proposed method can evaluate thrust in a wide-frequency range from 0 Hz beyond the resonant frequency. The prototype thrust stand successfully measured thrust in the frequency range from 0 to 65 Hz with errors less than 16%, whereas the conventional null-balance method yielded 810% overestimation of thrust amplitude at a resonant frequency of approximately 15 Hz.",29,6

Results elaborate the nature of local flame wrinkling and heat release fluctuations. Significantly, these results show that these different induced fluctuations exhibit very different sensitivities to helical mode number , swirl strength, and dimensionless frequency. In addition, the degree of axisymmetry of the time averaged flame plays a crucial role in these interactions, particularly in how flow disturbances translate into heat release oscillations. Thus, the helical mode , with the dominant contribution to local flame wrinkling and heat release, , and spatially integrated heat release fluctuations, , is generally different. For example, helical mode , leading to the largest amplitude of local flame wrinkling and heat release in a solid body swirl flowfield, is given by , where is the ratio of swirl angular rotation rate to forcing frequency, is the component of mean tangential velocity resolved along the axial forcing direction, and is the phase speed of the convecting vortex. In contrast, only the axisymmetric mode, , leads to global surface area fluctuations in axisymmetric flames, which are also completely insensitive to swirl number. Because the maximum amplitude of local flame wrinkling is, in general, excited by helical modes with , care must be taken in interpreting the significance of large scale helical flame flapping, as often is captured from planar experimental data or visualized in computations.",29,6

Liquid jet is injected into an air crossflow with a speed of . A series of experimental tests covering Weber numbers from 29–82, and momentum flux ratios from 10–133, are conducted using the shadowgraph method and phase Doppler particle analyzer. The shadowgraph images are processed to find the penetration depth and to investigate different regimes of breakup. The phase Doppler particle analyzer is used to capture droplet size distribution, velocity, and volume flux. The results differ remarkably in terms of breakup regimes and trajectory for biodiesel blends, which may be due to the high viscosity of biodiesel in comparison to diesel. For example, at a Weber number of 80, some bag breakups are observed on the biodiesel jet against the expectation that, at this Weber number, most of the liquids experience atomization mode.",29,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34853,"Combustion of a nonmetallized organic gelled droplet was studied using high-speed (5 kHz) hydroxide planar laser induced fluorescence. Monomethylhydrazine was gelled with 3 and 6 wt % hydroxypropyl cellulose and burned in a pressure vessel with 35–414 kPa of ambient air. Fuel jetting is observed during the combustion of the gelled droplets. Three distinct types of jetting events were observed for the first time: 1) jets that distort the flame front, 2) jets that break the flame front, and 3) jets that form a fire ball outside of the flame front. The average jet speed was the highest for type 3 and the lowest for type 1. Speeds and locations of the fuel jets were quantified. It was observed that the radial jet velocity increases with increasing gellant concentration and decreases with increasing ambient pressure. Also, jets were observed to occur at the same location repeatedly. A possible explanation is that the initial jetting event weakens the shell, causing more jets to occur at the weakened location. Understanding the fuel jets of gelled droplet combustion is important because they are likely to influence the oxidizer–fuel ratio, chemical equilibrium, gas-phase mixing, and droplet trajectory in gel spray combustion.",29,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34848,"Because of preliminary research that indicates composite solid propellants, featuring polymerized dicyclopentadiene as the binder, offer potential advantages over commonplace binders, polymerized dicyclopentadiene gumstock samples were evaluated to support development of their use as a composite solid-propellant binder. This was done through an investigation of processing behavior and mechanical characteristics. Because of dicyclopentadiene’s rapid and highly exothermic polymerization process, pot life experimentation was conducted to determine the effectiveness of bulk-mixture temperature and inhibitor concentration at retarding dicyclopentadiene’s polymerization reaction. Gelling agents were examined as a possible way to tailor dicyclopentadiene’s rheological characteristics as a potential means of correcting observed quality issues, such as binder loss and particle separation. Mechanical characteristics, such as surface hardness and stress–strain parameters, were investigated through the testing of polymerized dicyclopentadiene gumstock dog bones to assess the affect of aging, plasticizer type and concentration, gelling agent concentration, and copolymer networks. Also, density values were determined experimentally to fill a knowledge gap and for use in future trade studies. Based upon the results of these investigations, it is unlikely that polymerized dicyclopentadiene will function as a viable, widespread alternative for commonplace binders. However, polymerized dicyclopentadiene-based propellants may find a niche in small high-burn-rate motors, such as diverter motors.",29,6

The instrument was an oscillating-piston viscometer, modified and recalibrated at the National Institute of Standards and Technology with dodecane as a reference fluid over the full temperature and pressure range. Based on the recalibrations, the repeatability of the measurements was found to be approximately 3%, whereas the uncertainty of the instrument is estimated at 5%. The measured viscosities of RP-2 were compared with values calculated with a five-component surrogate mixture model developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The experimental data have a stronger pressure dependence than the mixture model and are up to 29% higher at high compressions.",29,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34942,"Two-dimensional planar and three-dimensional round nitrogen jets under supercritical pressures are simulated with a wide range of conditions to explore their unique characteristics. A high-order method using a sixth-order compact scheme is applied. The present study parametrically covers two supercritical pressures of 4 and 8 MPa and three jet injection temperatures between a cryogenic jet of 82 K and a warmer jet of 133 K. Unique characteristics are found in both the mean temperature and temperature fluctuation profiles on the centerline (i.e., slower increase of jet temperature and relatively weak temperature fluctuation), only in the case of a near-critical pressure of 4 MPa and a cryogenic jet of 82 K. For the condition, the temperature profile on the centerline uniquely consists of four characteristic regions. The other conditions show no distinct features. The present study suggests that the distributions of the specific heat capacity at constant pressure help to explain the generation of the unique temperature characteristics.",29,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34861,"The present study proposes a simple theoretical model for the hypergolic ignition of gel propellants. The model assumes that the ignition process is governed by the time it takes for the heat wave produced by the reaction to diffuse through the whole droplet, which is described by the classical conduction time constant. The proposed model is based on a prior work by F. A. Williams and is further developed. The results obtained exhibit realistic ignition times in the range of tenths of milliseconds that are in close agreement to those obtained in various experimental works.",29,6

This paper discusses a new composite propellant based on hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene–1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene binder. This solid propellant has been formulated and characterized. The results have shown a 35% increase in burning rate and density. In addition, they exhibited good mechanical and rheological properties over a wide range of temperatures (similar to hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene propellant). Based on the experiments carried out, this prepolymer seems promising as an energetic binder to increase the density-specific impulse for solid propellants and to substitute for both hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene and for recent energetic binders.",29,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34599,"A numerical investigation has been conducted to determine the effects of self-excited tip-leakage flow unsteadiness, upstream stator wakes, and downstream blade row interactions on the performance prediction of a low-speed research compressor rotor. Calculations included a single blade row rotor configuration as well as two multiblade row configurations: one in which the rotor was modeled with an upstream stator and a second in which the rotor was modeled with a downstream stator. Steady-state and time accurate calculations were performed using a Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes solver, and the results were compared with detailed experimental data at operating conditions corresponding to the compressor design point, near stall, and a midpoint between the two. Differences in the performance predictions between the three configurations were then used to determine the effect of the upstream stator wakes and the downstream blade row interactions. Results obtained show that for this compressor with rather large tip clearance time accurate calculations are a vast improvement over steady-state calculations, but the upstream stator wakes and the downstream blade row interactions have only a small effect on the numerical solution. In this paper, changes in the rotor flowfield due to the upstream and downstream stators are investigated and discussed to explain the limited impact of the stator wakes and downstream blade row interactions on this tip dominated flow. In addition, the unsteady nature of the rotor tip vortex at near stall conditions is discussed to explain the improvement of time accurate analysis over steady-state computations.",29,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34766,"The objectives of the present study were to investigate the effects of tip clearance on cavitation performance and flow characteristics in a turbopump inducer by using computational fluid dynamics. Three different tip clearances were analyzed under design and off-design ( and ) cavitating conditions. The Rayleigh–Plesset model was implemented in ANSYS CFX 13.0 by using rate equation controlling vapor generation and condensation in the context of two-phase one-fluid analysis to calculate the cavitating flows. Numerical results in this study were validated by comparison with experimental results for suction performance. Cavitation inception occurs at the leading edge of the blade tip. For high cavitation numbers, the static pressure under cavitating conditions is almost the same as that under noncavitating conditions because tip vortex cavitation and tip leakage vortex cavitation do not affect the flow significantly or deteriorate the overall performance. Tip vortex cavitation and tip leakage vortex cavitation tend to become large for small tip clearances at the low flow rate. However, long blade cavitation develops for large tip clearances and obstructs the throat between two adjacent blades; such cavitation results in head breakdown at high cavitation numbers for large tip clearances. Further, at the high flow rate, head breakdown occurs at high cavitation numbers due to abrupt obstruction at the throat by blade cavitation on the pressure side as well as on the suction side.",29,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34834,"The liquid oxygen–hydrogen J-2X rocket engine, which powers the upper stage of the NASA Space Launch System, is presently undergoing hot-fire testing. Analysis revealed numerous potential resonance issues with hardware in the turbomachinery flowpath, which could be catastrophic for the launch vehicle. This paper describes a series of probabilistic analyses incorporating nondeterministic characteristics of mistuning amplification, blade damping, natural frequency, and speed to assess the risk of failure of turbine blades due to resonance during past and present tests and to determine an appropriate value of damping to use in deterministic forced response analysis. The analyses are the first reported in the literature combining these critical nondeterministic parameters. The new damping determination technique developed here indicates that combining a damping value in the lower 1.5 sigma range with a 3 sigma mistuning amplification value results in a desired total 3 sigma probability of failure. These risk calculations were invaluable for determining high-cycle-fatigue margins of safety and in determining if risk-reduction methods such as dampers were necessary immediately, or if tests could be performed before risk-reduction hardware was ready.",29,6

Experiments are performed using an idealized model of a transonic tip flow. Schlieren photography, probe, and surface pressure measurements are used to determine the transonic tip flow structure and to validate the computational method. Computational simulations are performed to investigate the effects of cooling injection in a transonic blade environment.

15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34944,"Direct-connect wind-tunnel facilities that produce uniform flow entering the test section are generally used for scramjet-component (isolator/combustor) studies. In freejet experiments and flight tests, however, air enters the engine through an inlet, and flow entering the isolator and combustor is typically distorted. The distortion effects can include nonuniform boundary-layer thicknesses on the walls and relatively strong oblique shock waves. This research focuses on the effects of inlet distortion on a round scramjet isolator. A numerical study was performed using various distortion devices, including ramps, injector ports, and injector slots, that were placed downstream of the direct-connect facility nozzle to simulate a distorted flowfield from a prescribed inlet. The computational results provided a methodology for simulating flow distortion in direct-connect testing. Based on the numerical findings, experimental testing was conducted in the supersonic wind-tunnel facility to validate the numerical results and determine the impact of flow distortion. In addition, this paper focuses on design, fabrication, and execution of flow-distortion experiments. Air injection in the distortion section was used to create the flow distortion, and shock angle increases with the injection flow. Comparisons of wall pressure, exit flow profiles, and shock-holding capability are made from the experimental and numerical results. Good agreement between these data on wall pressures and flow profiles was found.",29,6
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34803,"A three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation solver has been developed to investigate the effects of backpressure on the flowfield unsteadiness, pseudoshock oscillation, and the velocity of the unstart shock wave in the hypersonic inlet isolator when the total temperature is 1800 K. The results showed that, when the ratio of backpressure to the freestream static pressure is 50, the whole flowfield can hold steady; as the ratio increases to 70, the flowfield turns unsteady, and the pseudoshock oscillates with a frequency of 3107 Hz; and when the ratio increases to 90, the inlet unstarts and oscillates with a frequency of about 597 Hz. The maximum amplitude of static pressure fluctuation occurs in the range where the leading-edge shock of the shock trains oscillates. The lower-wall pressure reaches its peak value when the first shock wave of the pseudoshock oscillates to its most upstream position and decreases to its minimum value when the leading-edge shock wave of the pseudoshock oscillates to its most downstream position. Besides the total temperature, the backpressure also affects the propagation speed of unstart shock wave; the greater the backpressure is, the quicker the unstart shock wave moves.",29,6

Miniaturized engines were fabricated from steel in three-piece configurations without a converging/diverging nozzle. Bismuth trioxide-aluminum generated 46.1 N average thrusts for 1.7 ms durations with a specific impulse of 41.4 s. Cupric oxide-aluminum generated 4.6 N thrusts for 5.1 ms durations with a specific impulse of 20.2 s. Convective and conductive reaction regimes were identified as functions of bulk packing density and confinement geometry. Average thrusts and burning durations differed by greater than an order of magnitude for equivalent nanothermites dependent on the reaction regime. Adding small amounts of nitrocellulose to the nanothermites increased specific and volumetric impulses to maximum values of 59.4 s and while controllably reducing average thrusts and prolonging burning durations. The energy-conversion efficiencies of the thrusters were evaluated using a rotary-arm measurement, and a maximum efficiency of 0.19% was observed.

18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34645,"An integrated approach for chamber pressure control and thrust distribution for multiple nozzles of a solid propulsion system is presented. In this study, a solid propulsion system with variable nozzle throat area controlled by a pintle actuator is considered. To keep the hardware configuration simple and lightweight, multiple nozzles share a combustion chamber. Consequently, changing the throat area of one nozzle results in an unintended change of chamber pressure and thrust from other nozzles. Therefore, pressure stabilization and thrust distribution for multiple nozzles should be conducted simultaneously to achieve the desired performance. For the inner control loop, an adaptive sliding mode controller with feedback linearization is used for pressure stabilization. With the pressure control loop working properly, a thrust distribution algorithm into 10 nozzles for translation and attitude maneuver is developed as an outer control loop.",29,6
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34778,"The multiple-use plug hybrid for nanosatellites prototype thruster is being developed to fill a niche application for nanosat scale spacecraft propulsion. The prototype thruster uses safe-handling and inexpensive nitrous oxide and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene as propellants. The thruster system provides attitude control using secondary-injection thrust vectoring and allows large-impulse and small-impulse attitude control and proximity burns to be performed with the same system. To ensure survivability during extended duration burns, the multiple-use plug hybrid for nanosatellites incorporates a novel regenerative cooling design in which the nitrous oxide oxidizer flows through a cooling path embedded in the aerospike nozzle, before being injected into the combustion chamber near the nozzle base. Digital manufacturing was used to fabricate the nozzle components. Fused deposition modeling was used to fabricate the solid fuel grain from the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene thermoplastic. When fully developed, the multiple-use plug hybrid for nanosatellites thruster could provide an enhanced propulsive capability that would enable multiple nanosatellites to be independently repositioned after deployment from the parent launch vehicle. Because the environmentally benign propellants are mixed only within the combustion chamber after ignition, the system is inherently safe and can be piggybacked on a secondary payload with very little overall mission risk increase to the primary payload.",29,6

The combustion characteristics of several silicon-based nanoenergetics were studied by performing equilibrium calculations, initial screening tests, and instrumented burn tube experiments. Results of constant pressure equilibrium calculations predicting adiabatic combustion temperatures and volumetric gas production are shown and the mechanisms that produce these results are discussed. For 14 of the 19 Si/oxidizer systems studied, such as Si/perchlorate systems, the predicted maximum adiabatic combustion temperatures are about 3000 K. For the materials considered the highest predicted combustion temperature is for the Si/polytetrafluoroethylene system at 3531 K, whereas the Si/metal oxide systems are predicted to have adiabatic combustion temperatures ranging from 2282 to 2978 K. The dissociation of to SiO was observed to limit predicted adiabatic combustion temperatures. Theoretical maximum gas production of the reactive Si composites ranged from 350 to , with producing the most gas and producing the least.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34910,"Computational fluid dynamics has been applied to the simulation of hybrid rockets using as the oxidizer and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene or high-density polyethylene as the fuel. Simulations have been carried out using predefined fuel and oxidizer mass flow rates, and calculating the fuel mass flow rate as a function of the wall heat flux. In this second case, the calculated regression rate has been compared to the average value derived from the reference experiments; no tuning coefficients have been introduced. Computational fluid dynamics results are compared with the corresponding experiments in the literature. In those tests where regression rate is calculated as a function of the wall heat flux, the fuel grain is divided into segments and its average value is plotted as a function of the average oxidizer mass flux in the combustion chamber. Computational fluid dynamics regression rate is underestimated by 30% for high-density polyethylene and 50% for hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene if only convective heat exchange is accounted for. For hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene at relatively low gaseous oxygen, the radiative heat transfer contribution to the total heat flux is not negligible, and this is confirmed by computational fluid dynamics: when radiative heat flux is taken into account, the error on regression rate is reduced to 15% and its value is overestimated. Computational fluid dynamics does not correctly predict regression rate modulus, but it correctly calculates the parameter of the regression rate formulation .",29,6

The theoretical formulation is based on a generalized wave equation. Normal mode expansion and spatial averaging techniques are implemented to solve for the acoustic motions in the chamber. Several specific effects of radial and circumferential baffles, and the mechanisms by which baffles eliminate combustion instabilities, are presented. Longitudinalization of transverse waves inside baffle compartments, restriction of velocity fluctuations near the injector face, and reduction in oscillation frequency are studied systematically. The effects of mean flow, temperature nonuniformities, and combustion response on the baffle design and stability behaviors are investigated. Potential destabilizing influences of baffles are found to be the concentration of acoustic pressure at the injector face and of acoustic velocity near the baffle tips, as well as their ensuing interactions with local combustion processes.",29,6

Results from the T-junction flow computations show that, for a for a critical flow velocity in the side branches, an acoustic resonance is excited. The reduced velocity at resonance was found to be in the range 1.5 to 1.7, which is in good agreement with experimental measurements. In addition, the pressure profile exhibits a node on the axis of the T junction with antinodes of opposite signs in the side branches. For the rocket-engine cooling manifold, results show that vortex shedding and pressure fluctuations within the manifold significantly influence the stability of shear layers and flow through exit cooling tubes.

By using various optical methods, including high-speed camera imaging, emission spectroscopy, and Mach–Zehnder interferometry, the plasma bulk velocity for different energy configurations of the SPPT-68 ADD SIMP-LEX is derived. Together with the total ablated mass and an improved slug model, the ratio of mass accelerated in the discharge process is computed and, thus, the propellant utilization efficiency is derived.
