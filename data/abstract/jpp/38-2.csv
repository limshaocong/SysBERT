0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38226,This work is an experimental demonstration of a novel resonant pulse combustor technology for which sustained pressure gain can be achieved at thermal equilibrium. The resonant pulse combustor employs an actively driven air inlet valve with passively modulated fuel injection such that the device operating frequency is specified by the valve set-point frequency. This configuration enables more control over the combustor operation compared to passive valve and valveless resonant pulse combustors and enables the durability necessary for consideration in practical applications. Combustor performance is characterized with measured stagnation pressure gain as a function of stagnation temperature and fuel mass flux. Steady-state stagnation pressure ratios between 1.005 and 1.025 are demonstrated for gaseous (ethylene) and liquid (gasoline) fuels at temperature ratios from 2.8 to 4.5. Baseline performance measurements for a well-studied passive valve resonant pulse combustor are presented for comparison. The proposed active valve technology provides a direct path for translation from research-type devices to practical gas turbine applications by addressing key challenges inherent of existing resonant pulse combustor technologies.,38,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38436,"This study systematically investigated the influence of the position and inclination angle of an externally mounted hollow cathode in 1.35 kW magnetically shielded Hall thrusters to establish the relationship between thruster performance, plume state, and cathode placement. For this purpose, a combined motor driver with a three-degree-of-freedom movement was designed to move the cathode over a wide range of positions and inclination angles. In an experiment performed on a thruster with outer magnetic columns, placing the cathode inside the magnetic separatrix resulted in a considerable amount of thrust. However, an extremely small distance between the cathode and thruster can cause a sharp increase in the discharge current; hence, the optimal cathode position should be determined. It was also found that a small inclination angle was favorable for obtaining high performance. In addition, a strong correlation was found between the plume image and thruster performance. Under improved performance conditions, the visible light region of the plume had a shorter axial length and a broader pink halo. Finally, a comparative experiment was conducted on a thruster with an outer magnetic shell. The thruster of this structure was observed to be insensitive to the cathode position; hence, to protect the cathode from ion sputtering, the distance between the cathode and thruster can be appropriately increased.",38,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38410,"The transition from the low-amplitude, aperiodic fluctuation to thermoacoustic instability is usually treated as a Hopf bifurcation, but the transition incorporates complex dynamical behaviors. Intermittent oscillations commonly occur in the transition process wherein chaotic states alternate with limit cycle oscillations and both the chaotic state and the limit cycle oscillation last with no fixed period. Intermittent oscillations that occur in the thermoacoustic system are demonstrated to be deterministic. A Koopman linearization procedure is implemented to model the intermittent combustion oscillations in the backward-facing step combustor. The nonlinear dynamics of intermittent combustion oscillations are approximated as a forced linear system in an orthogonal space, which is constructed by singular value decomposition of a delay coordinates matrix. The phase space of an intermittent combustion oscillation can be divided into linear and nonlinear regions by the magnitude of the nonlinear term in the forced linear system. As a result, intermittent combustion oscillations can be described as the transition between chaotic states and limit cycle oscillations, and the transition occurs when the nonlinear term is large.",38,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38417,"Low fuel regression rate is one of the major drawbacks of hybrid rocket motors. In this study, a novel injector concept is proposed to provide a substantial enhancement in the fuel regression rate. A tubular injector, Distributed Tube Injector (DTI), is inserted in the center of the cylindrical fuel port in order to tailor the oxidizer flow introduced into the combustion chamber with the desired combination of radial, tangential, or axial components of velocity. This concept has been tested using a 500 N thrust class hybrid rocket motor, which uses a paraffin-based fuel and supercharged (L) as the oxidizer. As a result of 30 hot firings conducted in the test program, it is determined that the DTI configuration provides regression rates up to 3.9 times higher than the regression rates obtained using fore-end injector commonly employed in conventional hybrid rockets. Using the motor test data, a comprehensive nondimensional and scalable regression rate relation has been established. This nondimensional regression rate equation can be used to design the internal ballistic configuration of hybrid rocket motors using the novel injector.",38,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37878,"It has been urgently required to develop ionic liquid electrospray thruster (ILET) for rapidly expanding micro-/nanosatellites. In this work, ILETs with high-density array emitters are fabricated to quantitatively study the electrospray emission process of three typical ionic liquids (ILs). Onset voltage, current, voltage–current characteristics, and ratio of positive to negative currents are analyzed, and the effect of the properties of ILs on ILET is revealed. The onset voltage of the ILET is measured to be as low as 740 V, and the collected current is up to . The results show that the viscosity of ILs has a great influence on the onset voltage and the emitted current. The inconsistency between theoretical and experimental results for the onset voltage of different ILs is explained in detail. Taking viscous stress into account, the estimated results agree well with the experimental ones. The analysis shows that the dynamic effect will be significant when the viscosity is high. In addition, the voltage–current characteristics and the ratio of positive to negative current are studied. The research is valuable to get insight into generative mechanism of IL electrospray and to provide a better design of both ILs and ILET.",38,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38004,"Distributed aircraft propulsion has renewed the interest in power-dense, high-efficiency power packs. Ceramic turbomachinery could be a major enabler, although no successful design has been achieved in microturbine rotors. Rotor blade loading is tensile and a hurdle for successful conversion to ceramics. The inside-out ceramic turbine (ICT) rotor uses the superior compressive properties of monolithic ceramics by supporting ceramic blades against a structural composite rotating shroud. This enables low stress levels throughout the blade, increasing reliability and extending service life. An experimental demonstration of two ICT designs was conducted with 15-kW scale prototypes to identify critical issues: design A, a flexible hub that clamps blades against the structural shroud and design B, a sliding-blade configuration that allows free displacement of the blade. The flexible-hub design was tested up to . Rotor integrity was preserved, but local blade cracking occurred. The sliding-blade design was successfully tested up to for over 1 hour at a tip speed of with no issue. Tensile loading at the ceramic/metallic interfaces remains the key challenge to address. Reducing friction should overcome blade cracking and allow the proposed ICT to reach the targeted temperature of and tip speed of .",38,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38241,"In this study, impact of the port diameter and length changes of a solid fuel on its performance parameters was investigated to propose design considerations for the solid fuel for hydrogen peroxide/high-density polyethylene hybrid rockets. A laboratory-scale hydrogen peroxide/high-density hybrid rocket was designed to perform a parametric study of the solid fuel through experiments. The ratio of the nozzle throat area to the fuel port area and ratio of the fuel length to the fuel port diameter were used to design the port diameter and length of the solid fuel. Altering the fuel port diameter affected the characteristic velocity efficiency, oxidizer mass flux, velocity-based erosive burning, oxidizer-to-fuel ratio, and regression rate. Altering the fuel length affected the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio and characteristic velocity efficiency and had little effect on the regression rate because it did not significantly contribute to the change in the oxidizer mass flux. No improvement was observed in the characteristic velocity efficiency after the ratio of the fuel length to the fuel port diameter reached 20. Finally, design considerations for the port diameter and length of the solid fuel for a hydrogen peroxide/high-density polyethylene hybrid rocket were suggested based on the experimental results considering the changes in the ratio of the nozzle throat area to the fuel port area and ratio of the fuel length to the fuel port diameter.",38,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38393,"This study investigates the application of an exhaust gas energy harvesting hybrid powertrain to three general aviation aircraft with reciprocating spark-ignition piston engines. The hybridization process involves downsizing the internal combustion engine to save weight and installation of an exhaust heat harvesting system composed of a harvester, a generator, lithium-ion traction battery, an electrical conversion system, and an electric motor. Novel calculations for a hybrid powertrain performance envelope are presented that estimate the upper limits to the degree of downsizing and mass of the harvester. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has been proposed as a potential compact, high-efficiency harvester. Five hydrofluroolefins (which have no ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential) are considered as organic fluids for the ORC. It is found that R-1336mzz(Z) performs best in this application. Each ORC design parameter is investigated, and an optimized design with 14.3% thermal efficiency is found. At this efficiency, the internal combustion engine may be downsized up to 34.5%. The fuel burn reduction at this degree of downsizing may be as high as 12.7–14.5%.",38,2

Beside alternatives as ammonium dinitramide-based propellants, hydroxylammonium nitrate-based mixtures, or high concentrated hydrogen peroxide, mixtures of fuels with nitrous oxide called HyNOx or NOFBX represent promising green propellants. Compared to classical , mixtures offer a higher performance ( and ), no or low toxicity, and low propellant costs. To investigate the handling and performance of a propellant mixture consisting of and ethene, hot gas combustion tests with an experimental combustor were conducted. This paper summarizes the results of 134 combustion tests conducted with the premixed propellant injected in gaseous state. Calculated and measured performances ( and ) depending on mixture ratio, characteristic combustion chamber length , and chamber pressure are shown and discussed. Furthermore, the residence timescales of the propellant mixture inside the combustion chamber are normalized by the chemical timescale of the combustion process. Thus, combustion efficiencies depending on dimensionless Damköhler numbers are derived.",38,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38421,"We conduct a high-speed visualization of coolant liquid film dynamics inside a 10N-class bipropellant thruster using monomethylhydrazine and a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide as propellants at equivalent conditions with the flight model. The direct visualization of the liquid film inside a quartz glass chamber demonstrates the transient dynamics of film flow from ignition to cutoff for the first time. The scenario for the life of the film flow is found as follows: the coolant fuel jet impinges on the chamber wall being the liquid film; the friction force from the chamber wall rapidly decelerates the film as one-tenth of the injection velocity; next, the film moves sheared by the fast combustion gas downstream; and eventually the film completely evaporates by heat transfer from the hot combustion gas. The liquid film presents the typical ripple wave structure, covered by the velocity and thermal boundary layers. The effect of the mixture ratio is significant as the film flow rate increases at a small mixture ratio, leading to the longer film length.",38,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38330,"Spectral analyses were performed on high-speed video of three nitrous-oxide/paraffin-based hybrid rocket launches and one static test fire of a nitrous/paraffin-based hybrid rocket motor. The imagery was taken to assess the combustion stability and identify any dominant instability modes. A spectral analysis of the image luminosity signals has shown distinct oscillatory modes in the plume flowfield. The plume oscillations have been compared and linked to existing hybrid combustion instabilities reported in the literature and theoretical predictions. The use of high-speed imagery has proven useful as a nonintrusive method of gathering high-frequency data in the analysis of hybrid combustion during launch. Analysis of high-speed imagery from a static test has revealed the time-varying aspect of the dominant oscillatory modes. The first longitudinal acoustic mode, identified in all data sets, has been used in a novel way to determine the characteristic velocity of the operating motor.",38,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37808,"The results of measurements of the three-dimensional flowfield in a low-speed single-stage compressor operating in deep rotating stall are presented in this paper. The measurement technique includes a specially designed omnidirectional five-hole pressure probe, a specially designed near-wall hot-wire probe, high-frequency pressure transducers, and oil flow visualization. The test results provide a detailed description of the flow in and around the stall cell. The flow pattern of the cell is described by velocity vectors, streamlines, and pressure contours. A definition of the stall cell is proposed by using the streamlines in the frame of reference of the stall cell. Upstream of the rotor, the stall cell is characterized by a reversed jet flow at the rotor’s tip and downstream flow at the midspan and hub. Downstream of the stator, the stall cell is composed of low-speed wake flow with circumferential flow near the shroud from the trailing edge to the leading edge of the stall cell.",38,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38434,"Nuclear (fission, fusion, and hybrid fission/fusion) propulsion systems promise dramatic reduction in trip times for numerous interplanetary destinations. Pulsed fission, fusion, and fission/fusion hybrid systems require significant instantaneous power to initiate the nuclear reactions, usually stored and delivered by capacitor banks. For such systems, pulse recharge circuits are necessary for extracting some power from the microexplosions, leaving the remaining thermal and kinetic energy in the plasma available for generating thrust. This paper presents a study of such a circuit based on flux compression generation. Results using a 1-D plasma model suggest a system where the extracted energy for a high-gain system requires a small fraction of the initial plasma energy, leaving the remaining energy for thrust. The researchers demonstrate a low specific energy and high specific power with the proposed design. Based off these results using the simplified 1-D model, the complexity and cost of using a full 3-D model that includes kinetic and fluid effects may be justified to further explore this concept. At a high level, this design reduces some uncertainty over previous designs, making pulsed nuclear propulsion more feasible, enhancing, and enabling missions throughout the solar system.",38,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38492,"A diaphragm can be installed inside a hybrid motor to enhance the fuel regression rate and combustion efficiency in hybrid rockets. However, significant pressure oscillations have been observed in such motors. This paper describes an experimental investigation of the mechanism that triggers the instability in the presence of a diaphragm. Lab-scale firing tests under various experimental conditions and combustion visualization tests are conducted to identify the instability mechanism. The excitation source of the pressure oscillations is found to be the periodical impingement of vortices on the rigid rear diaphragm, a phenomenon known as the hole-tone instability. Large pressure oscillations occur in hybrid motors with diaphragms due to the resonance between the natural frequency of the hybrid motor system and the excitation frequency of the hole-tone instability. Finally, a new grain design without a diaphragm, named the “stepped grain” configuration, is proposed to mitigate the excitation source of the instability. The regression rate of this stepped grain design is noticeably higher than that of a cylindrical single-port grain configuration under stable combustion.",38,2
