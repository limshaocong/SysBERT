The thrust was measured using an inverted pendulum-type thrust stand. The anode power, propellant flow rate, and magnetic field were systematically varied in order to understand the impact of each parameter on the performance, which was characterized in terms of specific impulse, thrust, and thrust efficiency. At 200 W of anode power, the specific impulse of the device reached a maximum value of 860 s, and the thrust reached 3.2 mN. The thrust efficiency was modest, and it reached a maximum value of 4.6%. However, the thrust efficiency was found to depend strongly on the strength of the magnetic field. The quad confinement thruster device investigated in this study was limited to a maximum magnetic field of 250 G. Further improvements to the device can likely be achieved by applying much stronger magnetic fields.",30,6

The importance of different reaction mechanisms, such as charge exchange, electron impact ionization, and electronic excitation with metastable atom formation and radiation, is analyzed for conditions typical for field-reversed configuration thrusters. The flow conditions include neon gas and plasma with densities on the order of , plasma temperatures between 5 and 10 eV, and relative plasma–neutral velocities up to . Then, an implicit particle-in-cell code, Celeste3D, extended to include all relevant plasma–neutral and neutral–neutral elastic and inelastic processes and Coulomb collisions, is applied to study the neutral entrainment. The model includes a planar flow between a field-reversed configuration plasmoid initially at a Schmid–Burgk equilibrium and neutral gas with varying relative velocities, plasma temperatures, and neutral gas densities. The contribution of charge exchange, electron impact ionization reactions, and collisional radiation is analyzed, and the sensitivity of the entrainment efficiency to the plasmoid translation velocity and neutral density is evaluated.",30,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35131,The pulsed plasma thruster of the magnetoplasmadynamic type represents a promising and cheap solution to today’s propulsion challenges in space. The work presented in this paper covers new information on the electromagnetic conditions during thrust generation by revealing the temporal and spatial distributions of the current density vectors between the thruster electrodes. This is achieved by building and calibrating miniaturized induction probes. The local magnetic field components of all three spatial directions are combined to derive the current density vector. Quantitative determination of the temporal behavior of vectors at 27 points evenly distributed in three planes delivers a comprehensive picture of the position and development of the current in a pulsed plasma thruster. Maximum current densities of and magnetic flux densities of up to 0.82 T have been observed close to the surface of the solid Teflon® propellant. It is concluded that no distinct movement of a current sheet was observed. The current density data are discussed and compared to high-speed camera photographs.,30,6

The Aerojet Rocketdyne T-140 laboratory-model Hall effect thruster, operating at a discharge voltage of 300 V, a discharge current of 5.16 A, and an anode flow rate of , serves as a representative Hall effect thruster testbed. The nominal facility operating pressure during thruster firings is torr, corrected for xenon. Two , square aluminum plates are placed adjacent to, but electrically isolated from, the walls of the stainless-steel vacuum chamber at two locations with respect to the center of the thruster exit plane: 4.3 m axially downstream along the thruster centerline and 2.3 m radially outward centered on the exit plane. The plates are configured in three distinct electrical configurations with corresponding measurements: 1) electrically grounded plates with measurements of currents to ground, 2) electrically isolated plates with measurements of floating voltages, and 3) isolated but electrically connected plates with measurements of the current conducted between them. The measurements are all taken simultaneously, with the discharge current oscillations of the thruster at a sampling frequency of 100 MHz. Measurements of the current conducted to ground in the electrically grounded configuration reveal that the axial and radial plates collect ion currents that are 13.6 and 10.7% of the discharge current, respectively; the collected current is coupled to the discharge current oscillations but is smaller in magnitude and phase delayed. In the electrically connected-plate configuration, 5.5% of the average discharge current is observed to flow from the axial plate to the radial plate, driven by a floating voltage difference of 7.6 V; this current is uncorrelated in time with the discharge current oscillations. These results indicate that the vacuum chamber conducts current and is a recombination site for a significant number of plume ions during Hall effect thruster operation.",30,6

The propulsion with small fission bombs is excluded because the critical mass requirement leads to extravagant small fission burnup rates. This leaves open the propulsion with nonfission ignited thermonuclear microexplosions, with a compact fusion microexplosion igniter (driver) and no large radiator. It should not depend on the rare isotope and only requires a small amount of tritium. This excludes lasers for ignition. With megaamperes of gigavolt proton beams and a small amount of tritium, cylindrical deuterium targets can be ignited. The proton beams are generated by discharging the entire spacecraft as a magnetically insulated gigavolt capacitor. To avoid a large radiator, needed to remove the heat from the absorption of the fast neutrons in the spacecraft, the microexplosion is surrounded by a thick layer of liquid hydrogen, stopping the neutrons and heating the hydrogen to a temperature of , which as a fully ionized plasma can be repelled from the spacecraft by a magnetic mirror.",30,6

The laser was operated in burst mode varying the pulse repetition frequency, single-pulse energy, and number of pulses in a burst. The burst was repeated until the impulse reached saturation. A torsion pendulum was used to measure the total impulse generated in a single burst with an accuracy higher than 2%, even with a 1 s burst period.

Based on detailed computational fluid dynamics simulations and sensitivity analysis, multiobjective design optimization is conducted for a tandem impeller. An optimized tandem impeller, for which the objectives are all better than those of the baseline, is fabricated and tested on a high-speed centrifugal compressor rig. The numerical results show that the baseline tandem impeller has more uniform discharge flow but lower efficiency than the corresponding splitter impeller. The geometries of the inducer blade profile and inducer–exducer gap are found to have the greatest impact on the tandem impeller efficiencies. By optimization, the tandem impeller efficiency can be increased through reduced curvature of the blade profile at the inducer hub, S-shaped blade angle distribution at the inducer tip, and increased blade angle at the exducer tip near the leading edge. The measured performance of the centrifugal compressor with the optimized tandem impeller agrees well with the computational fluid dynamics calculations, and the compressor peak efficiency is 0.796 at the design speed (45,000 rpm).",30,6

The computational grids that are generated in general consist of multiblock, point-matched structured grids. For the cooling flow control tubes, heat transfer pedestals, and interblade row leakage slots, the computational grids are embedded, multiblock, overset grids to allow for arbitrary placement to allow optimization without the need for regridding the entire domain. The techniques used to construct the geometry and various computational grids are described. Demonstration of the procedure is provided for a one-and-a-half stage film-cooled turbine and a single-stage compressor.

This paper computationally investigates the effects of tip injection on tip leakage vortex dynamics in an unshrouded turbine, in an attempt to seek new loss generation mechanisms in turbine tip clearance flows and to influence them by the injection. First, a linear cascade validation is introduced, and the computations are compared with the experimental data to identify the ability of computational fluid dynamics code to predict the tip leakage flow. The tip leakage vortex breakdown phenomenon and dynamics analysis are shown, and then the effects of tip injection on leakage vortex structure and vortex breakdown characteristics are investigated. Also, the effect of leakage vortex breakdown on aerodynamic performance of the turbine with injection is examined. Results indicate that the leakage vortex breakdown occurs when the pressure rise is large enough in the rear part of the blade suction side near the tip, and it is an important loss mechanism associated with tip leakage. Injection location has a different impact on the leakage vortex dynamics, dependent on the tip pressure field characteristics. With injection in the front part, the leakage vortex breakdown is delayed, where the turbine achieves the best performance improvement, and the vortex breakdown location moves downstream as the injection mass flow rate increases.",30,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35229,"Cavitation surge is a system instability that occurs in pumping machineries in which the unsteady characteristics depend on system components such as the pipe length. On the other hand, under typical boundary conditions of numerical simulations of internal flow, it is supposed that a uniform flow extends infinitely upstream and downstream from the boundaries. Therefore, a numerical simulation of the influence of the pipe length of fluid machinery cannot be realized just by changing the position of a boundary of the computational region. In the present study, a boundary condition that takes into account the pipe length was used to numerically simulate unsteady cavitation in a three-blade cyclic cascade. The resulting cavitation surge frequency became lower when the upstream pipe length becomes longer, which is consistent with previous findings. Also, the resulting cavitation surge frequency showed good agreement with empirical frequencies of the actual cavitation surge of pumps, although the empirical frequency is a rough prediction because it covers various system components. Additionally, the theoretical frequencies were predicted by estimating quasi-steady and local cavitation compliances from the present results. The theoretical frequency takes into account the upstream pipe length. As a result, local cavitation compliance was relatively effective for prediction of the theoretical cavitation surge frequency.",30,6

The pulsed-detonation combustor is inherently unsteady, and time-resolved measurements are required to identify unsteady flow processes at the turbine inlet and exit. In this study, the radial turbine of a Garrett automotive turbocharger was coupled directly to and driven, full admission, by a pulsed-detonation combustor fueled by hydrogen or ethylene. Full-cycle time-resolved turbine inlet and exit pressures were obtained from pressure transducers mounted to wall static pressure ports. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy was used to obtain full-cycle time-resolved turbine inlet and exit temperatures and velocities. Optical access permitted the use of high-speed video for particle streak velocimetry to obtain time-resolved turbine inlet velocities during blowdown with a 20 Hz ethylene-fueled pulsed-detonation combustor with 0.9 fueled fraction and 0.5 purge fraction. A comparison of laser-based and video-based measurements was made for the blowdown portion of the pulsed-detonation combustor cycle. First-ever full-cycle time histories of turbine inlet and exit velocities, total temperature, total pressure, mass flow, and total enthalpy rate revealed reflected pressure waves and showed momentary reverse flow, and thus unsteady accumulation and expulsion of mass and enthalpy.",30,6

Multicavities were used to stabilize and enhance the combustion in the supersonic combustor. Supercritical kerosene at temperatures of approximately 780 K was prepared using a heat exchanger driven by the hot gas from a preburner and injected into the combustor at equivalence ratios of 1.0. Static pressure distribution in the axial direction was measured along the centerline of the model combustor top walls. A high-speed imaging camera was used to capture flame luminosity and combustion region distribution. In the experiments, combustor performances with different injection locations, injection stages, cavity locations, and numbers of cavities were investigated systematically. The experimental results showed that the injection penetration and local combustion had a strong coupling with the upstream flow. The combustion region and heat release distribution changes obviously due to the various cavity-injection schemes, and the combustion performance could be improved when the injection location and distribution of supercritical kerosene mass flow rate were optimized.",30,6

However, current simulation methods for predicting the thermal radiation in a flight scramjet combustion chamber have yet to be validated with experiments. An experimental measurement apparatus is placed at the rear exit of the HIFiRE 2 direct-connect rig at NASA’s Langley Research Center. An array of photodetectors gather emission in the infrared along several lines of sight across the combustor exit. The fields of view are simulated using a ray-tracing-method program that postprocesses a computational fluid dynamics flowfield simulation of the test rig.

The interaction between shock and combustion is modeled by a strength-adaptable model in the isolator, named the “X shock.” An iterative procedure is implemented to solve the precombustion shock and the flow properties downstream. The calculation of the combustor is based on a series of governing equations where the effects of area change, friction, and mass injection are included. The release of energy is obtained from a fuel-mixing model or pregiven heat release distributions estimated from experimental results.

15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35195,"Particle image velocimetry measurements were made along the center plane of a scramjet cavity flameholder to analyze simulated inlet flow distortion in the direct-connect test environment. Mach 3 nonreacting tests examined an oblique shock impinging upon locations in- and upstream of the cavity, including cases with wall-normal air injection upstream of the cavity to simulate fuel injection. Addition of flow distortion altered the size and shape of the primary recirculation region within the cavity by deflecting the bounding shear layer: the recirculation region was compressed by shock impingement upstream of the cavity, and shock impingement on the cavity itself expanded it. Air injection upstream of the cavity thickened the shear layer and produced a stronger effect on velocity direction than magnitude, preventing the formation of a large-scale recirculation region in two of the three shock locations studied. Flow distortion and upstream air injection both increased flow unsteadiness, with the greatest increases occurring in the shear layer and above the cavity closeout ramp. Additionally, results suggest the formation of spanwise secondary flow patterns that may account for flow nonuniformities observed in prior studies. This work presents the first velocimetry characterization of a scramjet cavity flameholder under distorted-flow conditions.",30,6

An ethylene fuel jet is injected into the model scramjet that is autoignited by high-enthalpy flows compressed and decelerated by a train of shock waves and boundary layers developing in the scramjet isolator/combustor. The ethylene flame behavior is captured by a high-speed movie camera through optical access windows on the model and characterized by surface pressure/temperature traces recorded at five different locations along the flowpath through the model scramjet. Downstream pressure buildup due to combustion heat release, shock-induced compression, and mass loading via the fuel jet triggers the flame propagation toward upstream, stabilizes the flame at a location in the combustor, or pushes the flame further upstream to cause inlet unstart. In particular, flame dynamics while the scramjet undergoes the inlet unstart with Mach 4.5 freestreams are investigated intensively. In addition, stagnation temperature, overall fuel concentration, and oxygen concentration in freestream flows are varied to investigate their influences on the flame dynamics.

Results for product temperatures and column densities offer insight on the ongoing combustion process downstream of fuel injection throughout the combustion-product plume, and on the significant temporal variations in the combustor. Additional tests measure the temperature and concentration of in the cavity flameholder during a flame extinction event, which gives an upper bound of the cavity residence time.

An important step toward this goal is the development of dynamic models for shock system motion inside the inlet isolator under varying flow conditions. In this paper, shock motion models are developed based on fast-response pressure measurements made along the wall of the isolator (straight channel) downstream of a Mach 1.8 nozzle. The shock system can be perturbed by changing the stagnation pressure with an upstream valve and/or by changing the backpressure with a downstream flap. In particular, the shock’s transient dynamics are modeled, which govern the unstart process and are induced by changing pressure-boundary conditions, by employing system identification techniques. The result is a partially nonlinear dynamic model that reveals the possibility of partitioning the nonlinear behavior from the linear dynamics with relative ease. A second dynamic model is then generated, where the nonlinear portion has been prespecified, leaving only the linear portion to be determined by system identification. The modeling and identification process specific to the experimental unstart data used are discussed and successful models are presented for both the full system identification and the partitioned model cases.",30,6

Numerical results, as well as streakline analysis, showed that a large-scale vortex over a diaphragm interfered with the existing vortices near the surface. The growth of the small-scale vortices was suppressed until a large-scale vortex shed in the downstream pseudoperiodically. In addition, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis revealed that inserting a diaphragm decreased the energy content in the primary flow mode and reallocated flow energy in lower modes 2–5.

Angular distributions indicate the broadening of both the beam current and mass distribution for increasing flow rates. As the flow rate increases from 0.30 to , derived thrust and specific impulse change from and 200 s to and 80 s, respectively.",30,6
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35189,"A procedure for generating metamodels for calculating composition and properties from chemical equilibrium of reacting mixtures is presented. The procedure is novel because, in theory, it allows prediction of equilibrium quantities independently of the fuel and mixture parameters, such as equivalence ratio or fuel-air ratio. The resulting surrogates may find direct use in the analysis of thermodynamic cycles and the computations of flowfields requiring properties of combustion products. The present approach is justified by the formulation of the method of element potentials, a class of methods for the solution of chemical equilibrium problems.",30,6
