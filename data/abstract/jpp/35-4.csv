0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37395,"Under rocket-relevant conditions, real-gas effects and thermodynamic nonidealities are prominent features of the flow field. Experimental investigations indicate that phase separation can occur, depending on the operating conditions and on the involved species in the multicomponent flow. During the past decades, several research groups in the rocket combustion community have addressed this topic. In this contribution, a high-fidelity thermodynamic framework comprising real-gas and multicomponent phase-separation effects is employed to investigate liquid-oxygen/methane and liquid-oxygen/hydrogen flames at high pressure. A thorough introduction and discussion on multicomponent phase separation are conducted. The model is validated with experimental data and incorporated in a reacting flow computational fluid dynamics code. Using one-dimensional counterflow diffusion flames, the thermodynamic states and processes are discussed. Both real-gas and phase-separation effects are present and quantified in terms of derived properties. Finally, the method is applied in a three-dimensional Large-Eddy Simulation of a single-element reference test case, and the results are compared to experimental data.",35,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37195,"In this experimental study, a new data reduction approach was developed for measuring droplet burning rate constants that automatically finds the most linear part of the -squared curve for the longest period of time. The approach, here called , was developed in response to the observation that burning rate constants can vary by up to 10%, depending on the reduction approach used, especially for fuel types such as nonvolatile simple hydrocarbons and kerosenes. To evaluate this new method, burning rate constants were measured for 10 fuels, including two alcohols, four simple hydrocarbons and four kerosene blends. The measured rates ranged from 0.74 to , typically grouped by similarities in thermophysical properties of the fuel types. Notably, and its simpler equivalent yielded burning rates with small statistical uncertainty ( average) across all fuels and were associated with the highest coefficient of determination for all measurement approaches, indicating that these two methods are viable options for improved consistency in measuring burning rate constants. In addition, a systematic method is presented for measuring ignition delays using a short-duration plasma source for ignition. The ignition delays ranged from 65 to 110 ms for most fuels, correlating well with the fuel boiling temperature. Combined, this work provides baseline data and data reduction tools suitable for future droplet combustion studies.",35,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37136,"The numerical simulation of the ignition process of the monomethyl hydrazine–nitrogen tetroxide attitude-control thrusters is difficult because of the complex hypergolic gas–liquid chemical reaction between the propellants. To calculate the thruster ignition delay accurately, a 36-step gas-phase chemical kinetics model and a one-step finite-rate liquid-phase hypergolic reaction are proposed. These chemical mechanisms are integrated into the Euler–Lagrange-based transient spray combustion simulation platform. The calculated ignition pressure curve of a 2 kN thruster coincides well with that from the experiment. The numerical and experimental ignition delays are 2.4 and 3.1 ms, respectively. A parameter study shows that the liquid-phase reaction at the propellant impingement points consumes 22–44% propellant and provides energy to heat the gas mixtures, which is essential for a successful gas-phase ignition. The lower limit of ignition delay was estimated as 1.5 ms under design restrictions for most thrusters.",35,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37437,Combustion of aluminum droplets released by the solid propellant is widely used to increase the thrust in solid rocket motors. The combustion dynamics of the released droplet cloud in the unsteady flow is however susceptible to trigger thermoacoustic instabilities. A theoretical analysis is conducted to determine the heat release rate fluctuations produced by the burning droplet cloud for small acoustic disturbances. Two contributions to heat release fluctuations are identified. The first originates from fluctuations of the evaporation rate due to the oscillating flow around the droplets. This leads to local fluctuations of the volumetric rate of heat release within the droplet cloud. The second one originates from the motion of the boundary of the burning droplet cloud at the end of the combustion process. This motion is due to droplet lifetime oscillations leading to an additional source of heat release disturbances. Both contributions to heat release disturbances take place within the acoustic boundary layer along the solid propellant surface. Quasi-steady models for the response of the droplet diameter fluctuations and droplet velocity fluctuations are derived. Combined with a model for the gas velocity fluctuations within the acoustic boundary layer they lead to expressions for the resulting heat release rate disturbances within the droplet cloud and at its boundary. Results are compared to a previous low order model and to numerical flow simulations. It is shown that the new model leads to close agreement with simulations over the entire flow. The derived expressions yield a better understanding on heat release disturbances and can be used to predict the linear stability of a solid rocket motor at reduced computational costs.,35,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37409,"This Paper reports on organometallic composites, containing nanoscale aluminum and lithium-based hydride fuel particles, as solid propellant additives. Theoretical performance is evaluated for bimodal metal propellant formulations containing capped fuel additives (nanoMetallix LLC) and aluminum. Replacing aluminum with nanoMetallix capped fuel additives reduces specific impulse, adiabatic flame temperature, condensed-phase products, and hydrochloric acid. Combustion behavior is investigated using high-speed video techniques, including flame emission, laser backlit configurations, and a two-camera ratiometric bandpass emission technique used to detect lithium. Agglomeration behavior of the nanoMetallix particles at atmospheric pressure is similar to nanoaluminum (nAl), producing large aggregates that ignite quickly, increasing radiative heat feedback. Spectrally filtered video identifies lithium vapor around the nanoMetallix particles on and above the burning surface, suggesting lithium vapor is released close to the surface. Pressurized burning rate measurements indicate nanoMetallix-based propellant burning rates are up to approximately 14% higher than similar nAl-based propellants at and below 6.89 MPa. Above this pressure, nanoMetallix propellants exhibit plateau pressure dependence, likely an effect of the different capping agents used. This Paper shows organically-capped nanoscale particles are a promising alternative to nano/microaluminum in composite solid propellant formulations.",35,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37331,"Combustion models of different fidelity are applied to a seven-element gaseous methane/oxygen subscale rocket combustion chamber. The covered region of thermo-chemical states is analyzed for two non-adiabatic flamelet-based methods, from which one is well established and the other one has just recently been proposed for hydrogen/oxygen combustion. Of particular interest is their applicability in situations with strong heat losses. Consequently, the tabulated combustion models are linked with a presumed probability density function approach, and the results are assessed using a transported probability density function method. An analytically reduced chemical reaction mechanism with 13 species and 73 reactions is used for all models in order to allow for direct comparison of turbulence–chemistry interaction. The results are evaluated with respect to temperature, gas composition, and wall heat transfer and they are brought in context with their respective computational costs. Finally, the results are compared to available experimental data in terms of wall heat flux and pressure measurements. Locally and temporally resolved results provide additional insights to the experiment.",35,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37405,"The influence of an absorber ring on the acoustics of a rocket combustion chamber is studied numerically and experimentally under nonreacting conditions. The transverse split modes that occur upon application of the absorber ring are evaluated in terms of their eigenfrequencies, damping rates, and mode shapes from numerical calculations. Thereby, a systematic variation of the resonators’ impedance is carried out to capture the structure of the eigensolutions. An analytic model for the absorber ring impedance is used to obtain predictions for certain absorber specifications. Based on numerical single resonator simulations, a modification of the absorber model is proposed. The results are validated with experimental data for different absorber lengths. The numerical approach consists of an eigenvalue analysis of the linearized Euler equations in frequency space. Good agreement is obtained for the predicted eigenfrequencies in which the absorber model modification significantly improves the trends of the eigenfrequency development via absorber length.",35,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37420,"This study aimed to conceptually introduce a novel method of dual-mode operation of nontoxic hypergolic thruster using decomposition gas of hydrogen peroxide and to experimentally assess the technical feasibility of the concept. An engineering model of a 500-N-scale nontoxic hypergolic thruster was tested with a nontoxic hypergolic combination that consisted of hydrocarbon fuel (“stock 3”) and 95 wt % as an oxidizer. Technically, dual-mode operation involves transition from a bipropellant mode to a monopropellant mode, or vice versa, which can provide great flexibility in terms of the deep throttling of the thrust level and the suppression of chugging instability at low thrust levels. The phase change of the oxidizer played a key role in the dual-mode operation. In particular, through hot-firing tests, system instabilities related to the mode transition were experimentally investigated. It was also confirmed that deep throttling of the thrust level was feasible through the mode transition.",35,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37384,"This work presents highly resolved Navier–Stokes simulations in a cylindrical solid rocket motor. The study focuses on the vorticoacoustic interactions and their role on motor stability. This paper proposes comparisons between simulations and available theories on unsteady axial velocity but also radial velocity, pressure, temperature, and entropy. Overall, the agreement is excellent except for pressure, which is found to be purely acoustic in simulations (i.e., no vortical pressure). The role of radial velocity is further investigated because it gives rise to the rotational correction term in stability integrals. This paper shows that this term strongly depends on the definition of the propellant admittance, and it can actually be viewed as a part of the classical propellant pressure-coupled response. This study has also estimated damping terms directly by studying the decay of pressure perturbations in simulations and has compared them to classical stability integrals from theory. In keeping with the aforementioned results, the agreement is much better when rotational correction and vortical pressure terms are dropped.",35,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37306,"Composite powders combining boron with and were prepared using mechanical milling. As-received amorphous boron and boron initially washed with acetonitrile to remove the hydrated surface oxide were used as starting materials. In the prepared composite powders, each particle was a dense agglomerate of primary, nano-sized boron particles coated with metal fluorides. Reactions occurring upon heating in both aerobic and anaerobic environments were characterized using thermoanalytical measurements and mass spectroscopy. Powders were ignited on an electrically heated wire. Ignition sensitivity of the powders to electrostatic discharge was found to be low. For composite powders prepared using commercial boron, low-temperature reactions catalyzed by hydrated boron oxide occurred upon heating, leading to formation of gaseous boron fluorides. At high heating rates, such reactions led to ignition at very low temperatures. The exothermic reaction kinetics and ignition temperatures for such powders were not affected by the fluoride oxidizer. For composites using boron washed in acetonitrile, exothermic reactions began at higher temperatures. Respectively, such powders ignited at higher temperatures. For powders using washed boron, both kinetics of the exothermic reactions and ignition temperatures were affected by the type of fluoride: materials using reacted and ignited at temperatures lower than those using .",35,4

The theoretical model is validated by comparisons to experiments of a wide range of geometries and operating conditions showing very good agreement. The produced expressions quantify contributions from electromagnetic and gas dynamic acceleration; confirm, explain, and generalize trends observed by experiments; and offer additional guidelines for thruster improvements.",35,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37394,"Methane has many possible advantages as a fuel for reusable rocket engines and is therefore extensively discussed. However, the characteristics of methane as a coolant in a regenerative cooling system are widely unknown. Especially the heat transfer deterioration that occurs in the vicinity of the critical point is a major concern and a severe drawback. To investigate this phenomenon and to establish a broad data basis for the validation of numerical simulations, tests were performed with a subscale combustion chamber. The combustion chamber contains different cooling channel geometries (rectangular cooling channels with the aspect ratios [height-to-width ratio]: 1.7, 3.5, 9.2, and 30) and was cooled with cryogenic methane. Results close to the critical point show a distinct maximum in hot gas wall temperature, which is a clear evidence of heat transfer deterioration. The test results indicate a strong dependency on the occurrence of this effect toward cooling channels with a low aspect ratio.",35,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37309,"Rotating detonation engine (RDE) fuel injector response was characterized in a lab-scale linear testing platform. The experimental design consists of a linear extrusion of an RDE cross section and allows rapid interchanging of modular, 3D printed inlet geometries. An array of helium jets was established within a channel, and a single combustion-driven shock pulse was presented at one end. The subsequent injector interruption and recovery were quantified using high-speed acetone planar-laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). A quartz wall provided optical access to the channel and the injector response was visualized at up to 30 kHz. Three dynamic pressure transducers allowed the shock strength to be quantified along the length of the channel. Timescales associated with jet interruption and recovery were determined by analysis of instantaneous PLIF images and considered in conjunction with the dynamic pressure measurements. Results are presented as a function of pertinent nondimensional parameters and compared with available experimental and computational data in a full, research-scale RDE.",35,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37463,"Understanding the nature of the unsteady flow at the combustor exit is required to accurately simulate time-dependent phenomena in the turbine entry, such as indirect noise generation. Using large-eddy simulations of the combustion process in a realistic geometry, the flow at its exit is analyzes. Two realistic near-ground certification operating conditions are considered. Different mechanisms for large-scale flow and thermal structure generation are described, which are ejected into the turbine. Modal decomposition methods are used to extract the spatial and temporal scales at the turbine entry. It is found that, depending on the operating condition, the entropy waves convect as elongated streaks in the core of the combustor annulus or the proximity of the walls. The dominant unsteady character of the fluctuations exhibits different spectral properties: that is, low frequency in the core and high frequency toward walls. At the combustor exit, the vortical field is dominated by the swirl in the air inlet, which is found to have little influence on the entropy perturbations. Furthermore, the importance of considering the interaction of multiple fuel injectors and combustion zones in an annular combustor is investigated. It is shown that pulsating circumferential vorticity modes can occur in multisector annular combustors, but these do not affect the entropy wave distribution.",35,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37200,"This current study presents a detailed analysis regarding three-dimensional separation flows controlled by steady and oscillating boundary-layer aspirations installed on suction surfaces of highly loaded planar compressor cascades. The influences of the oscillation parameters on the control effects are parametrically investigated with the objective of providing guidelines to determine the control parameters. The susceptibility to varying the aspiration locations as well as the control expenses of the steady boundary-layer suction methods are significantly improved due to the introduction of periodic oscillations into the aspirating flows. The effective excitation frequency spans a relatively wide bandwidth (from to ) only if the amplitude exceeds a threshold value . Through a detailed comparative analysis on the steady and oscillating aspiration cases, the most prominent spatial change led by the oscillating aspiration is manifested by fully discretized separation vortices. These newly formed spanwise vortex tubes enhance the momentum exchange between the main flow and the recirculation zone, and hence alleviate the corner separation. Despite the increased local loss production caused by the increased vortical strength, the overall cascade performances are improved from a temporal average perspective. With the aid of the proper orthogonal decomposition method, the formation process of the discretized separation vortices is explored. It is found that the periodic disturbances originating from the suction slot are amplified, subject to the adverse pressure gradient and rollup, to form a series of vortical structures in the separated layers.",35,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37037,"Recently, multiple authors have investigated the use of additive manufacturing for precision fabrication of hybrid rocket fuels. Extensive regression rate data for 3-D printed motors with thrust levels from 5 to 900 N, using both thermoset and thermoplastic feed-stock materials, have been collected. A class of printed thermoplastics based on acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene was discovered to present unique burn characteristics not been previously observed with many legacy hybrid rocket-fuel materials. These printed thermoplastics are shown to produce fuel regression rates that strongly correlate to motor diameter, with smaller motors tending to burn strongly fuel rich with time. This burn behavior contrasts with the known burn behaviors of most thermoset hybrid fuels whose regression rates are only weakly dependent on motor size. Nearly all thermoset hybrid fuels tend toward a lean oxidizer-to-fuel ratio as burn lifetime progresses. To describe the anomalous behavior of 3-D printed thermoplastics, an extension to the classical Marxman regression rate model was developed to account for radiant heat transfer to the material surface. The model extension is empirically verified in this report and demonstrates that observed anomalous behaviors of certain 3-D printed thermoplastics result from dominant radiant heat-transfer mechanisms that are less significant for traditional hybrid fuel materials.",35,4
