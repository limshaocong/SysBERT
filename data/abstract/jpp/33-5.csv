0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36215,"The design optimization of aircraft engines considering their integration with the airframe has been limited by challenges with existing propulsion modeling tools. Gradient-based optimization with derivatives computed using adjoint methods has been successful in solving aerodynamic and structural shape optimization problems but has not yet been applied to coupled propulsion–airframe optimization, partly because existing tools lack analytic derivative computation. As a step toward obtaining a full cycle analysis with efficient analytic derivative computation, a new chemical-equilibrium thermodynamics solver is developed for propulsion applications. This solver provides a continuous formulation that enables analytic derivative computation using a coupled adjoint approach. The results from this solver are verified against a well-established chemical-equilibrium code. The analytic derivatives are also verified by comparing them with finite-difference approximations. The performance of the analytic derivative computations is tested using two optimizations: combustion temperature maximization with respect to equivalence ratio, and combustion temperature maximization with respect to air pressure. The results show clear speed and numerical stability benefits when comparing the proposed method against finite-difference approximations. It is now possible to use this new solver as the foundation for further development of a complete propulsion analysis for integrated propulsion–airframe design optimization.",33,5

Existing poststall airfoil data and the corrections used in acquiring them are critiqued. Uncertainties in the existing data that are large enough to impact on vertical-axis wind turbine startup modeling are established, with wind-tunnel blockage identified as a potential cause of the discrepancies. Using a conventional closed-section wind tunnel with blockage corrections applied to data and a passive, tolerant test section design, tests are conducted on five NACA 0015 airfoils with a range of chord lengths. The passive tunnel is found to be better at minimizing the effects of blockage, and it makes no use of correction formulas that are not strictly applicable when flow is separated because they are based on potential flow theory. Preliminary results are presented from a study varying Reynolds numbers and showing little variation in poststall performance for the NACA 0015 in the range of Reynolds numbers from to .",33,5

For practical reasons, current experimental rotating detonation engine designs include separate streams of fuel and air injected into a detonation channel. Experimentation with a fully premixed rotating detonation engine has repeatedly failed due to flame flashback into the premixed plenum. That fundamental problem is the subject of this paper: understanding the relevant principles and parameters that contribute to flashback and investigating a scheme for arresting the flashback phenomenon. This investigation quantifies the flashback susceptibility for a proposed rotating detonation engine feed slot with parameterization of channel height, channel length, equivalence ratio, fuel type, and feed pressure. The design principles of quenching distance and critical boundary-layer velocity gradients are shown to describe the safe operation region to deliver a safe premixture of fuel and air to a rotating detonation engine when adjusted for experimental conditions and applied in unison. This research leads to a design that is capable of avoiding flashback while enabling detonation to occur in a rotating detonation engine.",33,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36076,"The present paper focuses on the simulations of the flow behavior and the structural analysis for a high-speed compressor at the transition time between stall and surge. Two cases are presented; the first case is for the compressor with its original design unchanged, and the other case is for the compressor controlled with air injection at the vaneless area. The case of the compressor with air injection was studied aerodynamically and discussed in detail in a previously published paper done by the authors of the current presented work. Results showed that the stall effect is relatively higher at the impeller exit near the shroud surface due to the interaction between the main flow and the secondary flow, which causes strong pressure and velocity fluctuations at this area. Results also indicated that the forces and moments for the case of the controlled compressor are lower than those for the uncontrolled compressor during stall and surge. The blades tip surface deflection is maximized at the moment of the maximum pressure in the surge cycle, and the most dangerous region at the deformed blades tip surface is located at the transition area between the axial and radial blade profile. Results also showed that the deformation of the blades at the tip region can be limited by changing the shaft bearing stiffness.",33,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36269,"The particle-based coupling between background gas flows in vacuum test facilities and neutral ingestion into Hall effect thrusters is investigated. An analytical model of the facility background flow environment is developed to accommodate facilities with different geometries and pump placements, as well as compute the ingested flow rate of background neutrals into a given Hall effect thruster. The ingested flow rates computed by the model are shown to predict previous empirical datasets taken using the 5 kW P5, the 6 kW H6, and the 1.5 kW SPT-100 Hall effect thrusters in different test facilities to within the experimental uncertainty. When compared to predictions generated assuming ingestion by the random flux of neutral particles, the ingested flow rates computed by the background flow model are shown to be 40 to 70% closer to the empirical measurements without requiring any semiempirical inputs. It is also shown that the neutral ingestion at a fixed facility pressure can vary by as much as 91%, suggesting that background pressure magnitude is an insufficient parameter for fully describing neutral ingestion effects. These results indicate that the developed analytical background flow model is an effective predictive tool for computing neutral ingestion into Hall effect thrusters.",33,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36326,"The effect of velocity ratio and recess on the mixing characteristics of gas-particle swirl and shear coaxial injectors was investigated. The concentration and mixing efficiencies of the particles and gas were measured by planar nephelometry based on Mie scattering and acetone planar laser-induced fluorescence methods, respectively. The mixing mechanism and mixing efficiency of the shear and the swirl coaxial injectors were compared with and without recess. The results showed that the mixing efficiency of the former was higher than that of the latter in the case without a recess because the swirling momentum of the coaxial gas did not change the particle concentration half-width. The mixing efficiencies of both injectors in the case without a recess were sensitive to changes in the velocity ratio. However, in the case of injectors with a recess, the mixing efficiency of the swirl coaxial injector was higher than that of the shear coaxial injector because the internal interaction of two propellants led to an increase in the particle concentration half-width, and the mixing efficiency of the swirl coaxial injector was less sensitive to changes in the velocity ratio than that of the shear coaxial injector.",33,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36510,"The present paper describes the phenomenon of hard start observed from a demonstrator of 500 N scale nontoxic hypergolic thruster using high-test peroxide as an oxidizer. When 90% concentration of hydrogen peroxide was used, the hard start was observed even under the fuel lead operation. To effectively suppress the occurrence of hard start phenomena in the startup phase of the thruster, oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio and concentration of hydrogen peroxide have been individually considered. In drop tests, the ignition delays of hypergolic reactions became longer in the oxidizer-rich condition than those measured in the fuel-rich condition. By regulating oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio with deliberate control of the oxidizer mass flow rate, the thruster operated smoothly even using 90% high-test peroxide in the fuel-rich environment. Furthermore, without the utilization of the flow control device, the thruster successfully operated when higher concentrations of high-test peroxide (95 and 98%) were used under the fuel-rich condition.",33,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36321,"This paper presents a description of the physical principles of aerodynamic power savings from boundary layer ingestion propulsion and a quantitative evaluation of the boundary layer ingestion benefit for advanced civil aircraft. Control volume and one-dimensional analyses are used to illustrate two major features of boundary layer ingestion: reduction of jet mixing losses due to decreased jet kinetic energy from reduced velocity of flow entering the propulsor and, to a lesser extent, reduction of airframe wake mixing losses. Embedded boundary layer ingestion propulsion systems can also enable nacelles with reduced surface area and associated weight and drag, further decreasing the aircraft propulsive power requirement. The required propulsor flow power is shown to decrease with increases in both the amount of boundary layer ingested and the propulsor mass flow, and there is thus no unique way to compare boundary layer ingestion and non-boundary-layer-ingestion systems. Using the ideas presented, however, the benefit can be assessed for any given comparison. The analysis is applied to an advanced civil transport aircraft concept with 40% of the fuselage boundary layer ingested, yielding a reduction in required propulsor mechanical power of 9% relative to a non-boundary-layer-ingestion configuration with the same propulsors, in agreement with computational fluid dynamics calculations and wind tunnel experiments.",33,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36341,"An experimental investigation is carried out to characterize the flow through a shallow single serpentine curved convergent nozzle with an aft deck under fully expanded and underexpanded conditions with nozzle pressure ratios ranging from 1.1 to 2.2 for cold flows by wall static pressure measurements and flow visualization of the exit jet. The study revealed initial deceleration of the flow due to the turning of the streamlines caused by the nozzle curvature. Asymmetric coefficient of pressure variation in the cross-stream direction across various nozzle pressure ratios was observed, which is caused by secondary flow created by wall curvature and transition. The acceleration of the core flow due to geometric transition, as well as the additional nozzle length, causes early transition to sonic and supersonic flows, resulting in the formation of shock cells at relatively lower Mach number in the absence of the aft deck, as can be seen from the schlieren images. However, the presence of the constant area extension section reduced the flow asymmetry. Furthermore, the presence of the aft deck prevented the formation of barrel shocks and is expected to prevent the formation Mach disk(s) at higher nozzle pressure ratios. Thus, the curvature, transition, and aft deck complemented each other.",33,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36306,"Pressure losses and mixing effectiveness are key parameters in the performance of an injection system suitable for scramjet engines. This work thus focuses on the characterization of the total pressure losses associated with two selected vortex interaction processes in a Mach 2.5 flow in order to better understand the role of vortex dynamics in the operation of scramjet combustors. Specifically, the interaction modes are targeted to obtain merging of two corotating vortices in one case while preventing it in the second. The streamwise vortices are shed from ramps placed on the surface of a strut mounted in a cold-flow supersonic wind tunnel. In-stream pitot and total temperature measurements are conducted at two downstream streamwise stations located within a shock-free region. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry is used in conjunction with the intrusive measurement techniques to retrieve the local Mach numbers and the total pressure in the flows of interest. The losses are quantified through the pressure loss parameter. It is found that the main contribution to the momentum deficit in the wake is given by the shocks departing from the strut rather than by the vortices, with the merging case yielding slightly higher losses.",33,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36190,"This paper presents a low-order model applying the immersed boundary method on smeared geometry. It is thus able to represent the effect of turbomachinery within a complex system. Assessment of this model on the NASA rotor 67 has been made under clean flow conditions. Good agreement has been achieved between the immersed boundary method on smeared geometry model, experiments, and a high-fidelity computational fluids dynamics model. For high-speed conditions, about within 0.5, 1, and 1% agreements are achieved on the pressure ratio, efficiency, and choking flow, respectively, between immersed the boundary method on smeared geometry model and the experiment. The capability of the model capturing the fan’s behavior under inlet distortion has also been assessed under the flow with a level of 10% distortion of the total pressure, which covers a 120 deg sector. The nonuniform work input of the fan, which is one of the key features of the fan–distortion interaction, has been captured by the immersed boundary method on smeared geometry model. Finally, the model also helps to shed light on the physical understanding of fan–distortion interaction. It provides evidence suggesting that the tangential pressure gradient is one of the mechanisms causing the induced nonuniform work input of the fan subjected to the inlet distortion.",33,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36263,"Highly active aluminum nanoparticles are currently needed as a component in propellants. A hybrid spray method was used the HT (stating in this paper that the HT was cured in a mass ratio of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene to 2’4-toluene diisocyanate) to coat the surface of highly active aluminum nanoparticles, as accomplished in a xylene suspension. As indicated, HT coating can be completely carried out to form high-quality assemblies in micrometer scale, which can prevent circumambient oxygen from infiltrating and reacting with the active aluminum nanoparticles while favoring the preservation of the assemblies for a long term. The existence of voids or holes in the assembled aluminum nanoparticles could reduce density and improve the combustion thermal efficiency in a propellant. The flowability of the HT-coated assemblies evidently increases in comparison to that of original aluminum nanoparticles. Related mechanisms have been investigated and discussed. In terms of quality and content of highly active aluminum nanoparticles in the assemblies, the potential applications could be realized by the hybrid spray process.",33,5

Treatment of propellant injection and the balancing of pressure and mass flow through the engine are presented. A focus is placed on the identification of the parameters that drive performance in a rotating detonation device, such as deflagration of reactants, while noting those that have little impact, which include reduced detonation velocity due to lateral area relief. A thermodynamic description of the rotating detonation engine is proposed, using traditional cycle analysis methods in an effort to develop an initial design and performance tool for such pressure gain combustion devices.",33,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36434,"The influences of inlet geometry modification on flow and combustion dynamics are experimentally investigated in a model supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) installed in Mach 4.5 high-enthalpy air freestreams. The inlet upper-lip angle (6, 12, and 20 deg) and the intake contraction ratio (1.3 and 1.9) chosen as the generic inlet design parameters are varied. With the inlet geometries systematically modified, flowfields inside the model scramjet are visualized at cold conditions (room temperature) using a planar laser Rayleigh scattering method (wherein laser radiation is scattered by carbon dioxide particles). In addition, combustion dynamics and structures in the scramjet combustor are investigated in high-enthalpy flows with a total temperature of 2600 K capable of autoigniting injected fuels. High-frame-rate time-averaged chemiluminescence (broadband) imaging and hydroxyl planar laser-induced fluorescence are used for this investigation. Incident shock-wave strength, separated flow behavior, boundary-layer development, combustion structure/anchoring, and chemiluminescence intensity are found to be sensitive to the inlet geometry modifications.",33,5

A focus is given in this work to identifying the relationship between the appropriate flow variables to facilitate comparison between geometries and the experimentally obtained specific impulses and specific thrusts, as well as an examination of stagnation pressure usage, through corrected thrust. A tradeoff space is found in the performance of the engines in which the fuel efficiency and effective usage of feed stagnation pressure can be exchanged. Operation on both hydrogen and gaseous hydrocarbon fuel is presented. A comparison is made between the resulting propulsive performances found for similar rotating detonation engine geometries.",33,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36004,"Increasingly stringent requirements on fuel economy and emissions are propelling turbocharging technology to improve the power density of engines. In the future, turbocharged engines with ultrahigh-power density must be equipped with high-pressure compressors. However, the narrow stable operating range of a compressor at a high-pressure ratio is always a restriction. The variable-geometry method, which refers to the combination of a variable-inlet prewhirl and variable diffuser vanes in this paper, will be a preferred choice for the range extension of compressors, and so estimating its potential for range extension is of long-term value. This paper investigated the performance of a centrifugal compressor adopting the variable-geometry method via a steady three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation. The combination of variable diffuser vanes, ranging from to 10 deg, and a variable-inlet prewhirl, ranging from to 60 deg, has the potential to improve the stable operating range from 23.5 to 63.0% at a pressure ratio of 4.8. The corresponding increase in the low-end engine torque is estimated to be 53%. The combination shows advantages in terms of operating range and efficiency performance over only adjusting the diffuser vanes or simply changing the inlet prewhirl. The contributions from the variable-inlet prewhirl and variable diffuser vanes to the shifts of the surge line and choke line are discussed as well.",33,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36463,"In this paper, experimental results of an aluminized fuel-rich propellant having energetics similar to boron-based fuel-rich propellant and having no residue after combustion are discussed. Using this aluminum-based fuel-rich propellant, which has higher density than the current fuels used for hypersonic flight, this paper looks at enhancing the Mach number envelope of a ramjet. Nondimensional thrust and drag calculations were carried out to identify the air–fuel ratio required for a Mach 6 flight, with different intakes accounting for different pressure recovery. Calculations were carried out with three different intakes, and it was observed that, even with the lowest pressure recovery of 9% at Mach 6, a hypersonic mission was possible. Values for various efficiencies were chosen with great care, and a perturbation analysis was carried out to make the calculations more robust. The specific impulse obtained with the aluminum-based fuel-rich propellant in ramjet mode was 515 s at a 25 km altitude. Comparison of an aluminum-based fuel-rich propellant in ramjet mode was made with a kerosene and hydrogen fueled scramjet from the specific impulse data available in the literature. The specific impulse of the aluminum-based fuel-rich propellant was nearly an order of magnitude higher as compared to a hydrogen fueled scramjet when adjusted to the density of hydrogen. Upon considering a system size, it was also shown that the aluminum-based fuel-rich propellant could meet the burn rate requirement for a Mach 6 flight.",33,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36221,"This work augments the classical linear swirl injector dynamics theory to evaluate the hydrodynamic frequency response characteristics of a single element as an analysis aid for experimental results from cold flow testing. Specific focus is placed on how surface waves within the swirl injector are modeled. A modified formulation of wave interactions within the vortex chamber includes disturbance origins displaced from the posterior wall of the injector. Differing phase delays in both downstream and upstream directions are accounted for by dispersive calculations valid at all frequencies rather than by the traditional long wave approximation. The model is semiempirically tailored to hydraulic conditions for a study element, and a response function analysis is presented for an example case. Distinct features in the range of 2000–4000 Hz are found to be predominately related to surface wave patterns within the injector’s vortex chamber. Comparisons are made to experimental data, showing qualitative agreement with injector response and detection of computed high-frequency surface wave responses. Calculations are then mapped over steady mass flow conditions that range from 39 to 89% of the injector’s nominal design point. The results show that response features associated with surface wave dynamics consistently manifest across the entire parameter space investigated for the study injector element.",33,5

The experimental dataset is obtained in a comprehensive wind-tunnel campaign on a novel full-scale model of a helicopter fuselage section. In the wind-tunnel tests, engine mass flow rates corresponding to realistic helicopter operating conditions are reproduced. For fast forward-flight conditions, five-hole pressure probe data in the aerodynamic interface plane as well as local surface pressure distributions are compared with the data obtained by unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Regarding the corresponding numerical sectional fuselage case, all components of the wind tunnel model and the essential wind tunnel parts are comprised. To assess the influence of the truncation of the fuselage, an additional full fuselage case is investigated. A good agreement of the numerical simulations and the wind-tunnel data is achieved. The investigation of the side intake geometry yields a distorted total pressure distribution in the aerodynamic interface plane with regions of high and low total pressures. The origin of the aerodynamic interface plane total pressure distribution is explained in detail, analyzing the flow topology in the inlet region and the engine intake duct.",33,5
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36207,"The combustion behavior of paraffin-based hybrid rocket fuels with gaseous oxygen as an oxidizer has been analyzed in detail. Regression rate tests have been done in a two-dimensional radial microburner at the DLR, German Aerospace Center and at the Space Propulsion Laboratory. Fuel samples have been characterized by viscosity measurements, tensile tests, and a differential scanning calorimeter. Tensile tests showed significant improvement in maximum stress and elongation when polymers in low concentration were added to the paraffin samples. The values of the liquid fuel viscosities differed significantly between the selected fuels. This affected the droplet entrainment process during combustion and the regression rates of the fuels. The entrainment and regression rate increased for the decreasing fuel liquid layer viscosity. An exponential relation has been found between the liquid fuel layer viscosity and the regression rate, which can be used to predict the regression rate of new liquefying fuels by measuring their viscosity.",33,5

The propellant was tested in uniaxial tension, using a conventional approach, and also in a dynamic mechanical analyzer, using a dual cantilever beam mode. While the results were similar, the dynamic mechanical analyzer required less material, resulted in reduced variability, and was not sensitive to the applied strain. The quantity of material required was on the order of grams, so that results were obtained with small amounts of propellant, as compared to the conventional uniaxial tension test that requires material quantities on the order of kilograms. Some important considerations also discussed include the verification of strain independence before testing and the loosening of clamps between temperatures during testing.",33,5

22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36368,"Supercritical combustion has attracted significant interest due to its applications in high-pressure combustion devices. Validation of supercritical combustion modeling, however, has not been well reported because of the lack of experimental data with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution as well as the complexity associated with modeling and simulations. The present work begins to bridge this gap with a systematic examination of gaseous combustion of a shear coaxial injector at supercritical conditions, using both large-eddy simulation and detached-eddy simulation approaches. The formulation accommodates the full conservation laws and real-fluid thermodynamics and transport theories. Turbulence/chemistry interactions are treated by means of the flamelet and flamelet/progress-variable approaches. A nonpremixed jet flame (Sandia flame D) was first considered for code validation at ideal-gas conditions. The gaseous combustion at supercritical conditions was then studied systematically using different combinations of turbulence closure and combustion models. Special attention was given to comparison with measured wall heat flux. The large-eddy simulation/flamelet, detached-eddy simulation/flamelet, and large-eddy simulation/flamelet/progress-variable approaches produced qualitatively similar results in terms of flow and flame structures as well as wall heat flux. The present work was also compared with studies conducted by other research groups.",33,5

Dual-thrust rocket motors have a variety of designs; however, the one with intermediate nozzle yields high thrust ratio as well as a stable operation. Motivated by the shortage in related studies, the present paper is intended to shed more light on the topic of dual-thrust rocket motors with intermediate nozzle. The paper discusses the results of a set of static firing tests on a developed test motor covering all modes of motor operation. It is found that the thrust ratio can be maximized if the pressure difference across the intermediate nozzle is minimized. If the flow through the intermediate nozzle is initially reversed, a risk of motor damage should be taken into account.",33,5
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36413,"High-energy short-duration spark igniters are common in combustion devices where the discharge often occurs in a nonfueled region. This requires convection between where the spark kernel is created and where combustion can begin. Here, a reduced-order model is developed to study an ignition kernel in conditions similar to a gas turbine combustor. The kernel is generated in air and entrains ambient fluid into the reactor to model such observed fluid dynamics in a parallel set of experiments. Continuous dilution with cold reactants and endothermic fuel decomposition reactions are shown to compete with heat release in the entraining kernel. Simulation results also reveal a pressure influence on the kernel’s initial energy density and entrainment that can exceed the direct dependence of the reaction rates. A Monte Carlo perturbation approach is directly input to simulations, resulting in ignition probabilities that are directly comparable to experimental results. A computationally efficient support vector machine is trained in multiple ways with simulation results and used to quickly classify ignition success. Including the statistical variation of input parameters, the simulated ignition probabilities match the experimental results, indicating the capability of this approach for predicting ignition probability in non-premixed combustors.",33,5
