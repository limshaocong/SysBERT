The sprays that result have good penetration and lateral dispersion characteristics, and are suitable for fueling high-speed air-breathing propulsion systems. In this study, the flow within aerated-liquid injectors featuring both inside-out and outside-in aeration schemes is simulated using an implicit large-eddy simulation method equipped with a sharp phase-interface-capturing technique and a continuum model for surface tension. Results are compared with time-averaged and time-resolved X-ray measurements of liquid-phase density and imaging obtained at the 7-BM beamline at Argonne National Laboratory using beryllium injector models. A good agreement between computational predictions and experimental measurements is generally achieved, with each indicating that the end state of the aeration process for both injector designs is the formation of a core-annular two-phase flow in the nozzle portion of the injectors. The numerical model is less successful in predicting the structure of the separated two-phase flows observed before the expansion of the mixture through the nozzle. One-dimensionalized liquid-phase density, velocity, and momentum flux distributions obtained from the numerical model and the experiment display a close agreement for all injector configurations.",35,6

In this work, the aluminum–silicon (Al–Si) eutectic alloy, which has a lower melting point (577°C) than either constituent, was evaluated as a potential solid composite propellant fuel. Equilibrium calculations showed that Al–Si-based propellants had slightly lower theoretical ideal performance to equivalent aluminum-based propellants, with a typical specific impulse reduction of roughly 2.5 s for most mixture ratios of interest. However, if product agglomerate size could be reduced, improved performance could result. Neat and composite Al–Si/polymer powders were studied in solid propellant formulations. Burning rate experiments were performed in a windowed pressure vessel, and condensed phase combustion products were collected. It was found that the Al–Si-based propellants followed the same trends (burning rate exponent) but at a lower magnitude (burning rate coefficient) as neat aluminum-based propellants. However, the coarse product agglomeration of the Al–Si-based propellants was found to be larger than the neat aluminum-based propellants, which may be due to the high fluidity of Al–Si eutectic alloy.",35,6

Once lateral offset between the axis of the laser beam and the center of the sphere is generated, lateral force is generated to recede the offset. In this study, a pulsed Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet laser beam of a doughnut-shaped cross section is focused on a 10-mm-diameter aluminum sphere. The impulse components, parallel and lateral to the laser beam, are first investigated experimentally using a pendulum method. As a result, the ratio of the doughnut beam radius to the target radius is found to have a major impact on the impulse. For a relatively small value of at 0.56, at atmospheric pressure, the impulse is enhanced due to the focusing of the toroidal blast wave, whereas the shock focusing effect is negligible for a larger value of at 0.86. On the other hand, must be larger than 0.83 to generate the restoring lateral force.",35,6

The laminar flame speeds of the pyrolysis gases were measured using a constant-pressure chamber by outwardly expanding spherical flames and compared with theoretical values. Both the hydrocarbon classes and the pyrolysis temperature play important roles in defining the composition of the pyrolysis gas. Specifically, variations in the gas composition can be ascribed to disparities in the thermal cracking of different hydrocarbons. Laminar flame speeds decreased in the order of . The flame speeds obtained from C12 pyrolysis gases initially increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature and then gradually decreased, peaking at 560°C. The presence of highly reactive hydrogen and ethylene was found to significantly enhance the laminar flame speed, and so the normalized flame speed varied linearly with increases in the concentrations of these two species. The remaining species exhibited a nearly linear inhibitory effect. Finally, the C/H ratio of the pyrolysis gas played an important role in determining the adiabatic flame temperature and laminar flame speed.",35,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37424,"Properly determining the size and predicting the performance of a Hall-effect thruster (HET) is an essential process in the early phase of thruster design. In this paper, the scaling relations for a sub-kilowatt HET were derived in the form of linear equations from the physical relationships and the approaches found in previous studies. Because the anode power and voltage are major constraints in thruster design, the equations were given as a function of those parameters. The linear coefficients in the proposed scaling equations were determined from linear regression analysis on the test data from low-power HETs that consume less than 1.35 kW. A large discrepancy was shown between the coefficients and the values obtained from test results from a wide power range due to the losses in small thrusters. A low-power HET that consumes 360 W and applies 300 V at the anode was designed on the basis of the proposed relationship. To validate the thruster design using the proposed relations, the thruster was tested and the results showed that the measured thrust fell within the 95% prediction band.",35,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37402,"In the present Paper, the simulation of the flow inside an experimental rocket thrust chamber is undertaken. The combustor’s injector consists of seven individual coaxial injector elements, while the chamber and nozzle segments are water cooled. The results presented in this Paper are obtained with three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations using an adiabatic flamelet formulation for the chemistry modeling. The main focus is placed on examining the effect of the different turbulence models on the flame structure and on the resulting pressure and wall heat flux. The obtained numerical values are compared to experimental measurements, delivering good agreement in the heat flux profile at the combustion chamber wall and a slight underestimation of the pressure profile of approximately 2.5%. Greater discrepancies are observed in the heat flux of the nozzle segment but are largely attributed to the experimental setup. A conjugate heat transfer simulation of the structure and cooling channel flow confirms this assumption, and results for both one-way and two-way couplings are shown. It is demonstrated that a one-way coupling between hot gas and structure is sufficient due to the low sensitivity of the wall heat flux on the wall temperature. The azimuthal variation of the heat flux is also examined, and interestingly the heat flux showcases a local minimum at the position directly above the injector element. It is shown that an increased concentration of colder fuel-rich gas directly above the injector due to a strong vortex system leads to the local minimum in heat flux values and is strongly influenced by the injector/injector interaction near the face plate.",35,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37643,"Considering the need for accurate vaporization rates in the propellant combustion models, sublimation and vaporization rates of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) have been estimated over a wide range of temperatures. Simultaneous thermal analysis was carried at various slow heating rates, 5, 10, and 15°C/min, using a coupled TGA/DSC-FTIR system. In the solid phase, the mass loss occurs mainly due to the sublimation of RDX, whereas, in the liquid phase, both vaporization and thermal decomposition play a significant role. The extent of thermal decomposition was estimated using a computational model based on a recently developed detailed liquid-phase decomposition mechanism for RDX. For each of the heating rates, a suitable match between computational and experimental mass loss and species evolution profiles was achieved. As evident from the FTIR data, a major part of the mass loss occurs because of the evolution of decomposition products, such as , , , NO, HCN, , CO, and . Results show that vaporization accounts for 29.6, 34, and 35.9% of the total mass loss for the 5, 10, and 15°C/min heating rates, respectively. Relatively more RDX vaporizes at higher heating rates because of the initiation of the boiling phenomenon at higher sample temperatures.",35,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37448,"Analysis and testing of a ducted rocket employing a hybrid gas generator is presented. Over 150 successful static firing tests have been performed using a connected pipe facility supplying vitiated air to the ram combustor at stagnation temperature and pressure encountered in actual flights. The hybrid gas generator consisting of paraffin wax and gaseous oxygen operated unchoked, supplying hot, fuel-rich gases to the ram combustor for further burning with air. Empirical correlation of the fuel regression rate versus oxidizer mass flux in the gas generator has been displayed, and good overall combustion efficiency has been revealed. Thrust and fuel/air ratio control via the cold oxidizer flow rate into the gas generator is a major advantage of employing a hybrid gas generator. It was shown that such control could be done over broad ranges of flight altitude, flight Mach number, and thrust, while maintaining the ram pressure throughout the engine. This is in contrast to the thrust control of a ducted rocket employing a fuel-rich solid propellant. In that case, the process involves variation of the gas generator nozzle throat area by a mechanical device within the hot flow, implying a large increase of pressure in the gas generator combustor. Different scenarios of engine control and thrust modulation for variable flight conditions and requirements have been demonstrated.",35,6

This paper summarizes the main design features of porous injectors and proposes a mechanism of atomization for porous injectors that is considerably different to the atomization mechanism for coaxial injectors. The results of hot-fire test campaigns are presented, in which several parameters relevant to the injection process were varied: the injection velocities and momentum fluxes, the combustion chamber Mach number at the beginning of the nozzle contraction, and the LOX injector diameter. All hot-fire tests were conducted at P8 test facility for high pressure combustion research at the DLR site of Lampoldshausen with 50-mm-diameter combustion chambers operated with at sub- and supercritical chamber pressures between 30 and 100 bar. The results presented here are supporting the proposed mechanism of atomization and allow derivation of some general design guidelines for porous injectors.",35,6

The modeling aims at generalizing a practical use of the fuel regression model to improve, by means of numerical simulations, the knowledge about aerothermochemical phenomena in hybrid rocket engines. The present study focuses on the analysis of the turbulent boundary layer with wall blowing, modeled by with the shear stress transport formulation, to assess the impact of a turbulence model wall correction on the fuel regression. A discussion about the matching between numerical simulations and experimental data from hydrogen peroxide/high-density polyethylene hybrid rocket engine tests in an axial injection configuration for a pressure range of 1.1–3.6 MPa is reported to assess the improvement in the fuel regression and pressure reproduction provided by the turbulence wall correction.",35,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37578,"Recently, there has been a need for compact rapid-response power generators on aircraft. A novel solution to this problem comes in the form of coupling a rotating detonation engine (RDE) with a turbine generator. To improve power density, a new type of RDE, referred to as the radial RDE, has been developed. This design was based on a disk-shaped device within which reactants flow from the outer radius, detonate, and exit the inner radius. This was coupled into a compact centrifugal turbocharger turbine to extract the power. The first step in this process was to design a modular unit that would enable an understanding of the parameters that enable detonation in this type of device. Control over the throat area, channel area, and nozzle exit area enabled a range of area ratios to be evaluated. Other primary controls included the mass flow and equivalence ratio within the device. Initial results confirmed detonation operation between mass flow rates of at equivalence ratios ranging from 0.67 to 1.10. Operating frequencies and wave speeds are reported. Lastly, high-speed images of the exhaust as well as pressure traces are shown as confirmation of detonation, and reveal multiwave operation for various conditions.",35,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37553,"A plasma injector is designed to improve the flame stabilization of a typical coaxial injector. Based on the plasma injector experimental system, the effects of an ac dielectric barrier discharge generated plasma on a inverse diffusion flame are investigated. The electrical characteristics, discharge images, plasma species, thermal effect, gas dynamic effect, flame shape, and heat release are analyzed in detail. The results show that species including C, , , and CH are generated in the methane discharge plasma. The concentration of CH radically increases linearly with increasing voltage, while its spatial distribution tends to be uniform. However, the CH radical concentration decreases with an increasing flow rate. For application to plasma-assisted combustion, the thermal effect of the ac dielectric barrier discharge plasma on the C jet can be neglected. The heating is limited to within the injector. The jet angle, which reflects the transverse movement degree of the methane flow, is expanded by the discharge. Because of the gas dynamic effect of the plasma, which changes the pattern of the original jet, the mixing between the fuel and the oxidizer is improved when the discharge is active. The original unstable flame with a single layer is transformed into a stable double-layer flame, and the heat release from the flame is enhanced. However, the stable flame might become unstable if the discharge voltage is too high. The plasma shows better performance with respect to flame stabilization under a high flow rate or a fuel-rich condition. The lowest cost-effectiveness ratio is only 0.7% in the experiment.",35,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37371,"Laminar–turbulent transition plays a critical role in the aerodynamic performance of compressors and is sensitive to flow conditions and external disturbances. In the present work, a parallel large-eddy-simulation solver is developed and applied to investigate the effects of free-stream turbulence on the mode and location of transition on the blade suction surface of a compressor cascade under subsonic and transonic conditions. Both the parallel accuracy and efficiency of the solver are demonstrated. The transition location is observed to shift upstream as the free-stream turbulence level increases at both the subsonic and transonic conditions. Moreover, increasing the free-stream turbulence level from 0 to 4% causes the transition mode to change from Kelvin–Helmholtz instability-induced transition to bypass transition in the case of subsonic flow, whereas transition occurs in a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability-induced mode even at a high free-stream turbulence level of up to 7% in the case of transonic flow. The work demonstrates the ability of the parallel large-eddy-simulation method to capture the transitional-flow structures in compressor cascades and its potential application to the analysis and design of advanced compressor.",35,6
