On 1 May 2012, the HIFiRE Flight 2 project successfully flew a hydrocarbon-fueled, Mach 8 scramjet experiment and demonstrated the ability to fly an accelerating, constant dynamic pressure trajectory consistent with a scramjet-powered flight vehicle using unguided sounding rocket techniques. The project goals of capturing high-quality flight data from a research scramjet operating through dual-to-scram mode transition up to and beyond Mach 8 were achieved. HIFiRE Flight 2 is unique in its contribution to scramjet research, providing a reference dataset to the hydrocarbon scramjet community while maturing a novel and reduced-cost strategy for performing similar future experiments. This paper describes the programmatic approach, the overall scramjet flight test experiment mission objectives, and the flight test strategy. It also includes an overview of launch system and payload hardware, and brief discussions of flight activities, flight data, and experimental results. Preliminary results from flight indicate a fully successful mission and experiment. Based on evaluations of data collected during the project, including ground test, flight test, and multiple analysis activities, all project-level scientific objectives have been successfully achieved.",31,1

The elongated forebody that serves as the inlet of the engine is subject to harsh aerothermodynamic loading, which causes it to deform. Unpredicted deformations may produce unstart, combustor chocking, or structural failure due to increased loads. An uncertainty quantification framework is used to propagate the effects of aerothermoelastic deformations on the performance of the scramjet engine. A loosely coupled airframe-integrated scramjet engine is considered. The aerothermoelastic deformations calculated for an assumed trajectory and angle of attack are transferred to a scramjet engine analysis. Uncertainty associated with deformation prediction is propagated through the engine performance analysis. The effects of aerodynamic heating and aerothermoelastic deformations at the cowl of the inlet are the most significant. The cowl deformation is the main contributor to the sensitivity of the propulsion system performance to aerothermoelastic effects.",31,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35171,"Combustion mode transitions triggered through active fuel actuation and passive wall heating have been examined in a direct-connect dual-mode combustor experiment. Nonallowable flow configurations are identified through the comparison of the experimental results with an isolator impulse flow theory. These nonallowable configurations consist of three types: those that are facility loss limited, those that are associated with negative entropy generation, and those that fall outside the bounds of the normal shock compression limit. A second law of thermodynamics analysis of the isolator impulse theory and the experimental observations support these results, with the three sets of nonallowed flow configurations presented in terms of both the impulse theory and an experimentally determined operating point analysis of the device. The unstable transition from scramjet to ramjet operation was also noted during the wall heating triggered combustion mode transitions, for particular fueling and inlet flow conditions. A driving mechanism is proposed for this instability, which begins in scramjet operation and creates the rapid, and repeated, transition between combustion modes before stabilizing under ramjet operation.",31,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35269,"The analysis presented in Part I of this study is extended to investigate ignition transients and flame development in an ethylene-fueled scramjet engine. Unheated gaseous ethylene is transversely injected into the combustor upstream of a recessed cavity flameholder. Immediately after the ethylene–air mixture reaches its steady state in the combustor, a hotspot igniter is activated in the cavity to initiate chemical reactions. Cases both with and without air throttling downstream of the cavity during the engine startup stage are examined in detail. Successful ignition can only be achieved with the aid of air throttling under the present flow conditions. As a consequence of the backpressurization by the throttling air, a shock train is generated in the isolator, which then decelerates the high-speed main stream, enhances the fuel mixing efficiency, and increases the temperature and pressure in the combustor. Chemical reactions are intensified and produce sufficient heat release to maintain a flow environment conducive to flame stabilization. A self-sustaining mechanism is thus established between the flow and flame development. Stable flames are achieved even after the deactivation of air throttling. The predicted pressure distribution along the entire flowpath agrees well with experimental measurements.",31,1

Specifically, the focus of the study is on the effects of the imposed interaction and subsequent dynamics of a system of selected supersonic streamwise vortices on the reacting plume morphology and its evolution. The design phase of the experimental campaign was carried out with a reduced-order model, with the goal of identifying peculiar interactions among streamwise vortical structures introduced in the flow of interest. Two vortex interaction modes have been selected and later implemented using ramp-type vortex generators positioned symmetrically and asymmetrically on the pylon injectors, as prescribed by the results of the simulations reported here. Hydrogen/air combustion experiments, aimed at investigating the selected cases, were conducted in the expansion tube facility of the High-Temperature Gas Dynamics Laboratory at Stanford University. Stagnation enthalpy of , static temperature of 1400 K, and static pressure of 40 kPa were the chosen test conditions. Hydrogen at 300 K was delivered with two different total injection pressures. The supersonic combustion, ignition, and flameholding characteristics were documented with schlieren photography, chemiluminescence, and instantaneous OH radicals planar laser-induced fluorescence. The evolution of the reactive vortical system was probed in cross-sectional planes at a distance of 1.8, 4.3, 7.6, and 10.7 cm from the fuel exit plane. The results are thoroughly analyzed and the marked difference in the plume morphology between the two cases is explained. The similarities between the injectant’s predicted plumes and the measured distribution of OH radicals across the surveyed planes allow for an interpretation of the results based on supersonic vortex dynamics considerations.",31,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35205,"The physical process of mode transition, in which an accelerating hypersonic propulsion ramjet progresses from dual to scramjet mode operation, is explored in the context of the HIFiRE-2 ground and flight test campaign using three-dimensional, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations with a validated combustion model. Key highlights of the numerical procedure, mesh development, experimental validation, and the asymptotic end states are first summarized from prior work. From this basis, the methods and assumptions involved in the transient simulations are discussed with a focus on computational tractability. The results indicate that several major interactions play a crucial role in the mode transition, including separation associated with unsteady shock/turbulent boundary layer interactions, jet-in-crossflow barrel shock/flameholding, and cavity dynamics. The transition event, wherein the character of the flow changes in a rapid manner to delineate dual- and scramjet-mode phenomena, is generally similar in the flight and ground test simulations. As the freestream Mach number is increased under constant dynamic pressure and air-fuel ratio, shock interactions with the primary injectors result in loss of flameholding. The effects rapidly propagate downstream, altering the flow and combustion patterns in the cavity flameholder. Some noteworthy differences are present between the flight and ground test due to the shock system generated by the inlet of the flight article. These differences are highlighted to comment on the use of ground tests to predict flight performance. Details of the complex three-dimensional manner in which the combustion products and turbulence quantities vary during mode transition are also summarized.",31,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35187,"A numerical method is presented for measuring angle of attack and Mach number in the inlet of a supersonic combustor using a sensor design based on tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. A nonlinear least-squares fitting routine was applied to simultaneously retrieve the freestream Mach number and the angle of attack in a simple two-dimensional inlet and angle of attack with a known freestream Mach number in a conical inlet using simulated absorption spectrum. The spectrum spanned over five transitions in the -band of molecular oxygen. In the presence of 15% white Gaussian background noise, the fitting routine converged to the actual value of Mach number with a standard deviations of 0.5% for the two-dimensional inlet and to the actual angle of attack with a standard deviation of 3% for both the inlets. It was also found that, at the conditions used in the simulation for a conical inlet, a systematic error of 34 K would occur in freestream temperature if the usual two-line-ratio method were used and a systematic error of 0.25 would occur in freestream Mach number if the Doppler shift of the absorption peaks were used without considering the flow nonuniformity in the inlet.",31,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35299,"The performance of hypersonic inlets is significantly affected by the presence of shock/boundary-layer interactions. To examine the potential of microramps for shock/boundary-layer interaction control in a finite-width duct, a detailed experimental and computational study has been conducted with a separated oblique shock/boundary-layer interaction generated by a 12 deg shock generator at Mach 3.5. Results show that the shock/boundary-layer interaction in the finite-width duct generates complex three-dimensional flow structures with significant swirling nature, and the traditional microramps cannot suppress the separation effectively. Therefore, a type of highly swept microramps with a large chord ratio and small incidence angle is brought forward and investigated. By the precompression effect, the dividing effect, the obstructing effect, and the energizing effect, the highly swept microramps with a height of 0.24 times the boundary-layer thickness show good control capability on the shock/boundary-layer interaction. In addition, the efficiency of the control method for different shock impingement positions is obtained, indicating that the separation can be well controlled when the shock impinges on the aft part of the highly swept microramps.",31,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35298,"The fundamental flow physics of the interaction between an array of fuel jets and a hypersonic boundary layer is investigated. Hydrogen is injected at jet-to-freestream dynamic pressure ratios ranging from 0.350 to 0.875 on a flat plate into a Mach 4.5 crossflow. The injection array consists of four streamwise-aligned flush circular portholes. Both the streamwise spacing and jet-to-freestream dynamic pressure ratio are varied in a parametric study. The injection was performed completely within the boundary layer, with the intention of application to film-cooling drag reduction and boundary-layer combustion. Numerical simulations of four streamwise-aligned transverse sonic injectors in a fully turbulent hypersonic boundary layer revealed a very complex jet interaction flowfield. Variation of the streamwise injector port spacing, along with the jet-to-freestream dynamic pressure ratio, induced a variety of flow structures in the cases investigated. For all downstream interactions, the associated flow behavior was found to be a direct result of both the various upstream effects and interactions between adjacent injectors. Variations in the jet-to-freestream dynamic pressure ratio had a strong effect on the flow behavior. At low injection mass flow rates, coupling of adjacent injectors was small, whereas high mass flow rates increased the effect of jet-to-jet coupling. Variations in the streamwise jet-to-jet spacing were also found to play a critical role in the flow behavior. At very close spacings, intense interactions coupled the behavior of the individual jets; however, at increased spacings, the larger spatial freedom allowed individual jets to develop more naturally, leading to less jet-to-jet interactions. At the maximum spacing investigated, the jet interactions behaved more like discrete jets in crossflow.",31,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35423,"This paper presents the mixing enhancements of a spatially developing planar mixing layer interacting with an oblique shock wave by means of large-eddy simulation. The large-scale coherent vortices are found to be modulated by the oblique shock, which results in enhanced vorticity of the vortices. The thickness of the mixing layer impinged by oblique shock waves first decreases due to the increased compressibility effects of the shock wave, but then it increases and finally exceeds that of the shock-free mixing layer because of an accelerating growth rate larger than 0.05. The fluctuating levels of velocities and turbulent kinetic energy are strengthened in the shock–mixing-layer flows. The production term in the Reynolds stress transport equation dominates the increase of the transverse component of the Reynolds normal stresses, whereas the pressure–strain term decreases them and redistributes the energy to the streamwise component in shock–mixing layers, which then leads to the mixing enhancement between two streams. With the increase of shock wave strength, the thickness and mixing efficiency both increase in the shock–mixing layer. When the incident position of the shock wave moves upstream, the thickness of the shock–mixing layer increases much more and the mixing is realized faster. The present conclusions are helpful to further propose flow control strategy for mixing enhancement of supersonic flows.",31,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35339,"The performance of different boundary-layer bleed systems of a two-dimensional ramjet inlet has been investigated experimentally. The main objective of the study has been to identify the correlation between the inlet’s performance with different boundary-layer bleed geometries and the inlet’s internal flow. Experiments have therefore been carried out with varied boundary-layer bleed geometries at an angle of attack of 0 deg and at Mach numbers ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 in the Trisonic Wind Tunnel Cologne. The results are a continuation of an earlier study and show that the inlet’s performance and the effectiveness of boundary-layer bleed system depend on shock/boundary-layer interaction, unsteadiness of the flow, and flow separation.",31,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35275,"The focus of this paper is on the numerical simulation of compressible flow in diffusing S-ducts; this flow is characterized by secondary flow as well as regions of boundary-layer separation. The S-duct geometry produces streamline curvature and an adverse pressure gradient resulting in these flow characteristics. Two S-duct geometries are employed in this investigation: one was used in an experimental study conducted at NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field in the early 1990s, and the other is a benchmark configuration proposed by AIAA Propulsion Aerodynamics Workshop to assess the accuracy and best practices of computational fluid dynamics solvers. The computational fluid dynamics flow solver ANSYS-FLUENT is employed in the investigation of compressible turbulent flow through the S duct. A second-order accurate, steady, density-based solver is employed in a finite-volume framework. The three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are solved on a structured mesh with a number of turbulence models, namely, the Spalart–Allmaras, , shear stress transport, and transition shear stress transport models, and the results are compared with the available experimental data. The computed results capture the flowfield and pressure recovery with acceptable accuracy when compared to the experimental data. The turbulence model giving the best results is identified.",31,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35164,"This paper describes the numerical investigation of convergent conical nozzles done in the AIAA Propulsion Aerodynamic Workshop number one. Axisymmetric, three-dimensional, and unsteady computations were conducted for three main test cases. These test cases were 1) axisymmetric convergent conical nozzles of 15, 25, and 40 deg half-angle as well as a reference nozzle; 2) the 25 deg half-angle nozzle with a splitter plate inserted in its plane of symmetry; and 3) the vortex shedding observed at the base of the splitter plate. The effects of base drag and freestream Mach number on calculated velocity coefficient were analyzed. The discharge coefficients and velocity coefficients determined from the axisymmetric solutions matched the experimental data well. The wall Mach numbers and sonic line positions were also well predicted. In the axisymmetric computations, the shock position was well captured by the fine grid. However, when the nozzle pressure ratio was high, the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes results may have been less reliable. Three-dimensional results with the splitter plate in the nozzle show that the shock wave location is changed by the presence of the splitter plate. The unsteady zonal shear stress transport-detached eddy simulation method was used to simulate the vortex shedding at the base of the splitter plate. The primary shedding frequency of 32.2 KHz was obtained by analyzing the viscous force at the splitter trailing edge.",31,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35342,"Spike surface flowfields and base wake behaviors of clustered linear aerospike nozzles under the presence of external flow were characterized using surface pressure measurements, flow visualizations using the background-oriented schlieren method, and theoretical modeling. The test model consisted of three clustered cell nozzle modules or a nonclustered two-dimensional nozzle with an exit Mach number of 3.5, followed by a straight section and a contoured spike. The model was exposed to an external flow of Mach 2.0 to simulate off-design transonic flight conditions. The measured surface pressure distributions indicated that the entire flowfield on the spike surface became more two-dimensional under the presence of external flow. Periodic compressions and expansions of the cell nozzle jet were eliminated, but the pressure continued to increase downstream. The results of the flow visualizations found that this was mainly governed by the external flow that controls the jet expansion by forming a slip surface. This mechanism also made the spike base pressure higher than environmental pressure. The physics-based model predicted the measured surface pressure distribution well and explained the mechanism behind the influence of external flow. The effects of the external flow showed improvements in thrust performance in off-design flight conditions.",31,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35217,"This paper presents the results of a combined experimental, numerical, and analytical study of the occurrence of different vortex breakdown types and helical instabilities in realistic swirling combustor flows with axial air injection through a centerbody. A parametric study of the isothermal flowfield inside the combustion chamber and in the mixing tube upstream of the combustor is carried out in a water-tunnel test facility. Selected configurations were further assessed under reacting conditions. Next, a large-eddy simulation was conducted and successfully validated with the experimental data. The isothermal and reacting results show a strong effect of the inflow parameters on the type of the vortex breakdown and the frequency, amplitude, and shape of the global mode. Linear local hydrodynamic stability analyses, carried out on the time-average measured and simulated velocity data, yield the absolutely unstable domain inside the flowfield. Axial injection is shown to impede a zone of absolute instability near the combustor inlet, whereas a second zone further downstream remains. An excellent agreement of the measured to the calculated frequencies of the global modes is achieved over the whole range of investigated axial injection rates. The findings of this paper help to understand the mechanisms that are involved in the occurrence of global modes in swirling combustor flows and how they may be controlled by small flowfield modifications. Furthermore, axial air injection is shown to provide a suitable flowfield for flashback-proof combustor operation.",31,1

To take into account the effects of the pintle shape and movement, a sliding mesh method was applied. The physical nozzle throat based on pintle location was analytically investigated and found to compare well with numerical results. The static and dynamic results are verified with the experimental results. The flow separation shock trains as the pintle strokes are analyzed according to the three pintle models. The response lag and sensitivity of the chamber pressure and nozzle performance were evaluated for pintle reciprocation, insertion, and extraction processes to better understand the dynamic performance of the pintle nozzle. The pressure coupling effects of the propellant burning surface during the pintle reciprocation are conducted, which are compared with the cold-flow cases.",31,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35141,"In ultra-compact combustors, the length of the system is reduced by integrating the turbine turning vanes within the combustor and the primary zone is in a cavity recessed from the core flow. To understand the combustion characteristics of an ultra-compact combustor, the turning vanes were removed and a combined-diffuser flameholder was integrated upstream of a trapped-vortex combustor cavity. Two variants of the combined-diffuser flameholder are compared. In configuration , the row of passages nearest the trapped-vortex combustor is opened, whereas for configuration , an additional row of flow passages vertically adjacent is also open. Grid-independent three-dimensional simulations of these geometries are performed following a steady, multiphase, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, -progress variable/flamelet approach with source terms to model effusion cooling. Nondispersive infrared analyzers were used to measure the concentrations of , , and CO at the exit of the test section using three sets of emission rakes, with each having five vertically aligned, quick quenching sampling probes. Reasonable comparison was obtained between predictions and measurements of and mass fraction profiles. Besides comparison between the two configurations, the effect of combustion on the flowfield/flamelet/flame structure is provided. Recommendations on further improvement of the design and numerical model are also discussed.",31,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35180,"It is necessary to understand how film cooling both reduces the adiabatic wall temperature and influences the heat transfer coefficient in order to predict its benefit to a gas turbine hot gas path component. Although a great number of studies have considered steady film-cooling flows, unsteadiness has only recently been considered. Unsteadiness in the freestream flow or the coolant flow can cause fluctuations in both the adiabatic effectiveness and heat transfer coefficient, the dynamics of which have been difficult to measure. In previous studies, only time-averaged effects have been measured. The present study has determined time-resolved and waveforms using a novel inverse heat transfer methodology. Unsteady interactions between and were examined near a coolant hole on the leading-edge region of a circular cylinder simulating the leading edge of a turbine blade. The coolant plume is shown to shift back and forth as the jet’s momentum fluctuates, resulting in an increased spread of coolant coverage but less than ideal performance at any instant in time. The phase behavior of the and waveforms was also examined; in some locations, they fluctuate in phase, and in others, they fluctuate out of phase, again impacting the overall film-cooling coverage from the steady-state value. This is the first time that time-resolved waveforms for and have been determined experimentally.",31,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35279,"A semi-empirical one-dimensional model is developed for the incompressible lobed mixer–ejector design and optimization analysis. This model is deduced on the conservation relations of mass, momentum, and energy by using the control volume method with consideration of the incomplete mixing in a short mixing duct and the pressure loss of the intake system. To capture two key empirical parameters for charactering the operating point of the lobed mixer–ejector in this analytical model, the nonuniformity of the momentum profile at the mixing duct exit and the inlet loss coefficient of secondary flow, a series of three-dimensional numerical computations are carried out. By experimental validation, the semi-empirical model established in the present work is reliable for predicting the lobed mixer–ejector performance. The results show that there is an optimum area ratio of mixing duct corresponding to the peak entrainment for a given mixing duct length. As the mixing duct length increases, the mixing process between primary flow and secondary flow is improved toward complete mixing, raising the critical value of mixing ductarea ratio corresponding to the peak flow ratio. When the secondary flow area at the mixing duct inlet is small, the intake opening area of the entrained flow has relatively weak influence on the momentum profile nonuniformity. When the secondary flow area at the mixing duct inlet is large, the intake opening area of the entrained flow has adverse influence on the mixer–ejector performance.",31,1

A porous strut injector using transpiration cooling was demonstrated to be effective in a 60 s wind-tunnel test. The Mach number in the wind tunnel was 2.5 with a total temperature of 1774 K. Methane gas was used as the coolant of the transpiration cooling. The structural integrity was retained during the test, with only limited ablation at the top of the strut. Numerical predictions of the bottom surface temperature distribution agreed reasonably well with the measurements. The numerical results showed that the surface temperatures at the leading edge of the strut were dramatically reduced by the transpiration cooling.",31,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35172,"A linear stability analysis has been carried out to reveal the atomization mechanism of a power-law planar liquid sheet. The dispersion equation that governs the symmetric instability of a power-law liquid sheet is obtained by considering the gas boundary-layer thickness and the velocity profile of power-law liquid sheet. The dispersion equation is worked out by numerical solution to test the effects of the physical properties and flow parameters of liquid on the stability of a liquid sheet. Regarding the effects of rheological parameters, it is found that there is a critical value of consistency coefficient above which increasing will make the liquid sheet unstable, and below which the effect of is opposite. A larger flow index number makes the instability of the power-law liquid sheet damped. As the gas boundary-layer thickness, liquid sheet thickness, and surface tension increase, the disturbance wave growth rate will decrease and the instability will be damped. It is the gas-to-liquid relative velocity that governs the instability of the liquid sheet. A larger liquid density, viscosity, and density of ambient air can accelerate the growth of symmetric disturbance waves.",31,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35296,"An acoustically consistent, linear modal analysis-based analytical method is presented to predict the longitudinal and transverse combustion instabilities in a two-dimensional Cartesian dump combustor. At first, rigorous acoustical analysis (without combustion) is performed of two duct configurations with one and two discontinuities in the cross-sectional area. Novel, acoustically consistent jump or matching conditions are developed and applied at the duct cross-sectional interface(s), with distinct forms for the purely axial and nonaxial modes. The effects of uniform and nonuniform mean flows, cross-sectional area ratio, as well as of different types of boundary conditions on the duct acoustic modes are investigated. Acoustic modal frequency predictions are in excellent agreement with the analytical and numerical results of Meissner ( “ Effect of Cross-Sectional Area Discontinuities in Closed Hard-Walled Ducts on Frequency of Longitudinal Modes ,” Archives of Acoustics , Vol.  35 , No.  3 , 2010 , pp.  421 – 435 ). In the second part, combustion instabilities of a two-dimensional Cartesian dump combustor are investigated. The instability analysis employs the developed acoustically consistent jump conditions instead of the conventional mass, momentum, and energy balance-based conditions. Effects of the fluctuating heat-release source term in the acoustic wave equation are incorporated directly into the longitudinal wave number, obviating the need for a separate energy matching condition across the flame. A detailed investigation of the parametric space and boundary conditions affecting combustion instabilities is undertaken, and the consistency of the modal analysis with the Rayleigh criterion is explicitly demonstrated. Further, the present approach enables the consideration of arbitrary mean flame shapes in determining the unstable modes. Instabilities are demonstrated for the fundamental longitudinal mode and its harmonics, as well as for the fundamental transverse mode. The effects of the cross-sectional area ratio and flow Mach number on the unstable-mode growth rates are also presented.",31,1

Experimental investigations were performed on an actual multipoint spray injector geometry used in real aeronautical combustors. A test bench was specifically designed with continuously changeable acoustics conditions, which allows obtaining of a stable or an unstable flame for identical flow conditions. Different laser-based visualization techniques were used to analyze the kerosene spray (both liquid and vapor phases) and the heat released from the flame. A phase-averaged data processing of the planar laser-induced fluorescence images reveals the complex unsteady behavior of the liquid phase, its coupling with pressure fluctuations in the chamber, the heat released from the flame. The origins of the spray fluctuations are also analyzed.",31,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35400,"The avoidance of acoustic instabilities, which may cause catastrophic failure, is demanded for liquid-propellant rocket engines. This occurs when the energy released by combustion amplifies acoustic disturbances; it is therefore essential to avoid such positive feedback. Although the energy addition mechanism operates in the combustion chamber, the propellant injector system may also have considerable influence on the stability characteristics of the overall system, with pressure disturbances in the combustion chamber propagating back and forth in the propellant injector channels. The introduced time delay may affect stability, depending on the ratio of the wave propagation time through the injector to the period of the combustion chambers acoustic modes. This study focuses on transverse-wave liquid-propellant rocket engine instabilities using a two-dimensional polar coordinate solver (with averaging in the axial direction) coupled to one-dimensional solutions in each of the coaxial oxygen–methane injectors. A blockage in one (or more) of the injectors is analyzed as a stochastic event that may cause an instability. A properly designed temporary blockage of one or more injectors can also be used for control of an oscillation introduced by any physical event. The stochastic and design variables parameter space is explored with the polynomial chaos expansion method.",31,1
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35215,"With the increase in computational resources, time-accurate reacting flow, computational fluid dynamics have improved to the point where periodic, unsteady behavior associated with hydrodynamic instability and acoustic resonance can be accurately modeled. However, computational fluid dynamics solutions, like experiments, only reveal the manifestation of unstable behavior such as pressure fluctuations or vortex generation. They do not readily divulge the sources of energy transfer leading to and sustaining instabilities. Because of this, it can be arduous to correlate design decisions with overall system stability using computational fluid dynamics alone. Combining the well-established unsteady energy transport theory and a choice of viable data analysis techniques, a rigorous approach for analyzing time-accurate computational fluid dynamics solutions is established. Through this approach, the sources of driving and damping can be visualized and quantified. Thereby, the aforementioned issue is rectified and a deeper insight into the root causes of instability and its overall effect is achieved.",31,1

This work is intended as the prosecution of a previous study about hybrid rockets with diaphragms of different geometries inside the combustion chamber, where was injected in a gaseous phase. In this work, liquid injection is introduced, together with droplets vaporization and their coupling with the Eulerian gas phase, in terms of both heat and momentum exchange. The main objective is the description of the numerical models to be applied when liquid is injected. To validate computational fluid dynamics output, experimental results coming from a laboratory scale engine have been used. The different geometries studied include an engine with a cylindrical grain having no diaphragm and the same rocket with a four-hole diaphragm at 24% of the grain length. The simulations are steady state, and combustion derives from a single-phase chemical reaction. Liquid injection is fully simulated for the oxidizer, but paraffin entrainment is neglected for the fuel. Computational fluid dynamics results show a good agreement with the corresponding experiments, concerning the ballistic parameters of interest in this study: chamber pressure, efficiency, and characteristic velocity . Computational fluid dynamics predicts (both for gas and liquid injection) a higher efficiency for the rocket geometries provided with a diaphragm compared to the same geometries without a mixing device, and this is in accord with experiments.",31,1

Pressurized counterflow burner experiments conducted using pure oxygen revealed formation of surface char, which prevented measurement of solid fuel regression rates below 2 MPa, indicating an additional resistance for heat and mass transfer. Static-fired rocket motor experiments, conducted to determine the pressure and flow dependencies of the system, exhibited characteristic exhaust velocity efficiencies ranging from approximately 86 to 96%. Whereas classical hybrids do not have a strong dependence of fuel regression rate on pressure, a pressure dependence was observed in this system below the low-pressure self-deflagration limit due to the pressure dependence of the decomposition and fluorination kinetics of the solid fuel mixture. Below the low-pressure self-deflagration limit, the motor operated at a constant pressure, typical of a classical hybrid, whereas above the limit, a progressive burn was observed, characteristic of a composite propellant. Systematic oxidizer dilution with nitrogen revealed a decrease in pressurization rate with decreasing oxygen content, and an ignition limit was achieved for this system when the oxygen mass fraction was reduced from 0.65 to 0.6. Characteristic exhaust velocity efficiencies were not noticeably affected by oxidizer dilution with nitrogen over the range considered.",31,1
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35390,"The ignition and combustion properties of fuel-rich mixtures of boron and polytetrafluorethylene in air and argon were studied as a function of pressure at a heating rate of approximately to simulate heating rates that individual ingredients may be subjected to in propellant burning. Mixtures ranging from 20 to 100 wt% boron (balance polytetrafluorethylene) and pressures up to 7 MPa were considered in this study. Ignition of the samples was achieved by joule heating of a platinum filament within a pressure vessel of selected atmospheres. Ignition of the mixture was characterized by monitoring broadband light emission, whereas boron ignition specifically was verified by identification of the molecule using emission spectroscopy. At atmospheric pressure, none of the mixtures ignited within the duration of the experiment. Mixtures containing more than 80% boron did not consistently ignite under any conditions within the duration of the experiment. It was found that the ignition temperature for all of the mixtures was a function of pressure with a reduction in ignition temperature of about 300 K when increasing the pressure from 2 to 7 MPa. At pressures greater than approximately 3.5 MPa, the ignition temperature was insensitive to mixture composition for all mixtures that ignited. The results suggest that the enhancement of boron ignition is the result of sufficient polytetrafluoroethylene decomposition products to remove the oxide layer of boron.",31,1
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35324,"The incorporation of nanoaluminum in an 86% solid composite propellant formulation poses processing problems when following conventional methods. Therefore, to accommodate an optimum percentage of nanoaluminum in such formulations, a new bicurative system was introduced. Summarizing in the present study, a bicurative system consisting of toluene diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate was chosen to enable incorporation of 18% nanoaluminum powder (93 nm) in place of 18% micrometer-sized Aluminum powder. The developed compositions were studied in detail for their mechanical, thermal, sensitivity, and ballistic properties. The mechanical properties data, such as tensile strength, modulus, and percentage elongation, are almost on par with the values obtained with micrometer-sized aluminum powder using a developed bicurative system. The results of thermal properties reveal that, as the percentage of nanoaluminum increases in the composition, the onset decomposition temperature decreases. The impact and friction sensitivity data indicate that the sensitivity of the propellant formulation increases in comparison to micrometer-sized aluminum powder propellant. The ballistic properties, such as burning rate and ballistic evaluation motor data, reveal that there is more than a 110% increase in burning rate and a gain in specific impulse on the order of 6 s in comparison with propellants using micrometer-sized aluminum powder.",31,1
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35456,"The combustion behaviors of gel fuels containing micro- and nanosized aluminum particles were investigated in a pressurized chamber under typical ramjet conditions. Condensed combustion products were sampled in the jet plume behind the exit nozzles with two different rapid-insertion probes. The chemical composition of the samples was determined, and the structure of the sampled combustion products was studied with microscopic techniques. The formation of large aggregates of aluminum was observed, which left the combustion chamber with limited oxidation. The formation of such aggregates could explain why the substitution of micro-Al with nano-Al did not lead to the expected increase in combustion efficiency.",31,1
35,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35500,"A droplet stream combustion experiment was developed to understand the effect of reducing droplet size to a micrometer scale on the combustion characteristics of nanofluid fuels, which are liquid fuels with a stable suspension of nanoparticles. Pure ethanol and ethanol with aluminum nanoparticles at varying concentrations (up to 5 wt%) and droplet sizes were studied. The effect of particle addition on the droplet-burning rate was determined, and the mechanisms that are responsible for that effect were identified. The results show that the droplet-burning rate increases with increasing particle concentration. For example, with a 5 wt% addition of 80 nm aluminum nanoparticles, the burning rate increased by 140%. The burning rate enhancement is mainly attributed to strong radiation absorption of the nanoparticles suspended within the droplets, which provides more energy from the exothermic reaction (the flame) to the liquid phase (the droplets) for vaporization, thus increasing the burning rate. The radiation absorption effect becomes increasingly important as the droplet size increases.",31,1
36,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35345,"A numerical investigation of the head-on collision of two equal-sized alumina droplets has been conducted. Direct numerical simulations were performed by employing a volume of fluid method for tracking the interface and an adaptive mesh for improving the calculation efficiency. First, simulations of the head-on collision of tetradecane droplets in nitrogen were carried out, and three different outcomes of collision were captured: bouncing, coalescence after substantial deformation, and reflexive separation. These outcomes are in good agreement with the experiments. The numerical critical Weber numbers between the different regimes are also in good agreement with their experimental values. Next, the head-on collision of alumina droplets was investigated at various Weber numbers (1–800) and at one Ohnesorge number (0.1151). In addition to the three outcomes captured earlier, coalescence after a long extension between reflexive separation without satellite and reflexive separation with one satellite is observed. Furthermore, the numerical critical Weber numbers between these distinct regimes were obtained, and the numerical critical Weber number between coalescences after substantial deformation and reflexive separation agrees well with its theoretical value. Finally, collision models of alumina droplets are presented by modifying current droplet collision models.",31,1

In the microgravity environment, viscous and capillary forces can dominate body forces, and special considerations of these effects must be taken into account when designing a unique propellant management device for each mission and propellant combination. New high-performance green propellants are under development to improve performance and reduced mission costs, and to elicit efforts to further improve design of fuel-tailored propellant storage and feed systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of apparatuses intended to obtain high-quality imagery of liquids in exotic environments consistent with propellant tanks for rockets and spacecraft, as well as a review and comparison of several droplet photograph analyzing techniques used to determine surface tension and wall contact angle. This paper’s review of testing and analysis techniques, as well as its development of a testing apparatus that can sustain an adequately pressurized environment for cryogenic gases in addition to chemical compatibility for solvent-based propellants, can be used to design spacecraft or satellite propellant management devices that operate with newly emerging propellants.",31,1
38,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35247,"This paper presents an evaluation of the multiple-frequency phase-lagged approach, which enables the performance of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations on multistage turbomachinery configurations using a time-marching method. The major advantage of this approach is to reduce the computational domain to one single blade passage per row. The first part of the paper presents the method and discusses the associated assumptions and limitations. The method is then evaluated on the axial compressor configuration “Compresseur de Recherche pour l’Etude des effets Aérodynamiques et TEchnologiques” investigated experimentally at Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Acoustics. The computational fluid dynamics results are analyzed and compared both with experimental data and with a reference multipassage computation based on a sliding mesh approach. These comparisons enable the highlighting of the interests of this approach but also the underlining of its limits. The multiple-frequency phase-lagged approach enables the simulation of unsteady effects on a multistage turbomachinery and access to unsteady information that would not be available with a mixing-plane approach. However, if the method is capable of capturing unsteady effects linked to the adjacent upstream and downstream blade rows passing frequency, it fails modeling clocking effects, i.e., the relative influence between rows and .",31,1
39,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35039,"This paper revisits an old problem of validating computational fluid dynamics simulations with experiments in turbomachinery. The case considered here is NASA rotor 37. Prior computational fluid dynamics studies of this blade have been unable to predict a total pressure deficit at the hub as observed in the experiments. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is a small hub leakage flow emanating fore of the leading edge, between the forward stationary center body and the rotating disk. In this work, a large-scale high-fidelity uncertainty quantification study is carried out to investigate whether this indeed was the case. Computations are carried out on a 4.5-million-cell rotor 37 mesh with a small cavity fore of the leading edge. This cavity has an inlet with three boundary conditions: all assumed to be uncertain. A nonintrusive, orthogonal polynomial-based technique using sparse grids is used to propagate these three uncertainties, namely, leakage mass flow, leakage whirl velocity, and radial flow angle. A total of 158 sparse-grid-based design-of-experiment computations are carried out at two flow conditions. The results of the uncertainty quantification study show that a small amount of leakage flow can account for the hub pressure deficit at both on- and off-design conditions. For the uncertainty supports selected, the total pressure that best matched experiment was found to lie between the second and third standard deviations over the assumed uncertainties.",31,1

JBLADE uses an improved version of blade element momentum that embeds a new model for the three-dimensional flow equilibrium. In addition, a new method for the prediction of the airfoil drag coefficient at a 90 deg angle of attack for a better poststall modeling is also presented. The software is developed as an open-source tool for the simulation of propellers and has the capability to estimate the performance of a given propeller geometry in design and offdesign operating conditions. The software allows the introduction of the blade geometry as an arbitrary number of sections. To validate the code, the propellers from NACA Technical Report 530 by Gray ( “ Wind-Tunnel Tests of Two Hamilton Standard Propellers Embodying Clark Y and NACA 16-Series Blade Sections ,” 1941 ) and NACA Technical Report 594 by Theodorsen et al. ( “ Characteristics of Six Propellers Including the High-Speed Range ,” 1937 ) were simulated and the results were checked against the experimental data and against those of other available codes. Although current development work is focused in the design of airship propellers, the long-term goal of the JBLADE development is to provide a user-friendly, accurate, and validated open-source code that can be used to design and optimize propellers for distinct applications.",31,1
