0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37936,"The present research work introduces a novel combustion model formulation based on the flamelet concept suitable to investigate characteristic flow conditions in rocket engine thrust chambers. The new approach extends the validity domain of existing flamelet models to fully cover the observed flow conditions by incorporating kinetic rate effects into a state-of-the-art nonadiabatic flamelet manifold. This enables a transition between the fluid dynamic and reaction-rate-dominated combustion regimes, depending on the local Damköhler number of the numerical solution field. The approach is investigated based on a representative rocket engine test case focusing on highly nonadiabatic and de Laval nozzle flow conditions for the propellant combination methane-oxygen. Covering a range of propellant mixture ratios associated with significant variations of the underlying chemical effects, three flamelet combustion-modeling approaches of different manifold complexity are compared to high-fidelity laminar finite rate results based on the full chemical reaction mechanism. The obtained data show that the proposed model formulation is able to deliver a notably higher accuracy in the numerical prediction compared to the existing modeling approaches while retaining high computational efficiency to meet industrial design requirements.",37,4

In this Paper, we present a one-dimensional orifice model coupled to a global-averaged insert model, developed for lifetime prediction of a HC neutralizer in terms of orifice erosion; a modified sputtering yield curve is derived, similar to a previous literature work, and the role of anomalous resistivity is discussed in view of the erosion profile. Variations on the active length parameter, required for the insert modeling, are seen to affect the orifice plasma profiles and the erosion to a lesser degree, and the time evolution of the orifice channel confirms the expected asymptotic decrease of the erosion rate.",37,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38130,"A group of liquid simulants was developed in order to ease the process of cold-flow testing by lowering associated costs and hazards while providing accurate analysis of desired liquid behavior through an injector. Simulants were made with the intention of modeling certain physical properties of the liquid such as density, viscosity, and surface tension. These simulant solutions are capable of modeling liquid propellants throughout large physical property ranges by simply modifying the ingredient ratios. The effectiveness of these solutions in simulating their intended liquids was measured by performing various density, viscosity, and surface tension experiments along with cold-flow tests comparing the liquid breakup and pressure drops across the injector as a function of Reynolds number, Weber number, Ohnesorge number, and mass flow rate. The experimental tests proved that the simulants tested accurately demonstrated desired liquid density, viscosity, and surface tension values and were more effective at modeling jet breakup and pressure drop behavior of specific propellants than that of traditional cold-flow experiments using de-ionized liquid water, with little-to-no added maintenance or cleanup.",37,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37839,"Because of its excellent insulation capability, the usage of a silica-phenolic charring ablator as a nozzle liner is a common practice in the solid rocket motor industry. During the design of a solid rocket motor employing a silica-phenolic nozzle liner, it is desired to conduct an accurate analysis yielding in-depth thermal response and recession characteristics. As the interior ballistics and nozzle recession rate mutually interact, the best practice is to perform a coupled solution to both. Commonly used one-dimensional analysis tools with empirical approaches for estimation of convective heat transfer rate and blowing effect generally lack sought accuracy and do not model the transient shape-change phenomenon, which affects the nozzle performance. This Paper considers governing equations for charring, including pyrolysis gas injection and surface energy balance for melting ablation, along with a boundary condition governed by interior ballistics, and demonstrates a framework in which these equations are solved with governing equations for the nozzle flowfield in a coupled manner. Development and validation of a one-dimensional material response solver based on the same governing equations is also demonstrated. Also, results from a static firing test conducted with a small-scale ballistic evaluation motor employing a silica-phenolic nozzle insert are provided. Results from both investigations are compared and discussed.",37,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37935,"Conventional expressions and definitions describing performance of plasma thrusters, including the thrust, specific impulse, and the thruster efficiency, assume a steady-state plasma flow with a constant flow velocity. However, it is very common for these thrusters that the plasma exhibits unstable behavior resulting in time variations of the thrust and the exhaust velocity. For example, in Hall thrusters, the ionization instability leads to strong oscillations of the discharge current (so-called breathing oscillations), plasma density, ion energy, and as a result the ion flow. This paper revisits the formulation of the thrust and the thrust efficiency to account for time variations of the ion parameters, including the phase shift between the ion energy and the ion flow. For sinusoidal oscillations it was found that thrust can potentially change more than 20%. It is shown that, by modulating ion energy at specific amplitudes, thrust can be maximized in such regimes. Finally, an expression for the thruster efficiency of the modulating thruster is derived to show a mechanism for inefficiencies in such thrusters.",37,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38122,"The detrended fluctuation analysis, a technique for detecting long-range correlations in fractal time series, is used to characterize thermoacoustic oscillations of impending combustion instabilities. The slope of the linear regime of the structure function with respect to the time scale in a logarithmic plot, referred to as the Hurst exponent, takes a different value across a critical time scale corresponding to one pressure cycle. The slope for pressure oscillations over one pressure cycle, termed as the intercycle Hurst exponent, is a power-law scaling parameter for long-range oscillations; however, the slope for pressure oscillations within one pressure cycle, termed as the “intracycle Hurst exponent,” is no longer a power-law scaling parameter but resultant from the nonstationary, local average of highly nonlinear (as a function of time), seemingly sinusoidal, nearly periodic pressure oscillations. Both parametric studies and analyses of experimental data show that the intracycle Hurst exponent consistently increases with the signal-to-noise ratio and peaks at 1.6, thus having potentials for assessments of the safety margin to the onset of combustion instabilities. Given the same observation window, the measurement error (or uncertainty) of the intracycle Hurst exponent is significantly lower than that of the intercycle Hurst exponent.",37,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38214,"Computational fluid dynamics was used to study the flow through a scaled, mixed-compression, high-speed inlet with a rotating cowl at Mach 4.0 conditions. First, steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations were undertaken with a range of popular turbulence models including the Spalart–Allmaras model, the realizable model, the cubic model, and the Menter shear stress transport (SST) model to assess the impact on the inlet operating state. It was found that two models, the Spalart–Allmaras model and the Menter SST model, predicted the inlet to become unstarted at a cowl angle where the experimental data indicated the inlet remained started. Next, steady-state flow structures were studied at three discrete cowl positions, identifying highly three-dimensional flow features including regions of separated flow and spanwise gradients that became stronger as the cowl opened. Finally, the study culminated with the development of the new transient model, which allowed for time-accurate investigation into the unstart, restart, and hysteresis. The evolution of the separation bubbles was shown to be a major factor in the hysteresis, causing the inlet to restart at an angle different from where it unstarted. The utility of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations to capture the complex time-dependent details of such flows was demonstrated.",37,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38191,"A torsional thrust stand, calibrated for impulse bits in the range of , was used to measure impulse bits from a metal plasma thruster. Impulse data were obtained on roughly 1400 shots, with metal plasma thruster targets of molybdenum, niobium, palladium, aluminum, and carbon. Model predictions (based on a simple circuit model and published plasma parameters) were validated by data from the calibrated torsional thrust stand. Over a typical 50-shot firing sequence, the impulse bits measured showed a coefficient of variation of approximately 5%. This implies that individual impulse bits of about can be imparted to a satellite with variation about the mean in a total impulse burst of . For a 20 kg satellite, this would result in a velocity increment of just , enabling very precise attitude control and fine positioning control of nano- and microsatellites. The metal plasma thruster uses solid metal propellant and hence requires no liquids, gases, flow valves, or flow controls and has no moving parts. Total impulse approximately provides orbit raising and drag compensation capability.",37,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38093,"This study investigated the impact of fuel injection distribution on flame stabilization and heat release in a cavity-stabilized scramjet. Experiments were conducted using a hydrogen air heater that provided vitiated air at an average stagnation temperature of 1570 K and stagnation pressure of 12.7 atm, accelerated to a Mach number of 2.2 at the combustor entrance. Ethylene was injected using two fuel injection locations, one upstream of the cavity and another in the cavity. Three different fuel injection distributions were studied for global equivalence ratios of 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. Measurements included high-speed chemiluminescence and shadowgraph, as well as wall-mounted pressure transducers. It was found that when the cavity fuel flow rate was low, the flame stabilized on the cavity shear layer and resulted in a gradual pressure rise in the combustor. A sufficiently high fuel flow rate in the cavity led to flame stabilization upstream of the cavity, in the fuel jet wake, and a more confined combustion zone. Shadowgraph imaging showed that injection of the fuel from the cavity floor at a sufficient momentum penetrated the shear layer over the cavity and enabled flame propagation upstream of the cavity. It was concluded that the heat release distribution and pressure profile in the combustor could be significantly influenced by the fuel injection distribution through its impact on the flame stabilization mode.",37,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38147,"This study directly measures the performance of a thruster nozzle using water vapor as propellant in the Reynolds number below 1000. Because of its properties, water is suitable as a propellant for small satellites, often with a low-Reynolds-number flow using a micronozzle. The low Reynolds number of the flow and the phase changes in supersonic vapor flow should affect nozzle performance. It is essential to measure thrust performance and consider the flow dynamics inside the nozzle, but to date there have been few direct thrust measurements at low Reynolds numbers from 100 to 600 and different temperatures of the vapor from 290 to 400 K. In this study, nozzle performance is evaluated using two dimensionless numbers: the discharge coefficient and the specific impulse efficiency. The results presented here are specific to water vapor. The discharge coefficient remains almost the same under these conditions and higher than those of argon and nitrogen. The specific impulse efficiency depends on the degree of superheating above Reynolds numbers of about 250, but shows little dependence below Reynolds numbers of about 250 owing to the combined effects of viscosity and phase change.",37,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37980,"The Paper involves experimental and numerical heat transfer analyses of four pin-fin cooling configurations in a rectangular channel. Two design concepts were studied with two separate pin-fin (cylindrical and triangular) geometries. The first design includes a single-wall pin-fin configuration where the coolant flows through an array of full-length cylindrical (PF) and triangular pin fins (TF). The second configuration involves a double-wall pin-fin–jet configuration where the coolant jet impinges on the target wall, then flows through the array of partial-length cylindrical pin fins with jets (PFC) and partial-length triangular pin fins with jets (TFC). IR thermography was used to measure the steady state wall temperature of the target surface to estimate the overall cooling effectiveness . A transient heat transfer experiment was conducted to evaluate the internal heat transfer coefficient from the transient wall temperature. It is found that the double-wall pin-fin–jet (PFC and TFC) configurations show higher cooling effectiveness compared to the single-wall pin-fin (PF and TF) designs and the triangular pin fin (TF and TFC) showed a higher heat transfer augmentation compared to the cylindrical pin fin (PF and PFC) design. Numerical study later confirmed that the triangular pin fin creates a pair of streamwise vortices that augments the local heat transfer. The presence of the pin fin in the double-wall configuration prevents the development of a strong crossflow that negatively affects the heat transfer of the impinging jet. In addition, the triangular pin fin not only prevents the strong crossflow but redirects the coolant in the lateral direction that eventually contributes to the formation of a counterrotating vortex pair in the streamwise direction and thus augments local heat transfer and improves overall cooling effectiveness. Pressure drop measurement showed that the full-length triangular pin fin has a higher-pressure loss but the partial-length pin fin can lower the pressure loss considerably without compromising additional cooling performance.",37,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37909,"This paper describes the analysis of the flowfield in a four-stage low-speed axial compressor at the design point investigated both numerically and experimentally, with particular emphasis on the impact of stator hub flow leakage in a section of the machine featuring a change of stator configuration. The goal of the work is to give insight into the effect of the stator hub configuration on the aerodynamic performance in terms of loss and efficiency of downstream blade rows as well as the resulting stage matching effects. The investigation is focused on aerodynamic behavior and stage interaction, which the stator hub configuration of a given stage induces in a downstream stage with respect to its performance and flowfield. Two shrouded and one cantilevered stator hub configurations, such as those commonly employed in industry, are investigated and discussed with respect to local flow phenomena and stagewise aerodynamic effects. The results show that the stator hub configuration of a given stage has a drastically high impact on the downstream rotor aerodynamic performance, whereas the downstream stator as well as the upstream rotor are only slightly influenced by the stator hub configuration.",37,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38208,"In this study, a 1.35 kW HEP-100X Hall thruster is used to explore effective methods for improving the global efficiency of a Hall thruster across a wide range of flow rates, from the perspective of optimizing the channel configuration. Experimental and simulation results indicate that an appropriate increase in the length of the straight segment in the variable cross section channel can increase the neutral gas density as well as move the high-gas-density zone toward the channel outlet, thus increasing the ionization rate and moving the main ionization zone outward. At a low flow rate, the propellant utilization efficiency and anode efficiency can be improved by 2.4 and 6.1%, respectively. In addition, compared with a traditional Hall thruster of the same power with a uniform cross section channel, the HEP-100X Hall thruster equipped with the optimal channel exhibits significantly improved performance, and the lower limit of the anode efficiency is increased from 43.3 to 46.6% across a wide range of flow rates. This study resolves the issue of low efficiency of a Hall thruster at a low flow rate and also provides an effective solution for efficient discharge of the Hall thruster across a wide range of flow rates.",37,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38095,"An experimental investigation has been conducted on a subscale dual-bell nozzle to study the effect of throttle settings on sneak-transition side loads. The results are from a cold-gas test campaign conducted in a high-altitude simulation chamber for three throttle settings of 1, 2, and . An analysis is carried out by correlating the simultaneously acquired side-load measurements and real-time wall pressure data from transducers mounted in the vicinity of the wall inflection. The study reveals that the longer is the time duration of separation front in the region of wall inflection, the higher is the amplitude of overall sneak-transition side loads. Increasing the throttle settings from 1 to significantly reduces not only the overall sneak-transition duration but also the amplitude of flow unsteadiness in the region of wall inflection during the intermittent flow condition of the sneak transition and, hence, the associated side loads. It is further observed that even though the total transition time decreases with an increase in throttle settings, the actual transition side-load peak amplitude remains more or less similar irrespective of throttle setting.",37,4
