This is important because sand and dust often limit the useful life of engines operating in austere environments. To further improve the efficiency of inertial particle separator systems, an in-depth study of the multiphase flow dynamics has been undertaken. An experimental method was chosen to fill the void of available data and provide useful information for model validation. Using a facility at the University of Virginia, experiments have been conducted using three different inertial particle separator geometries. Surface flow visualization of each geometry is conducted using an oil-streak method to identify key flow structures. Separation efficiencies were calculated for an A4 coarse Arizona test dust (International Organization for Standardization 12103-1) over a range of operating conditions for each geometry.",31,4

The sensors employed a multilayer thermopile architecture fabricated via the additive direct-write thermal spray process, which enables their integration directly onto the components to be tested. The sensors were embedded within a 0.50-mm-thick (0.020-in.-thick) thermal barrier coating on test plugs that were inserted into the tunnel for testing. Fuel equivalence ratios and dynamic pressures were varied from to 1.0 and and 48 kPa (500 and 1000 psf), respectively, with increases in the global heat flux found to depend on the tunnel location. Heat flux values ranging from 30 to (26 to ) were measured downstream of the cavity flame holder, 20 to (18 to ) in the cavity flame holder, and 20 to (18 to ) upstream of the flame holder. Direct-write sensors reported heat flux trends that were consistent with separate area-averaged calorimetric measurements, and the local nature of the direct-write sensors enabled the detection of subtle transient phenomena not captured by calorimetry.",31,4

A partly covered cavity is installed in the scramjet combustor model to assist spark ignition of the liquid kerosene injection. The main factors affecting the ignition and flame expansion process, including the direct-injection pressure inside the partly covered cavity, the upstream-injection pressure, and the length of the baffle, were investigated with plenty of experiment results. The flame propagation process was analyzed via wall pressure distribution and thrust. The experiment results indicated that the pressure of the direct injection and the length of the baffle were key factors for the emergence of the weak combustion inside the partly covered cavity. The upstream injection could assist spark ignition inside the partly covered cavity and broaden the direct-injection pressure range that is suitable for ignition. Moreover, upstream injection can stimulate the propagation of the weak combustion to ignite the whole combustor. Fuel distribution near the shear layer of the partly covered cavity was indicated to be the key factor in this propagation process.",31,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35301,"The self-ignition characteristics of a solid fuel under supersonic flow have been investigated theoretically and numerically. Time-dependent two-dimensional axisymmetric compressible Navier–Stokes equations and species transport equations are solved numerically. Turbulence closure is achieved using the shear stress transport model. Polymethylmethacrylate fuel and a global one-step reaction mechanism are used in this study. The reaction rate is determined by finite-rate chemical kinetics with the turbulence–chemistry interaction modeled by an eddy-dissipation model. The numerical results generally agree with the experimental data in the published literature. The flame spread and pressurization during the self-ignition of polymethylmethacrylate in the combustor have been studied. The effect of inlet flow conditions and the geometry of the combustor on self-ignition behavior have been analyzed. Three stages of flame spread (namely, heat accumulation, secondary recirculation zone self-ignition, and orderly flame spreading) are identified during the self-ignition transient. Pressurization in the combustor during the third stage is evident. Self-ignition of the solid fuel can be affected by three kinds of limits: namely, lean oxygen, rich oxygen, and total temperature inlet conditions. A relatively long and deep cavity is beneficial to establish self-ignition. It is suggested that a step-type cavity can enhance self-ignition performance.",31,4

These temperatures approximate the range of surface temperatures reached during combustion when acrylonitrile–acrylonitrile–styrene is employed as a hybrid rocket propellant. This temperature range is significantly higher than temperatures evaluated during previous acrylonitrile–acrylonitrile–styrene fire-safety combustion and pyrolysis studies. Linear regression rates of acrylonitrile–acrylonitrile–styrene fuel grain material specimens are measured during pyrolysis and used to derive estimates for both the molar and mass-based enthalpies of gasification. Molar values for enthalpy of gasification are estimated from the regression rate data using an Arrhenius-type process model. The mass-based enthalpy of ablation is calculated from the power duty cycle of the heating element used to produce the fuel pyrolysis. Test results compare favorably with the previously published enthalpies of gasification, obtained at significantly lower surface temperatures, for extruded acrylonitrile–acrylonitrile–styrene. The additively manufactured acrylonitrile–acrylonitrile–styrene specimens exhibit a minor, but statistically significant, lower enthalpy of vaporization when compared to the extruded specimens.",31,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35449,"The simplest regression rate formula, which depends solely on oxidizer mass flux, originates from Marxman’s theory introduced in the 1960s. This commonly adopted model is still widely used, even though it cannot adequately represent the important effect of thermochemical properties associated to a given specific fuel. In this study, the space–time-averaged regression rate formula taking into account the mass transfer number is reevaluated to highlight its relative sensitivity with respect to the commonly used simple formula even if has been known to be a weak function on the regression rate. Polymers (High Density Polyethylene, Polymethylmethacrylate, and Polypropylene) are considered as fuel where theoretical mass flux exponent of 0.75 from the classical theory of Marxman is investigated when applied to the empirical regression rate. Besides, the effect of chamber pressure and use of motor oxidizer to fuel ratio on sensitivity have been quantified and experimentally analyzed. It is shown that Marxman’s theory is a very robust model and that its local regression rate theory extends well to the space–time-averaged experimental results for fuel lean cases. Finally, results of this study were consistent with the finding of Karabeyoglu et al., which showed that an oxidizer to fuel ratio correction is merely required for system operating under fuel lean condition.",31,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35571,"The cavitation performance of a three-bladed inducer is studied in this paper. The inducer with different tip clearances was tested at different flow rates. Two pressure transducers are installed at inducer inlet to measure unsteady pressure to differentiate several types of cavitation instabilities. Only the synchronous rotating cavitation is found before the cavitation performance curve breaks down at all low tip clearance conditions, and the synchronous rotating cavitation is strengthened and starting cavitation number increases with higher flow rate. Experiment results indicate that the synchronous rotating cavitation could be suppressed by high tip clearance and almost completely vanished with the largest flow rate.",31,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35097,"A multilevel design optimization framework was developed for the aerodynamic design of an electric aerial vehicle propeller in cruise conditions. The objective was to determine the optimum propeller shape to minimize torque at a given required thrust level and thus maximize overall propeller efficiency. A key concept of the design is the sequential application of a three-dimensional planform and two-dimensional section designs iteratively to make the best use of the complementary characteristics of gradient-free and gradient-based optimization strategies and the corresponding parameterization of the design space. Variable-fidelity aerodynamic analyses of blade element momentum theory and Navier–Stokes solutions were used to achieve computational efficiency and high accuracy. First, the optimal planform shape was determined by adjusting radius, twist angle, and chord lengths of the blade. Subsequently, the sectional airfoil design was performed at several spanwise locations. Given the new airfoil sections, the planform was redesigned to consider three-dimensional flow effects. The final optimized propeller design was validated using three-dimensional Navier–Stokes flow solvers and was tested in a wind-tunnel facility. Propeller efficiency was found to be improved by 5.7%. Finally, the fluid–structure interaction was analyzed to confirm that a required safety factor was ensured.",31,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35498,"Propeller performance is traditionally represented by a performance map that gives propeller efficiency as a function of the flight Mach number, the power coefficient , and the advance ratio . This work aims to demonstrate how this map changes when the design and change and to propose a novel map format that is able to capture the performance of different propeller designs. For this purpose, the propeller performance is simulated using a propeller lifting-line method validated for the SR3 propfan. Subsequently, the propeller model is used within a sequential quadratic programming framework to optimize the blade twist and chord distribution for different sets of design and . A complete propeller performance map is then generated for each one of the optimized designs. The results demonstrate that all the investigated propellers can be modeled by a common map, which determines separately the ideal efficiency and the viscous losses. The ideal efficiency is given in the traditional format of , whereas the viscous losses are represented as a function of the relative variables and .",31,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35399,"This paper presents the results of the rotordynamic analysis and design optimization performed for a turboprop engine-rotor system consisting of a free-power turbine and a gas generator. Predictions of static stresses, natural frequencies, and amplitudes are obtained by the in-house finite-element code. A detailed analysis of the finite-element method model (various beam formulations, three-dimensional axisymmetric model, point masses, and one-dimensional rigid disk elements) is provided. A sizing optimization problem of total shaft mass minimization is considered. Design variables are inner radii and wall thicknesses of shaft sections. Constraints are imposed on static stresses, natural frequencies, and amplitudes of the unbalance response. Changes in design variables are constrained to avoid contacts between the shafts of the twin-spool configuration. An in-house implementation of the sequential quadratic programming method is coupled with hybrid, analytical and numerical, sensitivity analysis. Results of the optimization show that a significant mass reduction in comparison with the baseline configuration can be achieved with all constraints being simultaneously satisfied. The optimal designs, however, must be finalized to meet other requirements not considered during the optimization. The Campbell diagram of the free-power turbine rotor system is significantly affected by the optimization.",31,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35388,"Because of the highest thermal load and the complex flow interactions, the cooling of the first vane leading edge is one of the most challenging problems in gas turbine aerothermal design. In industrial gas turbines with multiple can combustors around the annulus, depending on the clocking position between can combustors and downstream turbine, the first vane leading edges may also be exposed to large wake disturbances shed from the upstream combustor walls. The influence of these vortical structures on the first vane leading-edge film cooling is numerically analyzed in this paper, by using the flow solver TBLOCK. The initial flow domain with the cylindrical leading edge and cooling holes, based on an experimental setup, is extended to incorporate the effect of the combustor wall, which is modeled as a flat plate with a square trailing-edge. The location and the size of the plate are scaled to be representative of industrial practice. Two different axial positions of the vertical combustor wall model are investigated and compared with the datum clean configuration. A large-eddy-simulation turbulence modeling strategy with WALE subgrid scale model is applied to analyze the wake–leading-edge interaction, dominated by large-scale unsteady vortical structures. Numerical predictions show that the shed vortices from the combustor wall trailing-edge have a highly detrimental effect on the leading-edge film cooling by periodically removing the coolant flow from the leading-edge surface. This results in an increased unsteady thermal load.",31,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35511,"Nowadays the environmental and economic aspects emerge as essential alternatives in the design phase of microturbines. In design point definition for micro gas turbine cycles, not only engine performance requirements are necessary to have competitive microturbines but also external requirements, as cost and environmental issues must be in agreement simultaneously. To support engineers in defining the engine design point considering thermodynamic, economic, and environmental aspects, a gas turbine code was developed. The code uses a methodology that includes the sum of microturbine costs as power plant, fuel, and environmental emissions. The developed computer program was written in MATLAB® and is able to simulate the economic and thermodynamic performance of a given micro gas turbine cycle through an optimization process using genetic algorithm. The code is capable of calculating the suitable design point for a specific application. In this work, a 200 kW micro gas turbine recuperated cycle was chosen to study. As initial analysis, a parametric study was made to investigate the behavior of the main decision variables, considering costs and emissions. Afterward, single-objective and multiobjective optimizations were carried out using the objective function according to the proposed methodology. In sequence, a comparison was presented between the design point of a reference available microturbine and the same optimized by the code. The results reveal the importance of the cost optimization, showing how much savings can be achieved in choosing an appropriate design point for microturbines using the methodology implemented in the present work.",31,4

This paper provides a detailed study of the effects on the ignition transient of the main design parameters of solid-propellant motors. The analysis is made with the use of a quasi-one-dimensional unsteady model of solid rocket ignition transient, extensively validated, and used in the frame of the Vega program, for ignition transient predictions, reconstructions, and analyses. Two baseline solid rocket motor configurations are selected for the parametric analysis: a big booster with a three-segment propellant grain shape, similar to Ariane 5, and a small booster/solid stage with an aft-finocyl grain shape, similar to Vega solid rocket motors. The discussion of the results is particularly addressed on the possible onset of the pressure oscillations during the startup of the two solid rocket motor configurations, pointing out the design parameters that affect them in terms of occurrence and amplitude.",31,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35457,"This study addresses the response of a swirling annular jet flow and flame to transverse acoustic excitation in order to better describe key velocity-coupled processes during transverse combustion instabilities in lean, premixed flames. In particular, visualization and velocimetry techniques provide information about the effects of acoustic excitation on unsteady vortex development in the shear layers. Without acoustic forcing, the shear layers roll up into small vortices, driven by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, that convect downstream and grow. In the presence of high-amplitude acoustic forcing, as would be present during a combustion instability, the acoustic oscillations drive shear layer vortices to undergo a strong rollup event. Smoke visualization provides visual evidence of the rollup, while particle image velocimetry measurements show the development and trajectory of this large structure. Finally, planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH shows how the large coherent structure causes flame wrinkling at the base of the flame. The vortex rollup, responding at the frequency of acoustic forcing, creates large-scale wrinkles on the flame and can be the main driver of flame response during combustion instability.",31,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35529,"The verification of thermoacoustic stability is one of the most essential steps in the framework of the development of liquid rocket engines. In hybrid methods, which allow fast and detailed evaluation of the flame/acoustics interaction, the simulation of wave propagation is separated from the analysis of flame response to acoustic perturbations. This requires a feedback model for the interaction of combustion and acoustics. Transverse modes, which are particularly prone to combustion instabilities due to their low nozzle damping, are dominated by velocity fluctuations in the transverse direction. The interaction of these fluctuations with the combustion process in liquid rocket engines is numerically studied in the paper, employing a rocket engine configuration with hypergolic propellants as an example. It is shown that the fluctuations lead to major changes in the mean flow near the injector as evaporation and mixing are accelerated. Furthermore, the study reveals that the displacement of the flame center has a substantial thermoacoustic coupling potential. With forced single-flame computations, the strong slip between the flame motion and the acoustic velocity is analyzed. On the basis of the findings from the flame dynamics study, a feedback model to be used in stability analyses with hybrid methods is proposed, which allows one to take the flame dynamics originating from periodic flame displacement into account.",31,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35536,"The reliable numerical evaluation of thermoacoustic stability is one of the most important unresolved problems in the development of liquid rocket engines. To provide data for code validation, a transonic cold-flow test facility was built, which comprises a rocket engine model for acoustic measurements. It consists of a cylindrical chamber with inflow through a perforated plate representing the faceplate and a choked nozzle at the exit. The flow is excited with a siren and complex eigenfrequencies, and the nozzle admittances for the most critical first-transverse mode are extracted from dynamic pressure measurements. These data are used to benchmark three stability assessment tools of widely varying numerical complexity. Results obtained with one- and three-dimensional methods based on the solution of the linearized Euler equations and results from nonlinear Navier–Stokes computations (unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes) are compared with the experimental data. All three codes reproduce the measured first-transverse-mode frequency, but only the two linearized Euler equation methods provide satisfactory values for first-transverse-mode damping and nozzle admittance. The nozzle admittances calculated from the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes results exhibit large scatter, but the average of the data from 11 monitor points is close to the measured values and mode decomposition during data analysis is expected to reduce scatter further. However, the employed unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes method overpredicts nozzle damping.",31,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35660,"A mode-based, acoustic low-order network model for rocket chambers with resonator ring is introduced. This model involves effects of dissipation as well as scattering and mode coupling associated with a resonator ring. Discontinuities at the interface between acoustic elements are treated with integral mode-matching conditions. Eigenfrequencies and accordingly the linear system stability can be determined with the generalized Nyquist plot method based on the network model. Because of low computational cost, parameter studies can be performed in a reasonable time. An additional chamber eigenmode is observed for well-tuned resonators. Both the original and the additional mode show favorable stability properties for a generic test chamber. The optimal length and number of cavities are identified for that chamber. The need for analyzing the coupled system of resonators and combustion chamber in the design process is made evident by the discrepancy between detected values and those of an a priori consideration. Derived stability maps demonstrate that the region of stable operation is increased considerably by inserting well-tuned resonators. The destabilizing influence of temperature deviations in the cavities is quantified. Such sensitivities to modifications of design conditions can be extenuated by a ring configuration with several nonidentical resonator types. Moreover, the strong impact of the nonlinear correlation factor in the resonator modeling on the overall system stability is worked out.",31,4

The standard magnetic architecture, however, suffers from a lack of flexibility as its main purpose is to generate a well-defined topology that warrants a high and stable performance level. This contribution reports on a thruster with an unconventional magnetic circuit that allows covering a broad range of magnetic field topologies. Compared with a classical magnetic circuit, the proposed circuit is especially designed to control in an independent manner all the characteristic parameters of a magnetic topology. The new magnetic structure is mounted in a thruster prototype based on the PPS®1350-ML Hall thruster architecture. The prototype is named PPS-Flex. First, the design and construction of this original magnetic assembly are presented together with functioning of the control interface. Second, the flexibility is illustrated through several examples of achievable magnetic field configurations. Third, experimental results obtained during test campaigns of the PPS-Flex thruster fed with xenon as propellant gas are described and discussed.",31,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35558,"A cold-gas test campaign was conducted on a subscale dual-bell nozzle operating under sea-level conditions to study the unsteady flow conditions encountered during sneak transition, which is a phenomenon prevalent just before final transition occurs. The study reveals that the flow during sneak transition is highly unsteady and is the major source of side-load generation in the dual-bell nozzle preceding the final transition. Statistical analysis suggests that, as the separation front moves into the region of wall inflection, the separated shear layer gradually comes in close proximity to the nozzle extension wall that alters the flow development process in the recirculation/backflow region considerably. This sets the entire backflow region into pressure fluctuations, making the flow conditions highly unsteady. It is further observed that the flow during sneak transition is associated with low frequencies in the vicinity of the separation location (0.8 kHz), which decreases as the sneak transition nozzle pressure ratio is approached (0.2 kHz).",31,4

The ignition and combustion of monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) have been investigated in an unlike doublet impinging jet apparatus. Variation of the jet diameter and total propellant mass flow rate at constant oxidizer-to-fuel and jet momentum ratio allowed for investigation of critical ignition thresholds. Ignition probability was determined for each condition and classified as good ignition, a transition region, or failed ignition. Conditions resulting in reactive stream separation are compared with literature data obtained with hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide. Two critical MMH/RFNA ignition thresholds were identified: a residence time of 0.2–0.4 ms and a nondimensional sheet growth rate of . Two power law correlations were identified allowing for prediction of an MMH/RFNA sheet growth rate given a residence time or Reynolds number. Thermal ignition theory was adapted to simulate the experiment, and selection of model parameters resulted in a trend that supports the experimental data and provides insight into the condensed-phase reaction rates. The results from this work are intended to provide an experimental data set for validation of MMH/RFNA combustion models and to guide the selection of injection conditions for impinging jet systems.",31,4

To properly understand propellant tank functionality, reliable data on the solubilities of pressurant gases in these propellants are needed. Thus, the solubility of helium in liquid hydrazine has been measured as a function of pressure and temperature. The current measurements were conducted at pressures relevant to in-space applications of 0 to 1000 psia for the first time. The temperature dependence was studied in the relevant temperature range of 278 to 308 K. The current results do not agree with the only previous measurement of helium solubility in hydrazine. These previous measurements were conducted in a much lower-pressure regime. The cause of the discrepancies between the current measurements and the previous measurements is unclear.
