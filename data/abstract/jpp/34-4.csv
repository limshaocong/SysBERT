0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36665,"This study investigates stoichiometric premixed flames. Our recent studies show that these oxy flames behave differently under turbulent versus laminar conditions, with the extinction strain rate being the key parameter for comparing flame stability. This work builds on that conclusion by investigating why there are differences in extinction strain rates and flame consumption speeds, and the effect of reactant inlet temperature on air and oxy flames. The Lewis number for oxy flames is less than one, whereas the methane-air flame is close to unity. This impacts the response of these two flames to strain. The dominant mechanism is the chemical effect of present in oxy combustion, which has a bigger impact on the consumption speed and flame extinction strain rate than the effect of transport properties change and Lewis number differences. Specifically, the extinction strain rate was found to be heavily impacted by the reaction .",34,4

Simulating results and sensitivity analysis show that Davis Mech, NUIG Mech, and Varga Mech have more accurate computational results than GRI 3.0, SD Mech, and Li Mech at around 1000 K because for reaction the former three mechanisms have a lower reaction rate. Oxidation of occurs mainly through reactions and , whereas is the dominant reaction for the oxidation of CO. Comparative analyses of syngas with the same ratio at 94% and 79% Ar dilution rates show that heat absorption of Ar during combustion is the main cause of long ignition-delay time, although Ar also inhibits the reactivity of syngas through at 1000 K. Moreover, the pressure response curve rises slowly with 94% Ar dilution but sharply with 79% Ar dilution under low-temperature conditions, and detonation (or deflagration to detonation) can be observed under such conditions. In addition, emission was observed behind the incident shock wave when its velocity reached with 79% Ar dilution, and it was unable to measure ignition-delay time behind the reflected shock wave.",34,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36652,"Results are presented on the freejet testing of a 75%-scale replica of the HIFiRE 7 scramjet. The HIFiRE 7 scramjet flowpath includes a two-dimensional forebody, a rectangular-to-elliptical shape transition inlet, an elliptical combustor, and a thrust nozzle. Only porthole injectors are used, giving the internal flowpath a clean configuration suitable for high-Mach-number operation with no physical obstructions to the flow. Furthermore, the structure of the shock waves in the scramjet is tailored to introduce a shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction in the combustor to promote fuel ignition. The objective of the experiments is to investigate the performance of this scramjet flowpath at a simulated flight Mach number of 7.5 and an altitude of 29.5 km with gaseous hydrogen as the fuel. Static pressure measurements show that robust combustion can be sustained in the flowpath at a range of equivalence ratios between 0.48 and 0.84. Based on these experiments, a fuel equivalence ratio of 0.8 is recommended for the flight. Corresponding surface heat transfer measurements reveal that, when the fuel–air mixtures ignite and burn, the surface heat transfer levels in the combustor and nozzle increase to as much as three times the fuel-off levels. A quasi-one-dimensional cycle analysis of the tests shows that the overall fuel-based combustion efficiency of this engine is 89% at the fuelling conditions planned for the flight.",34,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36501,"A method to efficiently predict the time-mean large-eddy simulation solutions of different designs is developed and applied to the various trailing-edge cutback cooling designs in a design space. The designs are generated using the taper angle and blowing ratio as two design variables. First, a few sample designs are evaluated by the large-eddy simulation. On each sample design, the source terms for the steady-state governing equations are derived from the time-mean large-eddy simulation solution. With the source terms, the steady-state solution is shown to be able to reproduce perfectly the time-mean large-eddy simulation solution for each sample design itself. Next, a method is developed to propagate the source terms from the sample designs to the other designs. With the propagated source terms, the steady-state solutions for all the different test designs are shown to agree well with their direct large-eddy simulation solutions. The present results illustrate the feasibility to efficiently predict the time-mean large-eddy simulation solutions using fast steady-state simulations for the different trailing-edge cooling designs in a design space with good accuracy, without requiring large-eddy simulations for all the designs. The potential to obtain large-eddy-simulation-based design evaluations efficiently and accurately for performance optimization of complex realistic configurations is thus demonstrated.",34,4

The focus is placed on turbulence quantities and their influence on the computed mean fields. However, the subject of this paper is not a pure study of turbulence model variation, but it aims at showing its effect within the framework of different overall setups. These comprise differences in combustion models as well as codes used. Several Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approaches incorporating the Boussinesq approximation for the modeling of Reynolds stresses are considered. Turbulent heat and mass transfer are modeled via turbulent Prandtl and Schmidt numbers. Characteristic tendencies of the turbulence models are observed across the different codes and combustion models. Furthermore, the relevance of turbulence modeling parameters depends on the combustion modeling approach. An influence of the code used is found as well.",34,4

Gas-turbine engines (turbofans and turboprops), two- and four-stroke reciprocating (diesel and spark-ignition) engines, and electric motors (with electric generation by a combustion engine) are analyzed. Thermal analyses of these engines are performed in the power range of interest. Consideration is given to two types of generic missions: 1) a mission dominated by a constant-power requirement, and 2) a mission with intermittent demand for high thrust and/or substantial auxiliary power. The weights of the propulsion system, required fuel, and total aircraft are considered. Nowadays, diesel engines for airplane applications are rarely a choice. However, this technology is shown to be a very serious competitor for long-duration unmanned air vehicle flights. The two strongest competitors are gas-turbine engines and turbocharged four-stroke diesel engines, each type driving propellers. It is shown that hybrid-electric schemes and configurations with several propellers driven by one power source are less efficient. At the 500 KW level, one gas-turbine engine driving a larger propeller is more efficient for durations up to 25 h, whereas several diesel engines driving several propellers become more efficient at longer durations. The decreasing efficiency of the gas-turbine engine with decreasing size and increasing compression ratio is a key factor.",34,4

The life of the lanthanum-hexaboride insert in these hollow cathodes is projected to range from 10 kh to over 100 kh based on insert evaporation calculations. A detailed investigation of the life of a 1.5 cm outside-diameter lanthanum-hexaboride hollow cathode has been made. This cathode can provide discharge currents between 5 and 100 A and has an estimated lifetime in excess of 50 kh depending on discharge current and mass flow rate. The insert evaporation rate is determined from a 4000 h discharge wear test of a laboratory model cathode, where insert weight-loss measurements were made at the start, middle, and end of the test. Detailed insert temperature and plasma measurements are used in a one-dimensional disk evaporation model that accommodates the insert temperature profiles found with different discharge currents, flow rates, and cathode orifice diameters, to predict the insert life. The results suggest that insert outgassing is significant early in life, and lanthanum redeposition reduces the net evaporation rate and extends the cathode life.",34,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36312,"Embedded stress sensors have previously been employed as part of health monitoring systems for solid rocket motors; however, the sensor readings were used to detect anomalies such as bore cracks and bondline delaminations. This work is unique because, instead of structural defects, the sensors are used to determine changes to both the modulus and the stress-free temperature: both of which are useful and difficult to obtain. To do this, sensors were embedded into a test motor (a small motor with a metal case, insulation, and an inert composite propellant formulation) and subjected to stepwise cooling cycles: the sensor readings at each plateau in the cooling cycle were a function of the stress-free temperature and modulus. When analyzed, the data gave both the modulus and stress-free temperature shift in the motor. The sensor and accompanying analyses were used to establish baseline readings; then, the motor was aged, and the procedures were repeated. Over an equivalent age of several years (about 4.5 years of aging at ambient temperature), the modulus changed by about 20%. Shifts in stress-free temperature were harder to detect and will be investigated in future work.",34,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36530,"Nanosecond-pulsed surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators are used to control shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions. Characterization of the separation region without plasma actuation is conducted to understand the interaction based on measurements of pressure distribution, schlieren imaging, and velocimetry by the femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging technique. The results show a weak separation due to the interaction. Three types of plasma actuators are applied to control the separation. Schlieren images are taken by a high-speed camera to evaluate the magnitude of the interaction. It is shown that the plasma actuators affect the flow in two different ways: heat generation in the boundary layer, and generation of vorticity near the surface. When the first effect is dominant, the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction becomes stronger and the size of the separation bubble increases. If the vorticity generation prevails, it suppresses the separation due to the momentum transfer from the main flow to the boundary layer. The experimental results of the three actuator’s geometries provide the design guidelines for nanosecond-pulse-driven electrodes to control the interaction. An optimal actuation frequency is found through an investigation of the frequency response of the flow.",34,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36676,"An intercooling technique using convective cooling channels in the compressor stator vanes has been proposed recently. In this paper, two cooling methods are presented, and numerical simulation is conducted using the conjugate heat transfer method to study the effect of cooling on the laminar boundary layer and turbulent boundary layer in compressors. A flat plate and a two-dimensional compressor vane are numerically simulated to study the effect of cooling on the two-dimensional boundary layer on the flat plate and curved surface, respectively. It is found that cooling decreases the size of the laminar separation bubble and delays turbulent separation; this reduces the drag coefficient at both design and off-design angle of attack. Further, a three-dimensional compressor vane with cooling channels and cooling endwalls is also numerically simulated. It is found that the cooling channels decrease the total pressure loss at the corner separation region; this proves that the proposed cooling method can be applied as a flow control method in the compressor.",34,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36748,"An experimental study was conducted to investigate the dynamic ice accretion process over the blade surfaces of a rotating propeller model for unmanned-aerial-system (UAS) applications. In addition to revealing the transient ice accretion process over the rotating propeller surfaces, the dynamic thrust force generated by the propeller model was also measured simultaneously along with the required power inputs to drive the propeller model. Because of the combined effects of aerodynamics forces and the centrifugal force associated with the rotation motion, the ice accretion process over the rotating propeller surfaces was found to become very complicated. The ice accretion over the rotating propeller surfaces was found to become more preferable along the radial direction with the formation of lobster-tail-like ice structures extruding out from the propeller blade surfaces. The aerodynamic performance of the propeller model was also found to degrade tremendously due to the ice accretion, causing a significant reduction (i.e., up to 70% reduction) in mean thrust generation and a dramatic increase in force fluctuation amplitude (i.e., up to 250% increase). Despite of different types of ice accretion, the propeller model was always found to consume more power operating under icing conditions (i.e., up to 250% more power consumption under glaze icing conditions).",34,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36408,"The instantaneous spray images of a pressure swirl injector with a trumpet have been captured by a Photron Fastcam SA-Z camera. A characteristic wave structure tracing method based on mutual information has been proposed to measure the wave velocity, and the relation between wave velocity and film velocity has been investigated theoretically. A semi-empirical flow characteristics prediction model has been proposed, and the flow characteristics in the trumpet have been calculated. The results show that the film velocity equals the varicose wave velocity and is slightly larger than the sinuous wave velocity. Therefore, the wave velocity obtained from experiment can be used as film velocity in the range of allowable error. The proposed characteristic wave structure tracing method overcomes the defect of the direct measurement method. The measured axial wave velocity increases linearly with the increase of the liquid mass flow rate. The predicted spray cone angle agrees well with the experiments when the trumpet is considered, and it increases with the increase of liquid mass flow rate. In the trumpet section, the film thickness and tangential velocity significantly decrease, whereas the axial velocity increases. That is why the film thickness at the injector exit and spray cone angle decrease with the increase of the trumpet angle.",34,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36459,"This report presents ground tests and flight operation results for a miniature ion propulsion system for microsatellites to show the feasibility of ion thruster applications in small satellites. The propulsion system incorporated a 10-W-class microwave discharge ion thruster and consumer-product-based subcomponents. The low-power ion thruster realized a total power consumption of less than 30 W, which was compatible with 50-kg-class small satellites. A key part of the subcomponents was a xenon feed system including a high-pressure tank that complied with the High Pressure Gas Safety Act, had high safety, and had good handling ability. The total mass and volume of the flight model were 8.10 kg and with 0.89 kg of xenon propellant. The thruster performance determined by the ground tests was a thrust of , a specific impulse of 786–699 s at a mass flow rate of , and total power consumption of 28.1–29.8 W. The miniature ion propulsion system was installed on a Hodoyoshi-4 microsatellite (66 kg mass), which was launched to low Earth orbit.

13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36776,"This study makes an attempt to demonstrate a technique to embed the catalyst on ammonium perchlorate surface. In the present study, various techniques like differential scanning calorimeter, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscope, and x-ray computed tomography scan analysis as well as others were used to establish the effectiveness of this technique. Micron-sized iron oxide was used in this study for embedding the catalyst on ammonium perchlorate. Burn rates of pellets containing different fractions of iron oxide from various sources were measured to establish an optimum fraction for highest burn rate of ammonium perchlorate pellets achievable with iron oxide. These burn rates were measured using a Crawford bomb, and a fraction of 1% iron oxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was highest among them for pellets. The burn rate of the ammonium perchlorate pellet with 1% iron oxide at 70 bar pressure recorded was . This fraction of iron oxide was also used to study the effect of embedding the catalyst on ammonium perchlorate surface when used in nonaluminized composite solid propellants. It is observed that catalyst-embedded ammonium perchlorate yields a higher burn rate as compared to the mechanically mixed catalyst.",34,4

A reformulated partially stirred reactor (PaSR) is proposed to adapt it for high mesh resolution. A skeletal mechanism consisting of only 28 species and 92 reactions is reduced for the kerosene combustion modeling. A one-dimensional solid-gas-liquid coupling method is developed to simulate the active cooling effect. The time-averaged static pressure and wall heat flux profiles are well predicted for both fuel-lean and stoichiometric cases. The supersonic flow, mixing, and combustion characteristics under the two fuel/air ratios are quantitatively compared based on the efficiency indices, Takeno Flame Index, and the correlation statistics between heat release rate and mixture fraction. The vorticity and its evolution are analyzed through the five source terms for the two cases. The turbulence-chemistry interaction is then analyzed by the aid of numerous quantitative indices, such as Damköhler number, PaSR coefficient, and scalar dissipation rate, as well as their correlation statistics to identify the main combustion modes in the scramjet combustor.",34,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36947,"Two-dimensional numerical simulations of a nonequilibrium disk-shaped magnetohydrodynamic generator with swirl vanes were conducted to clarify the influences of electrical conductivity of swirl vanes and wakes induced by the swirl vanes on plasma flow and generator performance. The working gas was assumed to be helium seeded with cesium vapor. The thermal input to the magnetohydrodynamic generator and the strength of the applied magnetic field were set to 11 MW and 3 T, respectively. The swirl vanes were assumed to be made of either electrically conductive or insulated material. Low magnetic Reynolds number magnetohydrodynamic equations coupled with a conventional two-temperature plasma model were used for the simulations. The numerical results showed that the electron temperature and electrical conductivity of the plasma in the region between vanes for the conductive vanes were higher than those for the insulated ones. The differences between the two cases, however, rapidly disappeared right after the plasma passed through the region between vanes. Consequently, the swirl vane’s electrical conductivity hardly influenced the generator performance. The numerical results also demonstrated for the first time that the inside and the vicinity of the wakes had either low-power-output densities or negative ones corresponding to power consumption.",34,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36859,"Aluminized ammonium perchlorate composite propellants can form large molten agglomerated particles that may result in poor combustion performance, slag accumulation, and increased two-phase flow losses. Quantifying agglomerate size distributions are needed to gain an understanding of agglomeration dynamics and ultimately design new propellants for improved performance. Due to complexities of the reacting multiphase environment, agglomerate size diagnostics are difficult and measurement accuracies are poorly understood. To address this, the current work compares three agglomerate sizing techniques applied to two propellant formulations. Particle collection on a quench plate and backlit videography are two relatively common techniques, whereas digital inline holography is an emerging alternative for three-dimensional measurements. Atmospheric pressure combustion results show that all three techniques are able to capture the qualitative trends; however, significant differences exist in the quantitative size distributions and mean diameters. For digital inline holography, methods are proposed that combine temporally resolved high-speed recording with lower-speed but higher spatial resolution measurements to correct for size–velocity correlation biases while extending the measurable size dynamic range. The results from this work provide new guidance for improved agglomerate size measurements along with statistically resolved datasets for validation of agglomerate models.",34,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36700,"The efficiency of a preswirled cooling air delivery system depends critically on the performance of the preswirl nozzle. To achieve the expected temperature drop, accurate prediction of the nozzle discharge behavior is quite essential. In the current study, the discharge coefficients of a cascade vane nozzle and a vane-shaped hole nozzle are tested in a simplified plate setup without a rotor. The influences of the pressure ratio and Reynolds number on the discharge behavior are investigated experimentally. The overall pressure ratio across the preswirl rig is varied from 1.1 to 1.9, and the Reynolds number is in the range of to . Numerical simulations are also performed to compare the flow characteristics and temperature drop between these two nozzles. Results indicate that the experimental and numerical data show good agreement for different conditions. Increasing the pressure ratio causes the deviation angle and discharge coefficient to increase. The discharge coefficient and preswirl effectiveness both increase first and then remain constant with the Reynolds number. In addition, the cascade vane nozzle and vane-shaped hole nozzle have similar discharge coefficients: both around 0.95. However, the vane-shaped hole nozzle benefits from its smaller deviation angle, resulting in a higher preswirl effectiveness and higher swirl ratio at the nozzle exit. Consequently, the vane-shaped hole nozzle gives an 8.7% improvement in temperature drop as compared with the cascade vane nozzle.",34,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36782,"A mathematical model of the ion–acoustic turbulence that is known to develop in the plume of hollow cathodes is presented. The model takes the form of a partial differential equation for the ion–acoustic wave energy density that can be solved concurrently with a set of the equations of motion that have been augmented with anomalous terms to account for the ion–acoustic turbulence-driven transport of momentum and heat for electrons and ions. Numerical simulations in two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that solve the complete system of these equations show significantly better agreement with plasma measurements compared to a previous idealized model, which assumed complete saturation of the ion–acoustic turbulence and did not account for the growth stage of the waves. In particular, the model is able to predict accurately the location and magnitude of the maximum resistivity to the electron current along the cathode centerline.",34,4
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36895,"This contribution presents the experimental setup and the results of stationary cylinder wall temperature and unsteady gas temperature measurements in the appendix gap of an experimental machine, which can be switched between different regenerative cycles. Direct measurements in the gap are important for the validation and verification of existing analytical modeling approaches for appendix gap losses because these losses may reduce the power of Stirling engines significantly; so far, no direct measurements have been conducted to prove the modeling assumptions. The gas temperatures are measured by newly developed fine-wire thermocouple probes, the design of which is explained in detail. The results show curved axial wall temperature profiles and roughly sinusoidal gas temperature fluctuations, which are dependent on the radial and axial positions. In the axial center of the gap, the assumption of laminar flow conditions is largely fulfilled; whereas at the open end of the gap, intermittent disturbances are observed, presumably due to turbulent eddies entering the gap from the cylinder volume during the inflow period. A comparison to analytically calculated temperatures shows a qualitatively good agreement in the main section of the appendix gap.",34,4

An ignition system using the discharge plasma of noble gas, called a discharge plasma system, has been proposed in substitution for the conventional solid catalysts. However, the combustion characteristics of the thruster are not well understood. The present study conducted firing tests of a 1-N-class thruster with the discharge plasma system under a vacuum condition. The objectives of the study were to experimentally evaluate the effects on the combustion characteristics of the combustion chamber characteristic length and the propellant injection method by the measurement of thrust and pressure. In this paper, the combustion characteristics of the monopropellant are discussed by considering the characteristic exhaust velocity efficiency and power consumption. In addition, the thruster lifetime is evaluated in terms of electrode degradation. With the non-atomized injector, a maximum thrust of 0.34 N is achieved at an argon mass flow rate of , a hydroxylammonium-nitrate-based monopropellant mass flow rate of , and a combustion chamber characteristic length of 508 mm. In addition, it was observed that a shorter combustion chamber characteristic length increased the characteristic exhaust efficiency. At an accumulated firing time of 1646 s, no effect of electrode degradation on the performance of the thruster was observed.",34,4

This measurement is performed in real time near the coil within the resonant circuit using a patented low-noise radio-frequency voltage and current sensor system. With knowledge of the actual forwarded power, the efficiency of the generator under consideration, including the power feed cable, is assessed in real time. The variation of the power-to-thrust ratio can thus be understood more clearly since its value is given by physical changes of the plasma properties as well as the quality of the impedance bridge between the generator and plasma load. The latter can directly be determined by the proposed methodology, while the influence of the plasma parameters on the power-to-thrust ratio is obtained by means of a numerical model that is used in postprocessing to assess the power distribution within the thruster.",34,4

To provide a short ignition delay, an ignition support material consisting of and a composite propellant were coated on the fuel grain. For the test, an oxidant gas having a controlled temperature and pressure and an oxygen composition close to that of the air in a ramjet combustor was supplied using an ethanol-blended hydrogen peroxide gas generator. Air simulant gas was supplied with an average mass flow rate near and a Mach number of 0.21 in the fuel grain port. Through the test, the noticeable effect of B particles on combustion was confirmed by a high regression rate over and combustion efficiency over 80%.

Consequently, discrete stationary measurements can be skewed and contribute to uncertainty in calculated one-dimensional performance. Thus, this research characterizes vane wake variability in a three-stage axial compressor and explores the implications on efficiency calculations. Detailed circumferential traverses with seven-element total pressure and total temperature rakes downstream of each vane row were completed. Results show that wake width circumferential variability is more sensitive to spanwise location than wake depth variability. For this compressor with a pressure ratio of approximately 1.3 at peak efficiency, the observed efficiency variations based on pressure and temperature variations are on the order of three points for the overall compressor, but up to 15 points for individual stage efficiency. Additionally, vane wake variability implications on rotor forced response are explored. Results show that the measured levels of wake variability lead to more than a 60% difference in spectral magnitudes of the fundamental forcing frequency. Thus, the error associated with the difference between the measured wake and average wake should be considered when comparing measurements to computational results which often assume perfectly periodic geometry and uniform inlet conditions.",34,4
