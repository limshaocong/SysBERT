Further complicating this is that for passively fed electrospray thrusters, the mass flow rate, which is required to obtain the propulsion efficiency and specific impulse, is not directly controlled or measured, and so this parameter is typically estimated by assuming all mass loss is due to the emitted ion current. Presented here is a detailed investigation into the efficiencies associated with a porous-media-based electrospray thruster operated in the purely ionic regime using the ionic-liquid propellant 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate in both positive and negative ion emission modes. Measurements of performance metrics that affect thruster efficiency are discussed, including the transmission, angular, polydispersive, energy, and mass utilization efficiencies, in order to determine their impact on overall efficiency. The overall propulsion efficiency and specific impulse are also calculated using a variety of methods to better investigate how the assumptions made to estimate the mass flow rate affect these parameters. These results suggest that the efficiency of these devices may primarily be limited by the presence of additional mass loss mechanisms other than ion emission occurring during thruster operation.",37,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38244,"A computational and experimental study was conducted on nozzle geometries for rocket application rotating detonation engines (RDEs). Three geometries, including a nozzleless blunt body typically employed in RDE combustor hot-fire testing and two aerospike nozzles, were investigated. Simulations of the exhaust flow of a rotating high-frequency, high-pressure ratio wave based on rocket RDE test results were related to comparable constant-pressure conditions. Computational and experimental results showed the high momentum added by the highest-pressure detonation products influences the exhaust plume differently than a comparable steady flowfield fed by the same average product gas flow rate. In particular, the RDE exhaust flow tended to enhance entrainment on the nozzleless blunt body recirculation region and delay flow separation on nozzle expansion surfaces due to overexpansion compared to a constant-pressure engine. Results have important ramifications for isolating RDE combustor performance from nozzle effects and must be considered for future design of nozzle geometries to exploit the high-frequency, high-pressure ratio outflow of an RDE.",37,5

A 4.8 MPa (700 psia) axisymmetric kerosene– combustor used fuel-film cooling to deposit carbonaceous material on removable metal samples. Posttest inspection of the samples revealed a two-layer structure, with a tenacious dense lower layer and a soot-like upper layer. Total deposit depth was measured using an optical profilometer and was repeatable between tests at the same conditions. Combustor conditions of fuel-film flow rate, bipropellant run time, fuel composition, chamber liner material, and chamber liner surface roughness were varied to determine their effects on total carbonaceous deposit depth as a function of position and time. Increasing the fuel-film flow rate by 40% resulted in similar deposit depths to lower fuel-film flow rates, but for longer axial lengths. Longer run times resulted in thicker deposits. The use of lower thermal conductivity chamber liners resulted in three to four times more deposits.",37,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37765,"A generalized flat plate cascade model is used in this study to predict the unsteady aerodynamics of a vibrating blade row with nonuniform blade spacing in subsonic compressible flow. The blade row is assumed to vibrate in an isolated family of blade-dominated modes. The effect of nonuniform blade spacing on compressor rotor flutter stability is demonstrated by case studies based on the geometric and flow conditions of a high-speed three-stage axial research compressor. The results show that nonuniform blade spacing can greatly alter the blades’ aerodynamic damping. At certain vibrational nodal diameters, some blades are destabilized so much that their aerodamping becomes negative. However, negative aerodamping of some blades do not necessarily lead to the instability of the whole blade row. A general multibladed system aeroelastic model is derived to study the effects of the nonuniform blade spacing on rotor stability through an eigenvalue approach. The aerodynamic influence coefficients matrix can be calculated using the generalized flat plate cascade model for a blade row with any user-specified blade spacing patterns. The case studies investigated in this paper show that alternating blade spacing and shifting only one blade position can slightly increase the stability of the least-stable eigenmode, whereas sinusoidal blade spacing has a slightly destabilizing effect. On the other hand, the eigenvectors of the least-stable mode for the nonuniformly spaced blade rows can be significantly different from the uniform blade spacing case.",37,5

A total of nine formulations were examined: seven nonaluminized with varying AP distributions, concentrations, and average particle sizes, and two aluminized with varying aluminum concentrations. All nine propellants showed an exponent or “slope” break above 20 MPa (2900 psi) and a postbreak pressure exponent greater than one. Decreasing the AP particle size decreased both the characteristic pressure where the exponent break occurred (or ) and the pressure exponent after the break. AP distribution also affected , whereas changes in AP concentration did not. The inclusion of aluminum lowered compared with the nonaluminized formulations. Additionally, increasing the aluminum concentration appeared to lower the postbreak pressure exponent. The present study provides one of the first fundamental, systematic studies on the exponent break feature of AP/HTPB-composite propellants and adds new data to the limited database available in the open literature on the AP-based, composite propellant burning rate exponent break at very high pressures, with emphasis on the effect of mixture variables and Al on the characteristic break pressure and the postbreak pressure exponent.",37,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38231,"An experimental study is conducted to advance the understanding of flow physics associated with a boundary-layer ingesting, distributed propulsion system. The influence of incoming boundary-layer thickness on the performance of the system is examined. The propulsion model, integrated with electrical fans, is mounted on a flat plate and tested at subsonic speeds. Detailed characterization of the incoming boundary layer and the downstream flowfield is performed using hot-wire anemometry and static pressure measurements. Modification of the boundary layer is achieved by placing trip rods of two different diameters near the leading edge of the flat plate. Overall performance of the system is analyzed by estimating thrust, flow power, and input power to the fans. Ingestion of a thicker boundary layer is found to result in an increase in thrust and net flow power.",37,5

The aim of this work was to select a specific catalyst bed geometry for the thruster system and to investigate more general methodologies for monopropellant packed catalyst bed optimization. Characteristic velocity efficiencies approaching 0.98 were demonstrated, and performance improved for smaller beds with low aspect ratios; although, these beds flooded at lower propellant flow rates. The onset of bed flooding was used to identify physical limits of propellant flow rate supported by the catalyst. The particular propellant–catalyst pairing limit was defined by a Damköhler number of 56, independent of the bed geometry, with thermal performance peaking for the high flow rates just before flooding occurred. It is suggested that this method is extensible to other monopropellant systems, although with further work required to confirm it is a more general effect beyond thrusters using hydrogen peroxide.",37,5
