0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35129,"The influence of initial propellant temperature on solid propellant rocket motor performance is examined in the present study, with the focus primarily on predicted steady and nonsteady burning rate behavior. The present evaluation includes an examination of quasi-steady burning of a conventional composite propellant under pressure, core flow (erosive burning), and normal acceleration (say, due to motor spinning). The most direct and well-known influence of initial propellant temperature is on the pressure-dependent burning rate. The pressure-dependent burning rate, as the base burning rate, in turn influences the degree of augmentation seen under core flow and normal acceleration; in general, the lower the base rate, the higher the augmentation. The explicit presence of initial propellant temperature in various model equations for the flow- and acceleration-dependent burning components, and the corresponding effect of the initial temperature on the propellant’s burning surface temperature, can produce an overall compounding effect that adds to the nominal augmentation produced by the base burning rate value. The same considerations apply when one moves from quasi-steady to transient operational conditions, where the transient burning rate response of the solid propellant (which is a function of the quasi-steady burning rate components, as well as the initial temperature of the propellant) can be modified significantly by varying the propellant’s initial temperature.",30,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35236,"This paper reports the development of a nonaluminized composite solid-propellant formulation with high burning rates. To achieve high burning rates, potassium (described in the literature as an impurity) has been doped into ammonium perchlorate. It is seen that beyond a potassium content of 0.19% the increase in the burning rates of a composite propellant is not significant. A high-burn-rate pressure index at high pressures and the dual slope has been observed with the potassium doped ammonium perchlorate in a composite solid propellant even with the use of only fine sized ammonium perchlorate particles. These features have been explained through surface scanning electron microscope pictures of quenched propellant samples.",30,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35107,"Fully integrated computational simulations inside solid-propellant rockets are carried out to examine the nonlinear feedback interaction between fluid, structure, and burning module. The arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian description is employed to efficiently track the burning process along the grain surface. An automatic remeshing algorithm is added to the fluid, structure, and burning process to accurately analyze unsteady fluid–structure coupling phenomena with deforming solid grain during the simulation. The developed solver is then applied to the full-burning simulation of a solid-propellant grain, which is a highly coupled unsteady phenomenon between the gas flow and propellant structure. Based on the integrated computed results, the detailed burning mechanism and flame propagation process along the propellant grain surface are investigated. In particular, flame propagation delay and secondary burning phenomena are explained from the physical and numerical perspectives. Furthermore, the virtual contact line method is introduced to overcome the boots contact problem occurring in the gas flow–propellant interaction, and the deforming behavior of the full-burning solid propellant is examined.",30,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35084,"Response surface methods were applied to a model for regression rate of the solid fuel grain in a mixed oxidizer hybrid rocket. A Monte Carlo simulation-based uncertainty analysis was developed and applied to experimentally determine response surface coefficients and was further integrated into maximization and optimization runs to provide bounding upper and lower uncertainty limits on burning rate as a function of grain composition and motor operating conditions. The regression or burning rate model incorporates motor chamber pressure and injected gaseous oxidizer mass flux as well as solid-propellant formulation effects. Existing experimental data were used to determine model parameters, which subsequently framed a set of optimization case scenarios for maximization of regression rate and exploration of mixture and operational space with specified burning rate constraints. Line contour and response surface plots were generated to aid in visualization of results, including plots of nominal upper and lower uncertainties of burning rate as a function of composition at 95% confidence level. This analysis determines the optimum solid-propellant fuel compositions to optimize the regression rate of a mixed-oxidizer hybrid grain under specified operating conditions.",30,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34975,"In this paper, an attempt is made to increase the regression rate of the hybrid fuel (paraffin wax) using a hemispherical bluff body placed near the head end of the motor. The oxidizer used for the present study is gaseous oxygen. The results show that the use of a bluff body increases the regression rate by around two times at the higher and by around three to four times at the lower . This increase in regression rate diminishes as the of the motor is increased from 9 to 27, whilst still being higher than the case without bluff body. The bluff body was seen to increase the regression rate even at a port diameter, which was four times the initial port diameter of 15 mm. The was nearly constant for the case with the bluff body, whilst for the case without the bluff body, it increased from 1.5 to 2 during an operation time of 4.5 s. In addition, the port diameter after combustion was nearly uniform from the head end to the nozzle end as compared to the case when no bluff body was used, thus minimizing the sliver losses.",30,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35140,"The present study experimentally investigates dynamic characteristics of combustion occurring at highly excessive oxygen environments. Combustion experiments burning kerosene and liquid oxygen were conducted at chamber pressures of 5–20 MPa, and their dynamic pressure fluctuations were measured. The systematic analysis of pressure data confirms that the combustion is sound, with root-mean-square values below 3% of chamber pressures, except a single condition of a chamber pressure of 8.9 MPa, at which low-frequency bulk mode combustion instability at 78 Hz spontaneously occurred. The application of nonlinear time-series analysis shows that certain hidden nonlinear behaviors can be identified, implying that they may be used for the assessment of a combustion stability margin.",30,4

This paper presents a qualitative analysis of the impact of preignition pressures, propellant injection conditions and injection phenomena such as flash evaporation, the local chamber flowfield, and propellant mass flow stability on altitude ignition. The use of test sequences and encountered phenomena to control the ignition delay and energy deposition and ignition overpressure is addressed.",30,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35091,"Thrust measurements are essential to qualify thrusters for space missions, especially for new technologies. In the framework of the Gaia mission, the 13 newly developed cold gas micronewton thrusters from Thales Alenia Space Italia (TAS-I) were subjected to acceptance tests on the micronewton thrust balance of ONERA in order to measure their thrust noise and specific impulse curve. The balance, based on the principle of a pendulum, has a high-thrust resolution (less than ), with a thrust noise of in the range of 0.02–1 Hz. The calibration of the balance is presented, and the postprocessing corrections leading to this performance are detailed. The specific impulse of the 13 cold gas micronewton thrusters flight models has been measured for thrust levels in the range of , showing a slight increase of from around 50 to 63 s with thrust for all flight models.",30,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35080,"Experimental tests are conducted to evaluate two rocket exhaust configurations within an Rocket-Based Combined Cycle engine model. Each configuration uses a single rocket chamber but expands the rocket exhaust to a different geometry. One configuration uses two traditional circular rocket nozzles whereas the other uses two annular exhaust geometries based on the Exchange Inlet design. Wall pressure data are collected along the length of each configuration to evaluate the air entrainment. The annular configuration is shown to increase the entrainment ratio by as much as 28% over the traditional circular rocket design. The annular configuration is also shown to choke the incoming airflow at a lower rocket chamber pressure more uniformly across the engine cross section. Total pressure measurements are also obtained at the engine exit plane, which show that the annular configuration yields an average Mach number 57% higher than the circular configuration under conditions close to those for maximum air entrainment.",30,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35115,"An extensive experimental investigation has been conducted to assess the feasibility of implementing laser ignition in a cryogenic reaction and control system and orbital and maneuvering system thrusters. A 400 N experimental thruster, with a single-coaxial injector element, was designed for a steady-state pressure of 2 bar and was tested using two laser ignition systems: a tabletop laser as well as a miniaturized laser, which was mounted onto the thruster. Chamber pressures in the thruster before ignition varied from 200 mbar for liquid oxygen/gaseous methane to 450 mbar for liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen. The locations of energy deposition and the energy deposited were varied to determine the associated ignition probabilities for the propellant combinations liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen/gaseous methane. Plasma ignition and ablation ignition were both examined. For 100% ignition success, minimum energies measured were lower for liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (72 mJ) than for liquid oxygen/gaseous methane (92 mJ), and they were lower for ablation (14.5 mJ for liquid oxygen/gaseous hydrogen and 61.7 mJ for liquid oxygen/gaseous methane) than plasma ignition. The feasibility of laser ignition for cryogenic thrusters was demonstrated, and further investigation needs were revealed.",30,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35149,"The paper is concerned with the formulation and validation of an efficient, flexible, and reliable method to assess the influence of resonator rings on combustion dynamics in rocket thrust chambers. The chamber is modeled as a network of low-order acoustic elements that describe three-dimensional waves in cylindrical duct segments with nontrivial boundary conditions and mean flow. The main elements responsible for (thermo)acoustic driving and damping, such as time-lagged fluctuating heat release, injector plate, and short exit nozzle are considered. Particular attention is given to the formulation of a semianalytical resonator ring model, which is capable of handling transverse waves, mode coupling, and mode scattering. A Nyquist plot method based on control theory, which is considerably more efficient than classical root finding techniques, is used to identify the eigenmodes and growth rates of the system. After validating the Nyquist method against analytical results, the stabilizing influence of resonator rings is demonstrated through a representative test case. The key mechanisms induced by the resonator ring that lead to stabilization are also discussed. The proposed method is capable to predict linear stability and give insight in the three-dimensional pressure distribution with very moderate computational effort that allows parametric studies.",30,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35146,"This paper is a compilation of the research efforts of five different groups (Bertin Technologies with Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales, Institut de Mécanique des Fluides de Toulouse, ONERA, Purdue University, and Technische Universität München) on the prediction of combustion instabilities in a model rocket engine. This research was initiated by the Rocket Engine Stability Initiative group for the 2nd Rocket Engine Stability Initiative Workshop on Combustion Instability Modeling, which took place in October 2010 at Astrium, GmbH, in Ottobrunn, Germany. The target experiment consists of a single shear coaxial injector using methane and decomposed hydrogen peroxide as reactants. Both the inlet of the injector and the outlet of the chamber are choked, resulting in well-defined acoustic boundary conditions. The length of the oxidizer tube could be varied continuously, and its influence on the stability is studied. Many numerical strategies are tested, addressing different physical phenomena at play during unstable combustion. Acoustic solvers, both with and without mean-flow effects are used to draw stability maps. The weak spot of these solvers is that they require the flame response to acoustic perturbations as an input. Large-eddy simulations, requiring no such a priori knowledge, are performed with the intent to elucidate flame stabilization and flame response mechanisms.",30,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35003,"A rectangular combustor with acoustic forcing was used to study flame–acoustic interaction under injection conditions that are representative of liquid propellant rocket engines. Hot-fire tests using liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen were conducted at pressures of 40 and 60 bar, which are sub- and supercritical conditions, respectively, for oxygen. Examined samples of hydroxyl-radical emission imaging, collected using a high-speed camera during periods of forced acoustic resonance, showed significant response in the multi-injection element flame. Fluctuating acoustic pressure causes in-phase fluctuation of the emission intensity, producing response factor values of around 0.8. Transverse acoustic velocity causes shortening of the flame, concentrating heat release near the injection plane. The flame is also convectively displaced with transverse acoustic velocity, a process believed by many to be responsible for driving transverse mode high-frequency combustion instabilities. The analysis in this work was extended to detect the response of internal flame processes to the transverse acoustic disturbance, namely, pressure response and enhanced transport and mixing of non-premixed propellants. A flame-tracking technique was implemented to isolate the response of these processes from that of collective convective displacement. The results show a significant contribution to overall flame response from the response of internal processes; however, further work is required to quantify the relative contributions of pressure or propellant transport.",30,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35162,"The birthplace of modern combustors, the Rijke tube, is considered in this paper. The findings of earlier investigations are used as the departure point, and a complementary analytical approach is introduced for predicting its thermoacoustic instability with experimental validations. In the core of the novel analytical work resides a unique mathematical tool that evolved only within the last decade. It is called the cluster treatment of characteristic roots paradigm, which uniquely reveals the stable operating regions for thermoacoustic instability in the space of the operational parameters, such as geometric dimensions or thermal parameters. For linearizable systems, these stability regions are declared exhaustively and nonconservatively. The experimental validation of this analytical approach is the primary contribution of the present paper. The main intention of this paper is to supplement the combustion science literature with the analytical capabilities of cluster treatment of characteristic roots.",30,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35105,"Impinging-jet injectors are commonly used in liquid-propellant rocket engines. Previous theoretical studies on sheets formed by two impinging liquid jets have largely ignored the affect of liquid viscosity, however, several experimental results have illustrated that liquid viscosity could greatly influence sheet characteristics. This paper proposes an improved theoretical analysis model for two viscous liquid impinging jets, in which viscosity and energy dissipation are taken into account; experiments were also performed to validate the theory. Furthermore, based on this model, the effects of impingement angle, jet velocity profile, Weber number, and Reynolds number on sheet characteristics, such as sheet shape, thickness, and velocity distribution, were investigated.",30,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35093,"This paper presents methods used to investigate the combustion behavior of liquid monopropellants with or without additives, with a focus on nanoscale particles as burning rate modifiers in nitromethane. The combined effects of nanoscale aluminum and fumed silica on the burning rate were tested at pressures ranging from 3 to 13 MPa, using a pressure-based technique. Distinct differences in burning rate were observed between burns using a quartz-lined cavity and those employing steel. An analytical model was used to estimate the temperature profiles of quartz, steel, and layered strand burner tubes, indicating that the higher burning rates measured in the steel cavity were likely caused by a combination of heat transfer and catalytic effects. A mixture of 1% silica, 5% aluminum, and 94% nitromethane by weight produced burning rates that were 60–70% higher than those of neat nitromethane across the range of pressures. The close match between the burning rates of neat nitromethane gathered in this study and those taken from other researchers proves the utility of the pressure-based method, whereas the consistently measured burning rates of the aluminum and silica mixture prove the versatility of the method when extended to tests on suspended-particle mixtures.",30,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35071,"An experimental investigation was conducted to discover the characteristics of a cryogenic swirl flow at subcritical to supercritical conditions. In the experiment, liquid nitrogen was injected into a high-pressure chamber through an open-type simplex swirl injector. The flow was imaged by high-speed photography, and the instability frequency was measured by the laser beam diagnostics of the flow. Comparing the flow images of the cryogenic and conventional swirl flows, different behaviors were noted, and it was hypothesized that the instability of the cryogenic swirl flow was dominated by the precessing vortex core in the central toroidal recirculation zone. When the ambient condition of the flow was changed from subcritical to supercritical, the phase change and subsequent density change of the injectant differed, and flow actions, such as the behavior of the downstream flow, the spray angle, the wavelength, and the propagation velocity, changed drastically. When measuring the frequency of the flow instability, it was found to correspond to that of the precessing vortex core instability. The frequency decreased with the ambient pressure due to the decreasing flow velocity, but it did not change drastically when the surrounding conditions changed from subcritical to supercritical. This implies that the interface of the flow is highly affected by the density of the phase-changed injectant, but that the instability of the flow is determined by the flow in a liquid state.",30,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35061,"Stabilized aluminum flames are studied in the products of methane combustion. A premixed methane–air Bunsen flame is seeded with increasing concentrations of micron-size aluminum powder, and scanning emission spectroscopy is used to determine the flame temperature via both the continuous and aluminum monoxide spectra. The flame burning velocity is measured and the condensed flame products are collected and analyzed for unburned metallic aluminum content. It was observed that, below a critical concentration of about , aluminum demonstrates incomplete oxidation with a flame temperature close to the methane–air flame. Below the critical concentration, the flame burning velocity also decreases similar to a flame seeded with inert silicon carbide particles. In contrast, at aluminum concentrations above the critical value, an aluminum flame front rapidly forms and is coupled to the methane flame. The flame temperature of the coupled methane–aluminum flame is close to equilibrium values with aluminum as a reactant, and the flame burning velocity remains flat for increasing aluminum concentrations. A simple theoretical estimation, which assumes that the aluminum reaction rate is controlled by the kinetic evaporation of aluminum, adequately predicts the critical concentration range at which the aluminum flame front can be coupled with the methane flame.",30,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35130,"The development of three-stream variable-cycle turbofan engines for tactical aircraft provides an opportunity for noise reduction by shaping the exhaust of the secondary and tertiary streams. The paper reviews an experimental study of subscale three-stream jets operating at high specific thrust and issuing from rapid-prototyped nozzles. Exhaust conditions at four set points, with variable tertiary pressure ratio and bypass ratio, were determined using thermodynamic cycle analysis. Nozzles were fabricated for each set point and featured coaxial and non-coaxial exit geometries. The operating conditions were simulated using precisely metered helium–air mixtures, and far-field noise surveys were collected using a 24-microphone array. For a low-bypass ratio, a coaxial configuration offers no significant noise benefit compared to the single-stream primary jet. Configurations with offset secondary or tertiary streams offer significant noise reduction in the direction of the thicker flow. For an overall bypass ratio around 0.5, reductions of 5.1 dB in overall sound pressure level and 4.2 dB in effective perceived noise level were attained.",30,4
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35007,"Detailed x-ray radiographic experiments were conducted to evaluate the time-averaged spray characteristics of a liquid rocket swirl injector. Sprays issued from a single liquid-centered swirl coaxial element—with and without coannular gas flow—were exposed to focused, monochromatic x rays produced by a synchrotron light source. Two-dimensional attenuation data are presented at various axial stations and reveal both projected mass distribution of liquid in the injector near field and mass-weighted axial velocity integrated over time. Measurements describing spray morphology are also inferred from the x-ray data and compared with those measured through objective image processing of visible light imagery. The gas flow is observed to reduce spray cone angle up to 50% and increase liquid film thickness up to 20% in the near field. Measurements compare well with those extracted from imagery of the pressure-swirl spray; however, the x-ray technique is more robust in resolving liquid film thickness for the optically dense swirl coaxial spray.",30,4
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B35126,"For external convective heat transfer, a common assumption based on the conventional wisdom is that aerodynamics determines the heat transfer coefficient without being affected by wall temperature. In this paper, a systematic computational study has been carried out on the effects of the wall thermal boundary condition on the external heat transfer coefficient for a two-dimensional nozzle guide vane section. Heat transfer coefficients are worked out first in a typical uncoupled manner with specified wall temperatures. As an alternative verification of the findings, further computations are also made using the coupled solid–fluid conjugate heat transfer mode of the solver. The present results show a strong dependence of heat transfer coefficient on wall temperature, in a locally varying manner, which cannot be corrected by using the existing correlations based on a global correction. A detailed examination of the boundary layer highlights the impact of upstream cooling history on the local heat transfer coefficient distribution. Following on these findings, a new three-point nonlinear method to obtain the heat transfer coefficient is proposed. In this method, the heat transfer coefficient has been considered to vary with wall temperature rather than being independent of it as normally assumed. Heat transfer coefficient predictions for different wall temperatures have been compared between the conventional two-point method and the newly proposed one. The effectiveness of the new method has been clearly demonstrated.",30,4
