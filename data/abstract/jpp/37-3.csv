This Paper presents a model of a synergistic gas turbine/solid oxide fuel cell system for combined propulsion and electrical power on aircraft. It is developed using Numerical Propulsion System Simulation and features realistic representations of the engine, reformer (a catalytic partial oxidation reactor), solid oxide fuel cell, and external aerodynamic losses. The results show that incorporating the reformer and fuel cell directly into the engine’s flowpath reduces vehicle-level fuel consumption of a high-altitude long-endurance aircraft at cruise by at least 8% when the engine is mounted inside the fuselage and at least 4% when the engine is installed within a nacelle. It also increases electrical generation capability by factors of 2 or more versus engine-driven mechanical generators in several aircraft applications. The main limitation in nacelle-mounted applications is increased external aerodynamic drag associated with the protrusion of the fuel cell into the flow around the engine, but it is shown that this can be mitigated through tight integration with high-pressure-ratio engines and careful flowpath design.",37,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38128,"A variety of methods have been developed to enhance solid propellant burning rates, including adjusting oxidizer particle size, changing the formulation, modifying the propellant core geometry, and adding catalysts or wires. Fully consumable reactive wires embedded in propellant have been demonstrated to increase the burning rate by increasing the surface area; however, the observation of this effect has been limited to viewing via an intrusive window next to the wire. Here, dynamic X-ray radiography is employed to analyze the evolution of the internal burning profile of propellant embedded with additively manufactured reactive components. This avoids heat loss at the window and allows analysis of the three-dimensional volumetric consumption of strands with internal branching geometries. Printable reactive wires made of aluminum/polyvinylidene fluoride were embedded as single wires, pitchforks, and U- and V-shaped geometries. The nano-aluminum-based formulation produced cone-shaped burning surfaces at 1 atm without the ejection of unburned propellant, even for multiple wires burning in close proximity. The results demonstrate a route to preferentially tailor the internal burning profile of propellants with embedded printable reactive wires and a dynamic X-ray imaging technique to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the complex internal perforation development.",37,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37891,"The present paper numerically investigates the rotating stall mechanism in the NASA CC3 transonic centrifugal compressor with wedge-type vaned diffuser. The three-dimensional compressible, unsteady Navier–Stokes equations have been applied to a full-annulus high-speed centrifugal compressor comprising an inlet duct, impeller, and vaned diffuser. The scale-adaptive simulation model is selected as the turbulent closure model. The aim of this paper is to predict and capture the key features of rotating stall in a transonic high-pressure centrifugal compressor based on the scale-adaptive simulation approach. First, the steady numerical model was validated by the experiment for the aerodynamic compressor performance at different operating conditions from choke to surge. Then, unsteady simulations were conducted near the surge point to propose a detailed analysis of stall characteristics within the compressor diffuser passages. Comparison of the unsteady pressure signals with those of the measurement data revealed that the numerical results matched well with the experimental data to capture the rotating speed of the stall cells. Time/space analysis of transient entropy production distribution was performed within the diffuser passages to show the stall behavior and to confirm the existence and development of rotating stall cells during the impeller revolutions. Evaluation of the spectral analysis of the computed pressure fluctuation by the current numerical approach showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data for blade passing and rotating stall frequencies. The present paper demonstrates that the current numerical model is a beneficial engineering approach to provide accurate solutions compared to experimental data for prediction of the rotating stall as well as to resolve the unsteady turbulence structures.",37,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37683,"A rocket–ramjet combined cycle engine model, embedding twin rocket chambers driven with gaseous hydrogen and oxygen on the top wall side of a scramjet flowpath, was tested in its ejector-mode operation under sea-level static conditions. Gaseous hydrogen was also injected through secondary injector orifices to pressurize a ramjet combustor located downstream of the rocket chambers. Mixing between the hot rocket plume and cold airflow as well as combustion of residual fuel within the plume with the airflow caused entropy and static pressure increases in the constant-area mixing duct in the original flowpath design, resulting in a limited airflow rate. The mixing duct was redesigned to incorporate divergence from its onset to counter the pressure rise. With the diverging flowpath configuration, the airflow rate was increased by 40 percent. However, this modified flowpath geometry resulted in the formation of a low-speed area, through which the pressure rise in the ramjet combustor penetrated the mixing duct and reduced the incoming airflow rate. Without mechanical contraction near the engine exit, increasing pressure in the diverging portion of the flowpath was difficult, which in turn, resulted in poor mixing between the airflow and the rocket plume. Balancing these factors and additional mixing enhancement are required. The engine performance is then summarized.",37,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37998,"Two analytical models for computing the pumping speed of a vacuum chamber are derived. The models focus on the vacuum systems used for testing electric propulsion devices. The node model is based on a well-known calculation of the effective pumping speed adjusted by the conductance between the pump and the measurement location. The flux model is derived by balancing particle fluxes at two temperatures: one at the ambient condition, such as the chamber walls; and the second at a cold temperature, indicative of a cryopump surface. The flux model also takes into account gas–wall interaction. The flux model formalism is reduced to solving a linear system of flux transfer matrices for a vacuum chamber section. Simple linear mathematical manipulations allow computing of the pumping speed of complex vacuum chamber shapes. Both models produce a good agreement with the experimentally measured pumping speed for two chambers investigated in this paper.",37,3

Previously, the proof-of-principle demonstration of PLT used a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) rod gain medium and resulted in the maximum thrust of . This Paper reports 100 times scaling up of PLT using a ytterbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Yb:YAG) thin-disk gain medium and thought first demonstration of propelling and stopping a 0.75 kg mock cube satellite over 2 m in a Class-1000 cleanroom. A thrust stand for PLT was established with a radiation pressure sensor that reduced the thermal convection effect and the configuration complexity. The maximum achieved thrust and specific thrust were and , respectively. Further development of PLT using existing high-power laser technologies is projected to increase its specific thrust to , on a par with electric thrusters. The present results conclude that innovative PLT applications, such as propellant-free orbit maneuvering and stationkeeping, are within the reach of existing spacecraft and high-power laser technologies. In addition, the feasibility of PLT-based launchers and landers is discussed.",37,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38066,"An experimental investigation into small pressure-swirl spill-return atomizers was made to determine the effect of the entry port number, swirl-chamber shape, spill-line design, and the manufacturing precision on the spray quality and stability. The atomizers were studied using phase-Doppler anemometry, high-speed visualization, and mechanical patternation. Jet A-1 fuel was sprayed at inlet pressures of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MPa and for spill-to-feed ratios of 0, 0.4, and 0.8. The chamber shape influenced the spray characteristics of the simplex atomizers only moderately with no systematic effect of conical chambers to the others. The spray was found to be circumferentially heterogeneous; its uniformity improved with increase in the pressure, while the effect of swirling port number was negligible. Atomizers with axial spill orifice demonstrated strong spray pulsations at a spill-to-feed ratio of zero. A periodic decay of the air core was identified as a possible reason for the pulsations. Atomizers with off-axis spill orifices always produced a stable spray. Atomizers with tangential inlet ports provided a finer spray than those with helical ports. Manufacturing precision, axial symmetry, and matching of the surfaces of connected parts were found important for the spray symmetry and homogeneity.",37,3

The developed sled test demonstrator contained all onboard subsystems, including engine, gas cylinders, valves, controller, and a data logger. The sled test demonstrator successfully generated thrust, and three or four detonation waves of 1460 to were observed during the 2.0 s burn time. The measured specific impulse in the sled test was 144 s as estimated from the acceleration of the demonstrator and the mass decrease in the onboard cylinders. The test results were compared with the data from a laboratory-stand firing test using a load cell, and the specific impulses of the sled test were found to be comparable to the results of the stand firing test.",37,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38069,"Flow visualization experiments, pressure and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were conducted in supersonic internal compression inlet models in a Mach 2 flow. In the first phase of the study, the inlet model having a single sharp-edged shock generator on the upper lip of the inlet was investigated. In the second phase, another ramp was added to the floor of the single-ramp inlet model in order to fully represent an internal compression inlet. A block piece is placed at the exit of the inlet channel to simulate the pressure condition caused by the presence of the diffuser and engine. Schlieren imaging method was used to obtain the multishock wave flow pattern within the models. Fluctuating pressure measurements were performed on the floor of the inlet models. Mean velocity field at the center plane section of the inlet is obtained by side-view PIV measurements. Moreover, mean total and static pressures were measured at the exit section of the models in order to assess the total pressure recovery and exit Mach distribution of the inlet configurations. Results show that in general the double-ramp model flow field exhibits relatively smaller unsteady pressure fluctuations and hence a better performance.",37,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37938,"The T6 ion thruster is providing in-space propulsion for the BepiColombo mission, currently en route to Mercury. Simulations of the accelerator grid erosion during flight operation were carried out using the CEX2D and CEX3D codes in order to verify that the grid lifetime will be sufficient to impart the 5.75 total impulse per thruster required for the mission. Before calculating in-space erosion rates, the models were benchmarked against data from long-duration wear tests. Two-dimensional simulations tracked the time-dependent grid geometry and calculated changes in the electron backstreaming limit as the grids eroded. Sensitivity studies assessed the impact of uncertainty in the operating screen-to-accelerator grid gap on . Three-dimensional simulations employed a particle-in-cell model for the charge exchange ions and were able to accurately reproduce the nonaxisymmetric pits and grooves erosion pattern observed on the downstream face of the accelerator grid following ground testing. Charge exchange ion space charge effects were found to broaden the pit erosion features in flight, further reducing the peak erosion rate relative to that observed on the ground. The simulations predicted that T6 will have sufficient margin against both electron backstreaming and accelerator grid wearthrough over the duration of the mission.",37,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38043,"Experimental investigations on the self-pulsation dynamics in a gas-centered swirl coaxial atomizer are conducted using water and air. Experiments are performed in the pulsation regime by precisely varying the momentum flux ratio for different values of swirl number, recess length, and lip thickness. High-speed imaging is used to understand the underlying mechanism of the onset of pulsation. While the transition to the pulsation regime takes a route of intermittency in a nonrecessed injector, the transition in a recessed injector is seen to be spontaneous. The spray width fluctuates significantly in the pulsation regime, and hence the temporal variation in the spray width is used to characterize the pulsation frequencies. Three factors, the constrained shear layer instability between the liquid and the gas streams inside the recess region, the spread rate of the gas jet, and its interaction location with the liquid stream, are shown to dictate the presence of dominant pulsation frequencies and even their higher harmonics in many recessed configurations. It is further shown that the nondimensional pulsation frequency depends only on the lip thickness and is independent of the flow and other geometrical parameters of the injector considered in the present paper.",37,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B37959,"The performance (specific impulse, ) of a modular, -class rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) was measured with three gaseous fuels (methane, ethane, and ethylene) and gaseous oxygen over a wide range of flow rates and equivalence ratios. All tests exhausted to sea level backpressure and were conducted using a calibrated thrust stand and Coriolis mass flow meters. Configurations tested included a straight, open annulus, as well as several converging/diverging annular nozzles. Throughout testing, wave numbers observed via high-speed video varied from 5 to 8 waves, whereas wave speeds varied from 60 to 72% of ideal Chapman–Jouguet velocities. Measured performance ranged from 68 to 85% of ideal liquid rocket engine (deflagration engine) sea-level performance, based on comparisons to ideal NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Applications performance estimates. Additionally, an altitude compensating aerospike nozzle increased performance by 10–13%. Several constricting annular exits were also tested, and yielded increased with decreasing flow area. Direct detonation upset tests revealed remarkable combustion stability, and extended pulse-mode firings demonstrated the potential for RDREs as attitude control thrusters.",37,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38204,"In recent years, there has been significantly increased interest in using nitrous oxide as an oxidizer in hybrid rocket motor systems. The attraction of nitrous oxide is its low relative toxicity and high vapor pressure, potentially enabling self-pressurizing systems. Its decomposition is highly exothermic with a large energy barrier, typically requiring high temperature (700°C) to achieve appreciable decomposition rates. One solution is to use a catalyst to enable decomposition at significantly lower temperatures. This Paper uses a commercially available rhodium-based catalyst in a custom test cell to decompose nitrous oxide at temperatures well below the uncatalyzed self-sustaining decomposition temperature. This Paper also demonstrates that decomposition using the tested catalyst is direct to and at all temperature ranges observed and is incomplete with residual present at lower temperatures. Further, this Paper couples our test cell with a counterflow burner to ignite and burn hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene fuel with the decomposed nitrous oxide and evaluate performance via fuel regression rate at a variety of conditions. The fuel autoignites when the gas exit temperature reaches 750°C, and regression rate is shown to increase with both mass flux and temperature.",37,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38133,"The lean blow-off (LBO) limits and structure of turbulent premixed flames were investigated with vaporized liquid fuels stabilized by a bluff-body burner. Ethanol, heptane, and two kerosenes were used. To facilitate comparisons to gaseous-fueled flames, results were also obtained from methane flames. The measured LBO limits indicate that, for this burner, the ethanol and heptane flames are more resilient to blow-off than the kerosene fuels. Furthermore, a correlation based on a Damköhler number , which is proportional to the laminar flame speed, does not lead to the successful collapse of the different fuels, indicating that the correlations based on laminar flame speed are not applicable. Average OH* chemiluminescence images of the ethanol and heptane flames are qualitatively similar to that from methane: the flame brushes of both exhibit an M shape when close to blow-off. In contrast, the distribution of OH* signal in the kerosene flames is primarily concentrated in regions further downstream of the bluff body. Ultimately, the results of this effort highlight the influence fuel type has on the LBO of bluff-body stabilized flames. Moreover, this work indicates the LBO behavior of flames produced with complex hydrocarbon fuels cannot be fully understood via high-temperature chemistry concepts such as the laminar flame speed.",37,3
