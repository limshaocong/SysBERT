This paper reports the discovery of the enhancement of the performance of ammonium perchlorate-based composite propellants by means of employing mesoporous copper oxide powder as a new burning rate catalyst in comparison to conventional (nonporous) copper oxide fillers. The burning rate measurements, obtained by the strand burner method, show that, with the addition of mesoporous fillers of copper oxide in aluminized composite propellants, higher rates (in excess of at 7 MPa) are found over a broad pressure range. It was noticed that these high burning rates were accompanied by a more stable combustion, decreasing considerably the pressure index (0.40 versus 0.55). The thermal characterization of these highly energetic composite materials was also carried out by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, demonstrating that the incorporation of mesoporous copper oxide particles in the formulations improves their combustion behavior, shifting the temperature decomposition peak toward a lower temperature and decreasing the activation energy. The results presented here reveal the advantages exhibited by the use of these mesoporous particles as an additive for solid rocket propulsion technology.",29,2

Under the assumption of stress sensors evenly distributed along the circumference of the interface between the propellant and insulation, a relationship is established between the debond angle, the number of sensors, and the required sensor accuracy. Two approaches are proposed to detect debonds based on the radial stress readings from these embedded sensors. In addition, a quantitative mapping is obtained between the debond size and the sensor data to inversely estimate the extent of the delamination. It is demonstrated that the proposed framework can detect delaminations in solid rocket motors.",29,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34544,"The transient burning parameters of an RDX–XLDB propellant were determined experimentally using a strand burner. Experiments were conducted under various conditions ( of 0.1–15 MPa, and of , 25, and 65°C). A few distinct burning regimes were observed. At pressures between 0.1 and 1.5 MPa, the pressure exponent was found to be around 0.7. Between 1.5 and 2.5 MPa, there was a drop in the burn rate that could not be fitted to burn laws. In the range of 2.5–8 MPa, the exponent was 0.4. Between 8 and 12 MPa, a plateau regime was detected, whereas the exponent recovered its positive value above 12 MPa. A stability analysis based on the Zeldovich–Novozhilov approach was performed for various conditions. For operating pressures around 7 MPa, the propellant response was rather low (about 20% of the steady-state value). At lower pressures, the propellant exhibited a higher response (up to 400% of the steady-state value) at acoustic frequencies under 1 kHz. The diversity of burning regimes was attributed to the differences in the deflagration process of XLDB with nitramine oxidizer over a wide pressure range.",29,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34611,"In this paper, viscometry, yield stress, and small shear strain oscillation experiments on monomethylhydrazine gels are presented. The goal is to define a gel formulation with a measurable yield stress under low-shear conditions and shear-thinning behavior at shear rates representative of typical rocket injectors. Hydroxypropylcellulose, fumed silica, and a hybrid of the two materials are investigated as gelling agents for monomethylhydrazine. The two gel formulations that included hydroxypropylcellulose exhibited similar shear-thinning behavior with power-law flow indices of to 0.2. The pure fumed silica gel samples exhibited highly shear-thinning behavior with negative power-law flow indices indicative of thixotropic behavior. Tests performed after a preshear cycle showed shear-thinning power-law flow indices of . Unlike the pure hydroxypropylcellulose and hybrid gels, the fumed silica gel exhibited a well-defined, measureable yield stress. Small-strain oscillatory experiments showed that hydroxypropylcellulose and hybrid gels behave like linear viscoelastic liquids below a critical strain value, whereas the fumed silica gel behaves like a viscoelastic solid with a distinguishable yield stress. The phase angle of these gelled propellants is also discussed as a function of frequency, as are the implications of these results to the physical processes of interest.",29,2

Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide yields a high-temperature oxygen-steam mixture, which can be used as monopropellant or as oxidizer in a bipropellant configuration. This work examines different types of cellular ceramic-based catalysts for hydrogen-peroxide decomposition at miniature scale of nominal mass flows of . An exhaustive investigation of different catalysts in a flow reactor configuration similar to a propulsion application is conducted. The test matrix includes honeycomb monoliths with different channel geometries, densities, lengths, different carrier materials, and wash-coating procedures, as well as different types of catalysts such as pellets and foams. Thirty nine catalyst configurations with a total of 121 catalysts have been experimentally investigated based on their transient and stationary performance at design mass-flow levels of .",29,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34627,"The processes leading to the hypergolic ignition of monomethyl hydrazine and red fuming nitric acid have been the subject of several studies. Whereas drop test experiments provide the scale necessary for detailed observations, they typically rely on the impact of a fuel droplet moving at its terminal velocity and an oxidizer pool contained within a crucible. By controlling the kinetic energy and the size of the fuel droplet, effectively varying the Weber number of the fuel droplet, precise amounts of reactants can be made to react at a defined location, thus, increasing the repeatability of the experiment. With an unrestrained oxidizer pool, the reaction can be made to resemble that occurring in a combustion chamber. In this study, the collisions of fuel droplets, limited to a Weber number below 12, with unrestrained red fuming nitric acid pools within a dry nitrogen environment were observed. The postprocessing of high-speed visible and infrared movies revealed that, under most conditions, explosion events precede the ignition of the propellants. The explosions result in vigorous secondary atomization, creating micron-sized drops that evaporate rapidly and serve as ignition sources. The presence and behavior of these micron-sized drops is believed to play a critical role in ignition.",29,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34341,"Imidazole-based ionic liquids are investigated in terms of dual-mode chemical monopropellant and electrospray rocket propulsion capabilities. A literature review of ionic liquid physical properties is conducted to determine an initial, representative set of ionic liquids that shows favorable physical properties for both modes, followed by numerical and analytical performance simulations. The ionic liquids 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate meet or exceed the storability properties of hydrazine, and their electrochemical properties indicate that they may be capable of electrospray emission in the purely ionic regime. These liquids are projected to have 13–23% reduced monopropellant propulsion performance in comparison to hydrazine due to the prediction of solid carbon formation in the exhaust. The use of these ionic liquids as a fuel component in a binary monopropellant mixture with hydroxylammonium nitrate shows a 1–4% improved specific impulse over some “green” monopropellants. Also, this avoids volatility issues and reduces the number of electrospray emitters by 18–27% and the power required by 9–16%, with oxidizing ionic liquid fuels providing the greatest savings. A fully oxygen-balanced ionic liquid will exceed the state-of-the-art performance in both modes but will require advances in hardware technology in both modes to achieve minimum functionality.",29,2

Recently developed kinetic models were used to simulate the experimental data for and flames. The computed results are in close agreement with the data for premixed flames, whereas the data are over-predicted for non-premixed flames. Furthermore, the extinction strain rates of premixed and flames are similar, while compared to , non-premixed flames exhibit greater extinction resistance. Regarding the practical fuels, the extinction propensity of flames of petroleum-derived fuels is higher compared to bio-derived fuels. The extinction strain rates of flames of 80% toluene mixtures were computed also to evaluate the effects of addition of aromatics on extinction. The results confirmed that the addition of toluene increases the extinction propensity compared to neat flames under both premixed and non-premixed conditions, which explains partially the experimental results for petroleum- and bio-derived practical fuels.",29,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34568,"The diffusion flame combustion behavior of several solid oxidizers (ammonium nitrate, phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, and ammonium dinitramide) in combination with a hydrocarbon fuel (ethylene) was examined. The oxidizers were first analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, and evolved gas analysis to gain an understanding of their basic decomposition characteristics. Next, an opposed flow burner was used to establish a diffusion flame between the decomposition products of the oxidizer(s) and the fuel. Regression rates of the solid oxidizer were measured by a linear variable displacement transducer as a function of fuel flow rate. Ammonium dinitramide demonstrated the highest linear regression rate characteristics by up to two orders of magnitude, followed by ammonium perchlorate, phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate, and finally ammonium nitrate. When comparing mass burning rates, ammonium perchlorate compares favorably to solid fuels such as hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. In addition, the flame zone(s) were imaged via high-speed photography to provide detailed information of flame characteristics. Flame imaging revealed large melt layers and boiling type behavior for ammonium nitrate and phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate as well as droplet ejection from the melt layer. The goal of this study was to gain an understanding of the fundamental combustion behavior of a diffusion flame between a solid oxidizer and a hydrocarbon fuel as a stepping-stone to more complex systems such as reverse hybrid rockets.",29,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34760,"Hybrid rocket combustion has important effects on rocket performance. The solid fuel regression rate is an important quantity in the hybrid rocket operation. In the past years, experimental and analytical investigations have been conducted to find correlations to correctly predict the regression rate. Numerical computations are becoming more important in the estimation of the characteristic parameters of such a complex combustion that embraces many different phenomena. This study predicts the regression rate of the Hydroxyl-Terminated Poly-Butadiene/Gaseous Oxygen formulation and its sensitivities to some operating parameters, such as combustion chamber pressure, oxygen inlet temperature, and mass flow rate. Furthermore, an analysis of other variables is used to explain the experimentally observed regression rate behavior. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of the oxygen between the flame and the surface, which is considered responsible for the pyrolysis process enhancement.",29,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34643,"Under contract of the European Space Agency, a 1 N bipropellant thruster system operating exclusively with green propellants was developed. One of the main properties to be investigated is the autoignition capability and conditions in a miniaturized combustion chamber. Hydrogen peroxide (87 wt%) and kerosene comprise the propellant combination of choice for this study. For the prediction of autoignition conditions, an analytic nonadiabatic autoignition model of the ignition conditions for a choked and nonchoked flow reactor has been developed. The model uses a single step forward chemical reaction and includes a residence time distribution of the propellants. A particular focus of the investigation is the probability of autoignition as a function of the pressure–temperature conditions and the combustion chamber geometry. For the validation of the autoignition model, a comprehensive test campaign was conducted. The autoignition conditions predicted by the model agree very well with the ones observed in the experiments. Additionally, the model identifies physical parameters that contribute to a previously empirical parameter. In conclusion, with the autoignition model, it is straightforward to design a propulsion system for a given inlet temperature, minimum desired ignition pressure, and blowdown ratio.",29,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34732,"Three-dimensional simulations of combustion instability can provide extremely valuable insight into the problem physics, but they represent an enormous investment in time and, thus, may preclude parametric studies that are practical with two-dimensional simulations. Three numerical simulations of an unstable laboratory rocket combustor were performed to assess the effect of grid resolution and dimensionality on the ability to predict and model combustion instability. Computations show that two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations using both coarse and fine grids are able to capture the amplitude of the first longitudinal mode within an order of magnitude of what was measured in the experiment. Whereas the three-dimensional calculation based on the coarse grid resolution shows excellent agreement with the experimental level of instability two-dimensional simulations are valuable in parametric evaluations in developing diagnostic methods and in increasing the efficiency of expensive three-dimensional simulations.",29,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34707,"Cavitation in cryogenic rocket propellants was simulated using a surrogate fluid exhibiting thermodynamic properties similar to liquid hydrogen. A NACA 0015 hydrofoil was chosen to represent the leading edge of a turbopump inducer, and it was installed in a closed-loop facility filled with a fluid that exhibits a strong thermodynamic effect at ambient conditions. Static pressures were measured at seven locations along the hydrofoil chord and along the wall of the test section. Flow at Reynolds numbers up to and temperature high enough to produce above unity exploited the thermosensitive properties of the surrogate fluid. Sensitivity to isolated effects of velocity, cavitation number, temperature, and angle of attack were studied, and behavior of the cavity growth and collapse cycle is described. Cavitation was observed at local static pressure both above and below the vapor point corresponding to the inlet temperature. Pressure and frequency analysis of these phenomena is described.",29,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34687,"Wind-tunnel tests were performed to determine the effect of vitiation on flameholding limits in a hydrocarbon-fueled dual-mode scramjet flameholder. The test air was generated both clean and with 6.7% water by mole to examine the effect of hydrogen combustion vitiation on flameholding. The tests were performed in a direct-connect configuration with a Mach 2 inlet, a constant area isolator, a directly fueled cavity flameholder, and a rectangular divergent combustor. Ethylene was chosen as the test fuel. An air throttle was used as an independent backpressure source to hold the position of the shock train constant, minimizing the variation of the flowfield upstream of the cavity so that the sensitivity of flameholding to chemical kinetics could be better isolated. Both the test medium total temperature and fuel equivalence ratio, in separate tests, were lowered until blowout to determine the lower limits of flight Mach number and lean fuel operation, respectively. The measurements showed no distinguishable difference between the clean-air and vitiated tests. This indicates that, when evaluating combustion heated wind-tunnel data on flameholding limits in directly fueled cavity flameholders, it is unnecessary to compensate for vitiation effects when combustor pressure is held constant.",29,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34594,"The design space of an intercooled recuperated aero-engine has been explored using detailed engine and aircraft performance, weight, and dimensions modeling. The design parameters of the engine fan, core, intercooler, recuperator, cooling-air ratio, and variable-geometry settings for the low-pressure turbine have been optimized for minimum mission fuel. Analysis shows that the improvement achieved in terms of performance against the datum design can be attributed primarily to an increase in thermal efficiency. A parametric study has also been carried out around the optimal design to understand the impact of the chosen design parameters on mission fuel burn. The study demonstrates in detail the substantially more complex interrelationship that the different fan design parameters have in terms of engine performance compared to what is typical for conventional turbofan designs. Furthermore, the optimal pressure ratio split between the low-pressure compressor and the high-pressure compressor aligns well with a previous analytical study. It is also revealed that the increased amount of cooling air required when a hot bleeding concept is adopted is in fact beneficial for mission fuel burn. Finally, the study concludes that the potential of using variable geometry in the low-pressure turbine for improving fuel burn is limited by the high-pressure turbine blade-metal temperature.",29,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34496,"An improved method has been developed to compute the thrust of a dual-mode scramjet, which is an engine with a combustor that operates both subsonically and supersonically. This strategy applies to any internal flow that can be modeled one-dimensionally. To handle the mathematical singularity at the location of thermal choking, the simple Shapiro method is expanded to create a new method that includes finite-rate chemistry and high-temperature gas properties. A forward shooting method is employed to find appropriate initial conditions for integration of the governing equations, which results in a unique transonic (choked) condition capable of reaching a supersonic state at the end of the domain. Solutions of the governing equations are computed using the propulsion code MASIV, which has been integrated into a hypersonic vehicle flight dynamics code. Computations for both ram-mode and scram-mode operations are compared to experimental results. Predictions are made for flight conditions of a hypersonic vehicle built around the given flowpath. Benefits of a pseudo-one-dimensional approach are that computational time is small and physical reasons for observed engine performance are easy to determine. Limitations include the fact that behavior of oblique shocks and other two-dimensional and three-dimensional phenomena in the combustor cannot be computed directly.",29,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34576,"This study uses a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes finite volume flow solver to simulate the flowfields around a two-dimensional linear turbine cascade model at a Reynolds number of 25,000. Three blade profiles have been simulated, including the aft-loaded Pack B, which has a nominal Zweifel loading coefficient equal to 1.15, the midloaded L1M , and the front-loaded L2F . All three blade profiles are known to be susceptible to varying degrees of laminar flow separation along the suction surface. Turbulence models used, which to the authors’ knowledge have been applied for the first time here, are the Abe–Kondoh–Nagano linear low- as well as the Kato–Launder modification. Time-accurate simulations, including fully laminar computations, are compared with experimental data and higher-order computations to judge the accuracy of the results, where it is shown that Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations with appropriate turbulence modeling can produce both quantitatively and qualitatively similar separation behavior as seen in experiments. However, large-scale vortical motions predicted by the turbulence models and laminar solver advect downstream and instigate flow reattachment, a result the authors believe would be attenuated to some degree by three-dimensional vortex breakdown. Results collectively show that characterization of transition to turbulence as judged by analysis of the Reynolds shear stress is not sufficient in two dimensions, and further analysis including spectral methods may be necessary to better predict transition at low Reynolds number.",29,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34613,"This paper describes a computational fluid dynamics method enabling unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes computations of compressor configurations including nonaxisymmetric casing treatments. The interaction between the casing treatment and the rotor is simulated thanks to an overset grid approach, in which the meshes of the rotor blade channel and of the slot are independent. The method uses a phase-lag-type approach, which enables reduction of the computational domain to one single slot and one rotor blade channel. The present method is evaluated on an experimental configuration of casing treatments at two rotating speeds.",29,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34650,"The area of application of the Hall effect thrusters is constantly expanding, both in the direction of reduced power and toward an increase of power and specific impulse. The two main problems are studied in this paper. The first is to examine the possibility of providing the similarity of plasma parameters in Hall effect thrusters, and the second is to estimate the best achievable output characteristics when scaling Hall effect thrusters. It is shown that a strict similarity of plasma parameters is possible only for the same type of propellant at the same discharge voltage at invariance of at least two dimensionless scaling parameters. Based on the analysis of the similarity criteria and available experimental data, a speculative assertion is made, that in the optimal mode, all the geometrical dimensions of the Hall thruster should be changed in the same proportion. For this type of scaling, the semi-empirical expression for the mass utilization efficiency is obtained under the invariance of the heat flux on the discharge-channel walls. This expression is used to investigate the regularities of performance changes in the optimal mode by varying the discharge power and discharge voltage, and using different types of propellants.",29,2
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B34628,"The parameters of a thermionic heaterless hollow cathode operating in the diode mode were determined using various diagnostic methods, and studied in relation to the discharge current, in the range 0.5–1.5 A, the orifice plate–anode gap, and the xenon-gas flow rate. It was shown that the cathode ignition consists of breakdown, heating, and keeping phases, and it realizes in the timescale of a few seconds depending on the xenon-gas flow rate. Dependencies of the cathode and orifice potential vs the gas flow rate and discharge current were obtained. The plasma plume parameters (plasma density and temperature) were studied using double Langmuir probe and spatial resolved optical spectroscopy. The energy distribution of the generated electron beam was obtained by the retarding energy analyzer and biased collimated Faraday cup. The processes involved in the hollow cathode ignition, heating, and dc operation are discussed, and the influence of initial conditions on the reliability and efficiency of the operation of a hollow cathode is determined. Finally, a simple model for estimation of the emitter temperature during the cathode operation is suggested.",29,2
