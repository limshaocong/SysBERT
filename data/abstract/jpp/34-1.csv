2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36372,"Recent experiments reveal that even simple thermoacoustic systems may exhibit nonlinear behavior, far more elaborate than period-1 limit cycle oscillations. Consequently, a new approach based on nonlinear dynamics is emerging besides conventional linear analysis to characterize unstable regimes in gas turbine combustors. This approach reduces or avoids the risk of misunderstanding the deterministic chaos, hidden in the measured signals also during stable combustion regimes, as stochastic noise. The gained information will be available to analytically formulate an index acting as the earliest warning signal of an impending oscillatory combustion instability. In light of this, we first apply the chaotic analisys to an unsteady thermoacoustic time series coming from a typical industrial combustor operated in a stability-to-humming/back-to-stability transition. Then, observing that the Rayleigh and extended Chu indices describe the instability as a linear-interaction-induced synchronization between heat release and flow disturbances, to account for nonlinear interactions, the chaotic synchronization theory is applied. In particular, the interdependence index , a nonlinear causality detector, with no previous applications in combustion instability sensing, is proven to be more effective than linear analysis detectors, both in the early perception of self-sustained (chaotic or not) thermoacoustic oscillations and in gaining meaningful insight on unsteady combustor physics.",34,1

Advances in aerodynamic modeling have permitted the design of highly loaded low-pressure turbine blades with good midspan loss performance. Earlier research has shown that forward loading can mitigate the low-Reynolds-number performance lapse at midspan but also results in increased secondary losses. Experiments and simulations were carried out to characterize the flow through a highly loaded linear cascade with front-loaded profiles at a Reynolds number based on axial chord and inflow velocity of 100,000. Endwall and suction surface oil-flow visualizations were obtained and particle image velocimetry measurements were taken in several axial planes inside and downstream of the cascade. Good agreement of the experimental and numerical data was achieved with respect to the trajectory of the passage vortex and the suction-side corner flow as well as the total pressure loss coefficient. A detailed analysis of the simulation data revealed a pronounced suction-side corner separation that can be characterized by streamwise vortices that have the same sense of rotation as the passage vortex.",34,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36437,"A fundamental study of radio-frequency preionization has been conducted as a preliminary step toward the application in a seed-free magnetohydrodynamic electrical power generator. Argon gas heated and pressured in a shock tunnel facility is accelerated to supersonic speeds in a straight cylindrical duct without applied magnetic field and is ionized by a radio-frequency electromagnetic field with an induction coil. The experimental results show that the discharge changes from E-mode to H-mode via unstable discharge with the increase in radio-frequency input power. This H-mode discharge generates a stable plasma in the supersonic flow. Two-dimensional numerical simulations show that the calculated static pressure and coil current agree with the experimental results. In the supersonic flow, the maximum Joule heating and ionization occur close to the duct wall because of the effect of the velocity boundary layer, and the plasma is almost attached to the wall. Conversely, in the subsonic flow, maximum Joule heating and ionization occur away from the duct wall. The power factor of discharge in the supersonic flow is higher than that of the discharge in the subsonic flow under the same input power conditions.",34,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36307,"The aim of this research is to present a preliminary experimental investigation on the behavior of lithium–aluminum complex hydrides when exposed to gaseous nitrogen in the range of 20–350°C for airbreathing propulsion applications. This specific task is part of the long-term project devoted to the use of lithium–aluminum hydrides in airbreathing propulsion applications. It is known that a launch system based on the airbreathing technology, by using air as oxidizer, reduces the cost per kilogram of the launch; it is therefore much more profitable than common rocket engines (solid and liquid rockets). The effect of nitrogen gas on the thermal behavior and the kinetic parameters of lithium–aluminum hydride and trilithium–aluminum hydride has been investigated. Differential scanning calorimeter tests, performed using nitrogen gas, have shown the presence of a strong exothermic peak that, when using helium or argon gas, is barely noticeable. A nitridation reaction has been suggested to explain the increase of the sample mass after each differential scanning calorimeter test, which supports the experimental data. The activation energy and frequency factor for the samples of lithium–aluminum hydride and trilithium–aluminum hydride have been calculated using two simplified kinetic methods: the Ozawa method and the Kissinger method.",34,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36404,"To enable comparison of thruster performance across different vacuum facilities, an understanding of the effect of operating pressure on plasma plume properties generated in a helicon ion thruster architecture is required. Plasma property measurements acquired at two different vacuum facility operating pressures are used to determine the effect of neutral ingestion on the operation of a replica of the Madison Helicon Experiment at low power. The ion velocity distribution function, electron temperature, ion number density, and plasma potential are measured along the thruster axis. Plasma plume property measurements made at the “high-pressure condition” ( corrected for argon) are compared to values recorded at the “low-pressure condition” ( corrected for argon) for thruster operation at radio-frequency forward power, 340 G source region magnetic field strength, and argon volumetric flow rate. Operation at the high-pressure condition has 31–79 V lower ion energy, 0.8–6.1 eV lower electron temperature, and higher ion number densities than operation at the low-pressure condition. Changes in collision frequency and ionization balance result from increased neutral ingestion at the higher operating pressure.",34,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36468,"Nuclear thermal propulsion is an enabling technology for delivering large payloads to Mars, and ground testing of a nuclear thermal engine is an important part of the development. A critical issue in nuclear thermal engine ground testing is the presence of a large amount of hot hydrogen exhausted during the tests, which needs to be totally contained. A hydrogen containment process is proposed in this study in which an oxygen-rich burner and a tubular heat exchanger are employed for hydrogen containment. The objective of this effort is therefore to demonstrate that this new process could achieve the goal of total hydrogen containment for nuclear thermal engine ground testing. A multidimensional pressure-based multiphase computational fluid dynamics methodology was used to conceptually size the oxygen-rich burner, whereas a one-dimensional thermal analysis methodology was used to conceptually size the heat exchanger. Subsequently, a steady-state operation of the entire hydrogen containment process (from the pressure vessel through the nozzle, diffuser, burner, and heat exchanger) was simulated numerically, with the aforementioned computational fluid dynamics methodology. The computed results show that the exhaust hydrogen is reduced to meet the design goal at the end of the heat exchanger, demonstrating the hydrogen containment capability of the proposed process.",34,1

Accelerated thermal aging was carried out in air at 60°C for 3, 6, and 9 months, equivalent to natural aging at 23°C for 4, 8 and 12.5 years, respectively. For fracture tests, the in situ video imaging and the electrical resistance techniques were used for crack length measurements and the blunting line determination. The energy release rate and the integral at crack growth initiation were identical for all the cases, evidence of an elastic nonlinear behavior. The source of the nonlinearity was caused by blunting, voiding, coalescing, and growing. The failure process zone extended . The thermal oxidative aging process did not produce relevant changes in either the mechanical behavior or the fracture characterization, probably because the material under study was already naturally degraded. The influence was mainly observed in the slope of the blunting line determined experimentally for the long-term aged samples, which was between twice and three times higher than the unaged and short-term aged specimens. The microstructural evolution during the fracture test showed that the intergranular fracture caused by nonadherent particles was more evident with aging time.",34,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36435,"A direct-current electric field was investigated as a damping method for thermoacoustic instabilities generated in a horizontal Rijke tube driven by a premixed propane torch. Electrode lengths of 2.54, 5.08, and 15.24 cm were used with electrode locations relative to the burner tip of , , and 0.458 cm and voltages up to 4.68 kV being tested. Electrodes downstream of the burner tip, rather than surrounding the burner, and longer electrodes were most effective at damping instabilities. Damping also increased with applied voltage. These findings held true for both laminar and turbulent flames and were in agreement with theoretical predictions made based on two-dimensional static electric field models. Sound pressure level reductions up to 21 dB for the laminar flame, which completely damped the instability, and 4.4 dB for the turbulent flame were seen using the 15.24 cm electrode at 4.68 kV. When the entire Rijke tube acted as the electrode, a reduction of 19 dB was seen for the turbulent flame at 9 kV, which suppressed the instability. The damping effect was attributed to stabilization of the oscillating flame and its unsteady heat release, driven by the combustion instability pressure fluctuations, via the ionic wind.",34,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36456,"The influence of selected single-component hydrocarbons on lean blowout behavior of swirl-stabilized spray flames was investigated. Additional information on the spray characteristics was collected by phase Doppler interferometry and Mie scattering measurements. The measurements were accomplished in a gas-turbine model combustor under atmospheric pressure and at two different air preheat temperatures. The combustor featured a dual-swirl geometry and a prefilming airblast atomizer. The combustion chamber provided good optical access and yielded well-defined boundary conditions. Three single-component hydrocarbons were chosen: one short and one long linear alkane (-hexane and -dodecane) as well as one branched alkane (iso-octane). Kerosene Jet A-1 was used as a reference. Results show noticeable differences in the lean blowout limits of the various fuels, at comparable flow conditions. By using the results of the measurements, of additional modeling, and of an assessment of the fuel properties, it was concluded that fuel differences in lean blowout in this combustor can be due to differences in the physical properties as well as in the chemical properties.",34,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36556,"This study aims at proving the existence of the optimal number of high initial sample for time-efficient optimization and demonstrating that the reliable optimization results can be guaranteed when the hierarchical kriging model is used as a surrogate model. The hierarchical kriging model is one sort of variable-fidelity modeling, which mimics the general tendency of a model based on the low-fidelity information and calibrates the accuracy of the model with the high-fidelity information. There, however, have been still several ambiguities to be clarified for practical utilization of hierarchical kriging model. For clarifying these, the film-cooling hole arrangement is selected as an optimization target. The optimization is progressed with the expected-improvement-based efficient global optimization algorithm coupled with the hierarchical kriging model. The fidelity in this paper is classified by mesh density: 2 million and 8 million grid system. According to this overall optimization process, case studies are conducted with respect to the number of high initial samples. As a result, the reliable optimization results are obtained regardless of different numbers of high initial samples, and approximately 40% time reduction can be obtained.",34,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36401,"A pulse-detonation thruster can generate a high-repeatability small impulse at a high operating frequency. To operate a pulse-detonation cycle in a vacuum environment without a purging material, a liquid-purge method proposed by Matsuoka et al. (“Development of a Liquid-Purge Method for High-Frequency Operation of Pulse Detonation Combustor,” Combustion Science and Technology, Vol. 187, No. 5, 2015, pp. 747–764) and throat at the exit of the combustor were introduced. In the demonstration experiment, gaseous ethylene–liquid nitrous oxide, as detonable mixture, and a throat having an inner diameter of 3.6 mm (blockage ) were used. The measured cyclic flame-propagation speeds were and of the estimated Chapman–Jouguet detonation speed. Consequently, a 50 Hz pulse-detonation operation without a purging material in the ambient-pressure range of 0.035–1.5 kPa was confirmed. A quasi-steady model, in which gases in the combustor are in the stationary state, was newly developed to investigate the operating characteristic of the pulse-detonation thruster. The experimental pressure history in the combustor during the burned-gas blowdown process was in good agreement with that of the model. Moreover, using the model, the thrust performance of the pulse-detonation thruster with a converging–diverging nozzle was investigated. It was found that the estimated specific impulse was comparable with that of the theoretical steady-state rocket engine.",34,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36441,"The hypergolic ignition behaviors of four newly synthesized ionic liquids with dicyanamide anion (ionic liquids 1 and 3) and cyanoborohydride anion (ionic liquids 2 and 4) were experimentally investigated. The results showed that successful hypergolic ignition of both group ionic liquids were achieved with white fuming nitric acid and red fuming nitric acid. Two distinct flame initiation processes illustrated by several stages were observed for each group of ionic liquids. Specifically, the ionic liquid 1 drop showed immerging, exploding, and ignition: the drop immerged and reacted with the oxidizers underneath the liquid surface, producing gas vapor and white foam like intermediates on the surface; then, the surface exploded by fast accumulation of heat and vapor underneath, followed by flame kernels formation in the adjacent gas phase. The ionic liquid 2 drop showed bouncing and igniting: it just created a crater on the oxidizer surface and then sat on the Leidenfrost vapor layer generated by impaction and reaction. Ionic liquids 3 and 4 showed a similar flame initiation process, respectively, to that of ionic liquids 1 and 2. Furthermore, the explosion delay time and ignition delay time of the four ionic liquids were recorded, both the previous and present experimental repeatabilities were analyzed, and it was shown that heat loss control was important to the experimental repeatability.",34,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36517,"A novel internal ballistics technique for determining the time-resolved spatially averaged regression rate of the solid-fuel grain in a hybrid rocket engine is presented. This technique makes use of the measurements of the oxidizer mass flow rate and the pressure levels in both the motor prechamber and postchamber, and it allows estimation of the combustion efficiency evolution over the burning time as well. A one-dimensional steady-state model, which takes into account the variation of the gas mixture thermodynamic properties along the fuel grain port, is adopted to predict thermofluid-dynamic parameters across the combustion chamber as a function of the regression rate and pressure. Two experimental test cases, both realized on a laboratory-scale rocket (one of which shows the typical features of the axial-injection motor burning oxygen with pure fuel, and the other the different behavior ensuing from a radial injection and fuel loaded with aluminum particles), are successfully analyzed, revealing the capability of this technique to reconstruct the fundamental aspects of the internal ballistics in substantially different conditions.",34,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36181,"The stall margin and pressure ratio of an axial compressor can both be increased with the use of circumferential groove casing treatments over the rotor. Performance and stall point measurements were obtained in a single-stage high-speed axial compressor with seven different casing treatment configurations. The different configurations were designed to investigate the effects of the number and placement of circumferential grooves. The results demonstrated that the stall margin extension caused by individual grooves could be added together to obtain the value obtained with the equivalent multigroove configuration. Furthermore, the relationship between stall margin extension and the tip-clearance momentum flux was considered. A Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational solution from the smooth-wall configuration was used to obtain the momentum flux of the reverse flow at the tip. The results showed a linear relationship between the measured stall extension and the computed smooth-wall momentum flux integrated over the region occupied by the grooves.",34,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36528,"A new skeletal mechanism, consisting of 16 species and 72 reactions, has been developed for lean methane–air premixed combustion from the GRI-Mech 3.0. The skeletal mechanism is validated for elevated unburnt temperatures (800 K) and pressures up to 4 atm, thereby addressing realistic gas turbine conditions. The skeletal mechanism is obtained by applying the directed relation graph method and performing sensitivity analysis on the detailed mechanism. The mechanism has been validated for flame speed and flame structure in a wide range of conditions and configurations. A good agreement between the skeletal mechanism and GRI-3.0 was obtained. The configurations considered include one-dimension laminar premixed flames, laminar non-premixed counterflow burners, and two- and three-dimensional unsteady configurations with variations of temperature, pressure, and composition. The skeletal mechanism allows for the inclusion of accurate finite rate chemistry in large-scale direct numerical simulations of lean turbulent premixed flames. In a large-scale direct numerical simulation, the use of the skeletal mechanism reduces the memory requirements by more than a factor of 3 and accelerates the simulation by a factor of 7 compared with the detailed mechanism. The skeletal mechanism is suitable for unsteady three-dimensional simulations of methane turbulent premixed, non-premixed, and globally lean partially premixed flames and is available as supplementary material.",34,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36533,"This paper presents numerical and experimental investigations of the two-phase underwater ramjet. Unlike giving a fixed initial bubble radius in previous studies, the more advanced numerical model, which can calculate the initial bubble radius on the basis of the flowfield parameters, was developed by considering the process of bubble formation. A scaled-down experimental ramjet engine was tested in a direct-connect ground testing system to characterize the factors influencing the engine performance. The results show that, with the gas/water ratio rising up, the dimensionless thrust was almost linearly increased, and a bubble injector with a smaller orifice diameter was only able to promote the engine performance slightly. The predictions with the present model compare very favorably with experimental results, and the net thrust of the two-phase underwater ramjet can be predicted with an accuracy of less than .",34,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36458,"Experimental counterflow and impinging jet studies and modeling analysis of hypergolic hydrogen peroxide and gel hydrocarbon fuel/particle mixtures were conducted to characterize condensed phase reaction rates and ignition delay times. The mixtures consisted of -dodecane, -heptane, and kerosene containing fumed silica and sodium borohydride particles. Scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analysis of the particles were performed to characterize particle size, size distribution, geometry, surface composition, and thermal decomposition. Liquid-phase counterflow experiments were used to derive a global rate constant for the condensed phase reaction between and . Chemical kinetics calculations were performed using the condensed phase global reaction coupled with a detailed gas phase mechanism for hydrocarbon oxidation to phenomenologically study the ignition process. Shorter ignition delays were achieved when fuel flow was established before oxidizer injection. Ignition delay decreased with addition until a limiting loading was achieved, after which ignition delay remained nearly constant. Elevating the reactant temperature reduced ignition delay, consistent with fuel volatility trends. Modeling results show that the ignition process relies upon the reaction between and to gasify and heat an ignition kernel to the mixture autoignition temperature.",34,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36571,"Impinging jet experiments were conducted using doublet, triplet, and quintuplet injector configurations to measure ignition delay of hydrogen peroxide with gel hydrocarbon fuel containing sodium borohydride particles. Rheological characterization and surface tension measurements of gel fuel mixtures were obtained to demonstrate their non-Newtonian shear thinning behavior and determine the influence of addition. Cold-flow experiments were conducted to elucidate system startup transients. First light times decreased with increasing reactant flow velocity, whereas ignition delay decreased until a plateau was achieved beyond . Variation of reactant flow and global equivalence ratios exhibited a relative independence of such conditions on ignition delay. Doublet and triplet injector configurations produced comparable first light and ignition onset times, whereas the average ignition time for the quintuplet injector configuration was nearly doubled. Transition of flow conditions (from fans to a more conical flow structure) downstream of impingement may have detrimentally influenced ignition for the quintuplet configuration by affecting the overall reactive surface area and volume in which the reactants are distributed. These results indicate that more complex multi-injector geometries are not necessary to achieve short ignition delay times for this system, and reactant flows may be varied to optimize for performance without adversely affecting ignition delay.",34,1

(“Limiting Contractions for Starting Simple Ramp-Type Scramjet Intakes with Overboard Spillage,” Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 24, No. 5, 2008, pp. 1042–1049) is applied in the present paper to Prandtl–Meyer scramjet intakes. Starting characteristics for Prandtl–Meyer intakes of various particular designs are also obtained. It is shown that the strong shock design principle proposed by Veillard et al. for simple ramp-type intakes holds for Prandtl–Meyer intakes as well, that is, the intake design based on the assumption of a strong shock terminating at the trailing edge of the intake’s ramp would lead to the Kantrowitz (self-starting) line, which is very close to the theoretically established limiting values for this intake family. The theoretical findings on startability of Prandtl–Meyer intakes are confirmed by the numerical intake-starting experiments based on the same flow model as the one used in the theory (inviscid non-heat-conducting ideal gas with constant specific heats).",34,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36428,"In modern aeroengines, combustion noise has become a significant source to the overall noise, particularly at approach conditions. This requires further advances in understanding and predicting combustion noise of turbulent flames. This is the aim of the present study, where a hybrid computational fluid dynamics/computational aeroacoustics approach is applied on a generic premixed and pressurized combustor to assess its accuracy for combustion noise predictions. The hybrid approach consists of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulations (LES) mean flow and frequency-domain simulations based on linearized Navier–Stokes equations that are fed by combustion noise source terms. The latter are obtained from both the application of a statistical noise model on the RANS simulations and a postprocessing of incompressible LES, in a first step. The acoustic simulation results are compared with experimental pressure measurements conducted by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. Very good agreement is found over the entire frequency range if the LES source model is applied. Sensitivity studies with respect to feeding lines, mean flowfield, and mesh were performed. The resulting comparisons of the linearized Navier–Stokes equation simulations based on the RANS and LES flowfields revealed that the combustion noise spectrum is mainly governed by the heat release spectrum but not by the aerodynamic combustor flowfield. However, this issue needs further investigation.",34,1

Depending on the work function of the coating and the tether temperature , the photoelectron emission can be relevant within the cathodic tether segment. Thus, this mechanism needs to be added to the thermionic emission considered in previous works. An emission model for low-work-function tethers, including a typical solar photon spectrum, a Fowler–DuBridge law for the photoelectron yield of the coating, and a Richardson–Dushman law for the thermionic emission, is presented, and used to organize the thermionic and photoelectric dominated regimes of low-work-function tethers within the plane. For and , the photoemission and thermionic emission can be of the same order and have similar efficiency as the electron collection. The emission model is combined with orbital-motion theory for all the plasma and emitted particles, and the longitudinal bias and current profiles throughout a low-work-function tether are determined for typical low-Earth-orbit environmental values. Results for the average current are presented. The study highlights the main electrical, mechanical, and optical properties that should be considered in the design of low-work-function tethers, and it briefly discusses some promising materials.",34,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36611,"A numerical study is conducted to investigate the impact of different chemical reaction mechanisms on the behavior of reactive nozzle flow. Therefore, a 66-step chemical reaction mechanism for oxygen/methane combustion is implemented into German Aerospace Center’s flow solver TAU. Ignition delay simulations are conducted and compared to experimental data to demonstrate the validity of this implementation. The implemented 66-step baseline chemistry model is applied for generic nozzle flow simulations, and the results are compared to frozen nozzle flow and nozzle flow in chemical equilibrium in order to investigate the impact of the finite-rate approach. The 66-step baseline reaction mechanism is reduced to a seven-step basic configuration, which is applied to the generic nozzle flow. A good agreement of the 66-step and the seven-step model is observed. Both approaches are applied for Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations of a dual-bell nozzle hot-gas flow. Almost no deviation between the 66-step baseline model and the reduced chemical seven-step approach is observed. The dual-bell transition behavior at different values of combustion chamber mixture ratio is investigated, applying Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations with a reduced chemistry model. Validation data for the simulations are obtained during a hot-flow test campaign. The experimentally observed impact of the combustion chamber mixture ratio on the dual-bell transition nozzle pressure ratio is clearly reproduced by the numerical approach. A good agreement with the experimentally obtained, transition nozzle pressure ratio values is reached by the numerical simulations.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36014,"The optimization and knowledge discovery of a low-aspect-ratio cascade was conducted. The techniques of nonaxisymmetric endwall contouring, section profiling, and compound lean were combined for cascade parameterization. Their effects on cascade performance were investigated through analysis of flow details and well-designed scatter plot. It is found that nonaxisymmetric endwall contouring is helpful to reduce the profile loss while also inhibiting the secondary flow. Section profiling is an effective technique to reduce the profile loss. And the lean structure is responsible for the multimodality of the loss function because it makes the reduction of profile loss and endwall loss in severe conflicting relation. The combination of the techniques is shown to effectively improve the cascade performance. In addition, through the analysis of self-organizing map and Pearson’s correlation, the mass flow rate and outlet flow angle are found to be linearly correlated, whereas the relation between the loss and mass flow rate is complex. Finally, because the optimal solution is sensitive to the objective function as shown by the two optimization processes, the data mining of interactions among performance functions and design variables becomes very important, which can help to achieve the desirable design performance in the prescribed design space.",34,1

The axial-injection end-burning type fuel grains were made by high-accuracy three-dimensional printing. Firing tests were conducted using gaseous oxygen as the oxidizer at a chamber pressure range of 0.10 to 0.43 MPa. Results of 15 static firings tests show that fuel regression rate increases as the chamber pressure rises, and fuel regression rate decreases as the oxidizer port velocity increases. A data reduction method was developed to avoid the difficulty in calculating oxidizer-to-fuel ratio. A simplified fuel regression model based on the granular diffusion flame model is developed to investigate regression characteristics. The trend in results as calculated using the granular diffusion flame model agrees with that in experimentally observe values. However, this does not hold true in tests with varying oxidizer port velocity. A granular diffusion flame model only takes into account simple solid propellant regression. Therefore, modification of the model is needed for calculating the fuel regression rate of an end-burning hybrid rocket.",34,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B36376,"Experiments to explore the effect of the molecular structure of ionic liquid propellants on the emission mode from a colloid thruster are reported. The colloid thruster is an electrospray device that has application in small thrust space missions. These thrusters can be operated at or between two limiting modes, that of droplets or ions. The droplet mode generally produces higher thrust, whereas the ion mode higher specific impulse. A design challenge is to select a propellant that operates best in a desired mode or that has the capability of operating throughout the range from droplets to ions thus offering large turndown ratios. Eight ionic liquids were selected for electrospray experiments: 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium dicyanamide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium tricyanomethide, 1-ethyl-2-methylpyrazolium tetrafluoroborate, allylmethylimidazolium dicyanamide, and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide. The electrospray results reveal propellants that operate best in which mode, whether droplet, mixed, or ionic emission regimes.
