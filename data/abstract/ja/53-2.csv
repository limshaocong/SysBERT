The reconfiguration capability of an unmanned-aerial-vehicle family for different aerial tasks offers a clear cost advantage to end users over acquiring separate unmanned aerial vehicles dedicated to specific types of missions. At the same time, it allows the manufacturer the opportunity to capture distinct market segments, while saving on overhead costs, transportation costs, and after-market services. Such macroscale reconfigurability can be introduced through effective application of modular product-platform-planning concepts. This paper advances and implements the Comprehensive Product Platform Planning framework to design a family of three reconfigurable twin-boom unmanned aerial vehicles with different mission requirements. The original Comprehensive Product Platform Planning method was suitable for scale-based product-family design. In this paper, important modifications to the commonality matrix and the commonality constraint formulation in Comprehensive Product Platform Planning are performed. These advancements enable the Comprehensive Product Platform Planning to design an optimum set of distinct unmanned-aerial-vehicle modules, different groups of which could be assembled to configure twin-boom unmanned aerial vehicles that provide three different combinations of payload capacity and endurance. The six key modules that participate in the platform planning are 1) the fuselage/pod, 2) the wing, 3) the booms, 4) the vertical tails, 5) the horizontal tail, and 6) the fuel tank. The performance of each unmanned aerial vehicle is defined in terms of its range per unit fuel consumption (miles/gallon). It is found that, when the average unmanned-aerial-vehicle performance (miles/gallon) and the commonality among the unmanned-aerial-vehicle variants are simultaneously maximized, a one-third reduction in the number of unique modules is accomplished at a 66% compromise in performance. On the other hand, when simultaneously maximizing performance and minimizing costs, the best tradeoff unmanned-aerial-vehicle-family designs provide a remarkable 26% reduction in cost for a 6% compromise in performance. In this case, the cost savings are attributed to both material reduction and increased module sharing across the three unmanned-aerial-vehicle variants. It is also observed that, among the best tradeoff unmanned-aerial-vehicle families, the individual unmanned aerial vehicles are most likely to share the horizontal tail and tail booms, and are least likely to share the wing.",53,2

Four of the airframes were used as single-engine air tankers, whereas the fifth was flown exclusively for agricultural applications. The data collectively consisted of 454 h of flight time from firefighting and 100 h from the agricultural operation. Gust and maneuver vertical load factors are separated using the two-second rule, and their cumulative occurrences are presented per 1000 h. The flight load spectra are presented for the overall flight and for individual phases. Gust loads are shown to behave similarly for all missions. Air tankers are shown to be subject to a large load factor during the drop phase, which occurs once or twice per flight. In the case of agricultural missions, the positive load factors do not reach very high values but occur at much larger frequencies. It is also shown that the load factor alone is not a sufficient indicator of the stresses exerted on the structure due to the large changes in the aircraft weight.",53,2

The trailing-edge flap is added to the UH-60A’s rotor, with the flap’s span, deflection angles, and start/end deployment azimuth positions all optimized to minimize the total rotor power and the resulting hub vibratory loads. The formal optimization effort is carried out through the coupling of a comprehensive analysis code and one of two evolutionary algorithm-based optimizers. With regard to a single-segment flap, peak power savings over the flight envelope reached 9.5% (at an advance ratio of 0.30) with associated out-of-plane and in-plane hub vibration reductions of 66 and 22%, respectively. The dual-segment trailing-edge flap optimization with a span limitation yielded power savings of 8.9% at the same flight condition. Multi-objective optimizations were performed at a target flight condition with an advance ratio of 0.3 for a total of four objectives: minimizing rotor power and all three hub vibratory loads. One optimum solution found 6.7% power savings, 68% out-of-plane hub vibration reductions, and 53% in-plane hub vibration reductions.",53,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033481,"Efficient design of modern aircraft requires an understanding of the mechanical behavior of carbon fiber panels under both in-plane and out-of-plane loading conditions. Currently, relatively little published literature exists for out-of-plane shear (mode III) loading. This paper presents both experimental and computational results for strain fields showing damage initiation, and propagation of notched carbon fiber panels under mode III loading. Experimentally, strain fields were measured using digital image correlation. Computationally, the commercial finite element package Abaqus, using typical composite analysis techniques, was used to calculate strain fields. Comparisons were made between measured and calculated values. Experimental results indicated that areas of both tensile and compressive strain concentrations existed at the notch tip. Damage initiation occurred in these areas, typically only in one or the other. Subsequent damage propagation occurred both in areas of elevated tensile strain and in areas of elevated compressive strain. Computational results showed differences of typically to as compared with experimental results for notch tip strain concentrations before damage and with larger differences after damage had occurred. Overall, these results provide information on how notched carbon fiber panels behave under mode III loading and the effectiveness of a commonly used computational approach in predicating this behavior.",53,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033469,"To improve the efficiency of wing structural optimization in the aircraft preliminary design, an equivalent finite element model and a three-step optimization strategy were developed, taking the displacement, stiffness, buckling, and flutter requirements into account. The finite element model of a wing is reduced by the equivalent-strength-and-stiffness method instead of modeling the stiffener. It is beneficial to parameterize the modeling process for the wing primary structure. The composite wing of a regional aircraft is used to verify the equivalent finite element model with the static, buckling, and flutter analyses. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated through the comparison with the detailed finite element model. Then, the three-step optimization strategy was performed for the same case. The results show that the optimization strategy for the composite-wing design is efficient, and the equivalent finite element model in conjunction with the rapid modeling is suitable for the preliminary structural optimization with the static and dynamic constraints.",53,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033346,"Aerodynamic heating on structural surfaces plays an important role in the aeroelastic stability of flight vehicles, particularly in a high-temperature environment. The thermal effects of high-speed flow, obtained from a heat-conduction analysis, at the end of an unsteady time step are incorporated in the model solution, which in turn affects the unsteady flow arising out of interaction of the elastic structure with the air. This paper describes the development, implementation, and application of a highly integrated computational-fluid-dynamics-based aerothermoelastic analysis capability and the resulting code. The associated methodology employs the common finite element discretization for both fluid and structure disciplines using unstructured grids. An aeroelastic matrix formulation that uses a transpiration technique in lieu of aerodynamics mesh updating affects an efficient and accurate simulation of the aerothermoelastic phenomenon. The first example problem of a cantilever wing demonstrates the possible severity of thermal effects on a flutter mechanism. The second example of the X-43 hypersonic flight vehicle shows that the current procedure and the code can effectively solve complex practical problems with moderate computational resources. The accuracy and relative efficiency of the computational-fluid-dynamics and structural solutions are verified using actual flight and ground vibration tests.",53,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033367,"Ice accretion on aircraft wings poses a performance and safety threat as aircraft encounter supercooled droplets suspended in the cloud layer. The details of the ice accretion depend on the atmospheric conditions and the flight parameters. The icing process on the wing consists of a complex interaction of water deposition, surface water transport, and freezing. The aerodynamics affect the water deposition, the heat and mass transport, and ice accumulation; meanwhile, the accumulating ice affects the aerodynamics. Until now, most experimental measurements of aircraft icing have focused on the final ice shapes formed after exposure for a set duration to icing conditions. This approach fails to capture the transient processes that form the final ice formations. Here, we present experiments conducted in the Iowa State Icing Research Tunnel on a NACA 0012 airfoil to study the transient ice accretion process under varying icing conditions. High-speed video of the icing process was acquired under controlled environmental conditions to quantitatively measure the transient water film runback, rivulet formation, and accumulated ice growth. Image processing techniques were developed to extract physical information from the acquired image sequences of the icing events. The experiments demonstrate how varying the environmental conditions modifies the ice accretion process. It was found that the leading-edge ice growth rate is proportional to water deposition rate and the rivulet spacing and rivulet area coverage decrease with increasing wind speed. The water rivulet runback speed over the airfoil surface was found to increase rapidly with increasing wind speed.",53,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033392,"The accuracy of discretized induced velocity calculations using straight-line vortex segmentation has been examined using an induced velocity correction (curvature correction) based on a curved element with a thin core. The validity of the curvature correction has been evaluated for the prediction of helicopter rotor wakes using a free-vortex method. Numerical techniques were developed to incorporate the correction into the self-induced velocity calculations to improve the accuracy for a given discretization or to reduce the discretization for a required accuracy or computational cost. The correction was analyzed in detail to understand its validity based on its thin-core assumptions and to quantify the effect of the correction as it affects the evolution of the rotor wake. It is shown that, while the inclusion of the curvature correction can, in some cases, improve the accuracy of the induced velocity calculation for a given level of discretization, its applicability to helicopter wake problems is not guaranteed or universal.",53,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033427,"The damage tolerance of safety-critical aerospace structures is of paramount importance to ensure the airworthiness and safe operation of an aircraft. The ongoing transition from metallic to composite airframes requires a change in design philosophy to accommodate the fundamentally different behavior of composite structures in the event of damage, if future designs are not to be constrained or compromised, resulting in an inability to fully exploit the significant potential offered by composites. This work presents a feasibility study for an innovative method by which delaminations (a fundamental damage mechanism) can be steered through the thickness of a composite laminate. Plies with fibers oriented in the propagation direction are angled through the thickness in order to guide delamination migration. Static testing (mode 1) has shown the viability of this mechanism. In addition, a significant increase in fracture toughness, ranging from 88 to 269% (depending on the configuration), is observed due to delamination branching and steering away from the preferential propagation plane. Tensile and flexural testing have been performed in order to quantify the effect of this innovative architecture on the global mechanical properties. A significant knockdown in longitudinal tensile strength by up to 57% has been observed, whereas the effect on stiffness and flexural properties seems to be less significant. In addition, the potential of applying the steering mechanism in skin-stiffener debond specimens under fatigue loading has been successfully demonstrated. Similar stiffness decay as for the baseline configuration was observed over 40,000 cycles. The work in this study illustrates the potential for tailored fiber architectures, with a through-thickness feature, to provide a viable mechanism for steering critical damage into designated regions that are nonstructural or contain added functionality to mitigate that damage",53,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033370,"A series of flyover noise measurements has been taken to gather data for noise prediction, analysis, and computer program validation. A selected database of measurements is presented for the Airbus A320-200, the Boeing B737-800, and the ATR72 (turboprop). The experimental setup, the microphone positions, the effect of background noise, and the atmospheric effects are presented. It is shown that landing measurements are generally coherent with one another, with consistent peaks in noise levels and uniform noise levels from the overhead position. In contrast, at takeoff, there are considerable variations in peak noise level, which are attributed to different takeoff procedures and gross weights. Comparisons with noise predicted using ray tracing are shown. These comparisons indicate that it is possible to predict with some accuracy the noise peaks, the rise and fall of overall sound level, and the integral noise metrics (effective perceived noise level and ).",53,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033414,"A numerical procedure for load and response prediction in the context of acoustic fatigue is investigated on a model problem. Contrary to design guidelines, where the load needs to be specified (for example, based on experiments), the procedure used herein consists of simulating the load with computational fluid dynamics and then using the simulated load as a load input to a finite element simulation of the exposed structure. The model problem studied is a ramped backward-facing step with a thin aluminum panel fitted downstream of the step, parallel to the flow. The vortices generated in the wake of the step impose a time-varying load on the aluminum panel. The numerical results on the load and response are compared to experimental results. The load is simulated with large-eddy simulations with a wall function. The mean reattachment length, load intensity, and spectrum compare well with the measurements, with the exception of a somewhat overpredicted cutoff frequency. The panel response prediction compares reasonably well with the measurements, indicating that there is good potential for the proposed procedure to be used for load and response prediction in the context of acoustic fatigue analysis.",53,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033540,"The impact of buckling containment features on the stability of thin-gauge fuselage, metallic stiffened panels has previously been demonstrated. With the continuing developments in manufacturing technology, such as welding, extrusion, machining, and additive layer manufacture, understanding the benefits of additional panel design features on heavier applications, such as wing panels, is timely. This compression testing of thick-gauge panels with and without buckling containment features has been undertaken to verify buckling and collapse behaviors and validate sizing methods. The experimental results demonstrated individual panel mass savings on the order of 9%, and wing cover design studies demonstrated mass savings on the order of 4 to 13%, dependent on aircraft size and material choice.",53,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033352,"This paper develops a multi-information source formulation for aerospace design under uncertainty problems. As a specific demonstration of the approach, it presents the optimization under uncertainty of an advanced subsonic transport aircraft developed to meet the NASA goals and shows how the multi-information source approach enables practical turnaround time for this conceptual aircraft optimization under uncertainty problem. In the conceptual design phase, there are often uncertainties about future developments of the underlying technologies. An aircraft design that is robust to uncertainty is more likely to meet performance requirements as the technologies mature in the intermediate and detailed design phases, reducing the need for expensive redesigns. In the particular example selected here to present the new approach, the multi-information source approach uses an information-reuse estimator that takes advantage of the correlation of the aircraft model in the design space to reduce the number of model evaluations needed to achieve a given standard error in the Monte Carlo estimates of the relevant design statistics (mean and variance). Another contribution of the paper is to extend the approach to reuse information during trade studies that involve solving multiple optimization under uncertainty problems, enabling the analysis of the risk–performance tradeoff in optimal aircraft designs.",53,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033357,"This paper presents the investigation of the applicability of a counterpropagating laser airspeed sensor system to measure airflow velocity in the subsonic-to-transonic aircraft flight regimes. The system uses the Doppler shift of an absorption line in the -band of molecular oxygen near 760 nm combined with an independent measurement of the static pressure and temperature to determine the true airspeed. The unique experimental arrangement using laser diodes allows the possibility for fully analog signal processing, while the size and weight of the system would be appropriate for most commercial aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles flying today. Static pressure and velocity regimes were investigated in wind-tunnel tests from static pressures of 20 to 150 kPa (altitude equivalent 40,000 ft to subsea-level) and airspeeds of 5 to . It is concluded that counterpropagating laser airspeed sensor is a viable airspeed instrument for these aircraft flight regimes as well as a safety-enhancing possible alternative or supplement to pitot-based air data systems.",53,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033384,"The Federal Aviation Administration has worked with Transport Canada and others to develop allowance times for aircraft operating in ice-pellet precipitation based upon wind-tunnel experiments with a thin high-performance wing. These allowance times are applicable to many different airplanes. Therefore, the aim of this work is to characterize the aerodynamic behavior of the wing section in order to better understand the adverse aerodynamic effects of anti-icing fluids and ice-pellet contamination. Aerodynamic performance tests, boundary-layer surveys, and flow visualization were conducted at a Reynolds number of approximately and a Mach number of 0.12. Roughness and leading-edge flow disturbances were employed to simulate the aerodynamic impact of the anti-icing fluids and contamination. In the linear portion of the lift curve, the primary aerodynamic effect is the thickening of the downstream boundary layer due to the accumulation of fluid and contamination. This causes a reduction in lift coefficient and an increase in pitching moment (nose up) due to an effective decambering of the wing. The stalling characteristics of the wing with fluid and contamination appear to be driven at least partially by the effects of a secondary wave of fluid that forms near the leading edge as the wing is rotated in the simulated takeoff profile. These results have provided a much more complete understanding of the adverse aerodynamic effects of anti-icing fluids and ice-pellet contamination on this wing.",53,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033566,"In this work, measurements and a method for analyzing flight-dynamic effects on radar cross-section models for aircraft are presented. Flight-dynamic effects need to be considered when designing combat aircraft and creating target models for radar simulators. The work is based on flight data from three different types of aircraft: Piper PA-28 Archer II, Boeing 737, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. Using inertial navigation and global-positioning systems, the motions of the three aircraft are recorded in flight. From the data, aspect angles toward a radar station located in the extension of the intended flight path are generated using a simulator. It is found that the major contribution to perturbations in aspect angles is due to the rotational degrees of freedom and that bivariate normal distributions are a good candidate for approximating the uncertainty in aspect angles for all three aircraft types. It is also found that each rotational degree of freedom is close to a normal distribution but that the parameter values of the distribution vary with altitude and aircraft type.",53,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033421,"An experimental investigation was conducted on an NACA 0012 airfoil with a leading-edge horn-ice shape to identify and characterize flowfield unsteadiness related to ice-induced flow separation. This type of iced-airfoil flowfield was dominated by a leading-edge separation bubble, which is associated with several inherent modes of unsteadiness. Using unsteady surface pressure and wake velocity measurements, three distinct modes of unsteadiness were identified at various locations throughout the flowfield. These unsteady modes included a regular mode of vortical motion and a shear-layer flapping mode, which are both associated with separation bubbles. A low-frequency mode that was associated with the thin-airfoil stall type of the iced airfoil was also observed and was represented by a global oscillation of the airfoil circulation. The characteristic frequencies and flowfield locations corresponding to these unsteady modes were compared with those reported in the literature for iced-airfoil flowfields and flows about canonical geometries.",53,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033506,"Previous models employed in the computations of collection efficiencies for supercooled large droplets illustrate that the droplets’ interaction with an airfoil surface, such as bouncing and splashing of droplets, should be taken into account in the simulation to obtain accurate results. The previous supercooled large droplet models have been modified to compute the collection efficiencies for supercooled large droplets in such a way that the modified models can be adopted more effectively and suitably in the Eulerian–Eulerian approach. The modified supercooled large droplet models are implemented into the Eulerian–Eulerian approach within CFD++, which is the commercial computational fluid dynamics software suite from Metacomp Technologies, Inc. In addition, in order to account for aerodynamic droplet breakup in the Eulerian–Eulerian approach, a number density equation has been derived that includes a source term representing the rate of change of the number density during breakup. To validate the present supercooled large droplet modeling, simulations to compute icing collection efficiencies have been carried out for droplets of small and large diameters over clean airfoils and airfoils with glaze ice shapes.",53,2

In the European Strategic Wind Tunnels Improved Research Potential project, time-resolved particle image velocimetry measurements on the separated wake of the NASA Common Research Model were performed in the cryogenic European Transonic Windtunnel for flight Reynolds number conditions supplemented by aerodynamic measurements for a great variety of inflow conditions. In the time-resolved particle image velocimetry measurements, both low-speed stall (, ) and high-speed stall conditions (, ) were considered and the frequency resolution was as high as 1 kHz, enabling a sufficient characterization of the turbulent wake spectrum. For selected high- and low-speed stall conditions, hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulations were performed.

The specific criterion chosen was the angle-of-attack limit exceeding criterion, and two different cost functions were constructed that accurately describe it. Using Aero-Data Model in a Research Environment to obtain realistic aerodynamic coefficients, a longitudinal short-period model was developed. It was proven that the general system has a bang-bang worst-case input when the states are unbounded, and a possible bang-singular-bang worst-case input when one or more states are bounded. These results were validated with simulations using General Pseudospectral Optimal Control Software. In the physical domain these results translate into actuator rate limiting issues; thus, limited elevator deflection and rate of elevator deflection can lead to even more extreme worst-case performance. Experimenting with approximations of these input signals in the full model demonstrated that they achieve high maximum angle-of-attack outputs even in a complex system. Furthermore, it was confirmed that bang-singular-bang inputs in a realistic system, on average, attain a higher maximum angle of attack than bang-bang inputs.",53,2

The beneficial effects of a flexible membrane can include higher lift, steeper lift-curve slope, delayed stall, gentle stall characteristics, and greater efficiency. These benefits have been attributed to both the time-averaged and dynamic deformation of the membrane. This work discusses the geometric and prestrain effects on a batten-reinforced, free trailing-edge membrane wing in low-Reynolds-number (50,000) flow. The global aerodynamic forces on the wings with varying wing aspect ratio, cell aspect ratio, and prestrain level were measured. The results show that the aerodynamic advantages of the flexible membrane are retained for the low-aspect-ratio wings. The optimal membrane cell aspect ratio is found to be approximately 1. The comparison of the aerodynamic forces between the low-aspect-ratio membrane wings and the corresponding three-dimensional-printed wings with the time-averaged deformation indicates the importance of membrane dynamic motion for the derived aerodynamic benefits.",53,2

A time-dependent free-vortex wake for the rotors and surface singularity method for the airframe were employed to represent the carrier phase of the flow. A coupling strategy for the free-vortex method was developed to include the effects of rotors operating at different rotational speeds, such as a tail rotor. For the dispersed phase of the flow, particle tracking was used to model the dust cloud based on solutions to a decoupled form of Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equations appropriate to dilute gas/particle suspensions of low Reynolds number Stokes flow. The predicted flow fields near the ground and resulting dust clouds during the landing maneuvers were analyzed to better understand the nature and severity of their development and to examine differences produced by various rotor and airframe configurations. The formation of dust clouds was found to be partially sensitive to the transitional phase of the landing maneuver, when there were more significant aerodynamic interactions between the rotor wake and the fuselage.",53,2

The damaged fan sector consists of five blades obtained from accurate numerical simulation of the bird impact. Forced and aeroelastic response calculations are performed and compared to assess the role of aeroelastic coupling. The calculations are performed at 100, 75, and 60% throttle settings to investigate the role of engine speed on the fan response. Results from the forced response and aeroelastic response calculations indicate that the undamaged blades opposite the damaged sector exhibit the highest level of structural response. Comparing the forced response with the aeroelastic response shows increased participation of the higher structural modes, especially for the damaged blades, that grow in time or exhibit beating. Examination of the work performed by the aerodynamic forces suggests that the growth in blade response is due to aeroelastic phenomena and can cause a potential instability. The results illustrate the importance of aeroelastic effects when predicting the post-bird-strike fan response.",53,2
