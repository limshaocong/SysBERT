0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031088,"The paper describes four test methods for determining the rolling resistance of aircraft tires on unsurfaced airfields. Evaluations of a flight-test method, an instrumented-vehicle method, a soil stress-deformation method, and a tow-test method were performed on a grassy airfield. The test results showed that rolling resistance is more dependent upon surface roughness than on grass length. The benefits and usefulness of each method are also presented.",51,2

High angles of incidence are one of several critical causes of lip separation. There have been many studies into inlet performance at high incidence, including the resulting distortion levels when lip separation occurs. However, the vast majority of these investigations have been carried out experimentally, with little in the way of computational results for inlet performance at high incidence. The flow topology within an inlet when lip separation has occurred is also not well understood. This work aims to demonstrate a suitable model for the prediction of inlet flows at high incidence using ANSYS CFX, looking at both the performance of the inlet and the separated flow topology within the inlet. The attenuating effect of the fan is also investigated, with particular emphasis on the flow redistribution ahead of the fan. The results show that the model used is suitable for predicting inlet performance in adverse operating conditions, showing good agreement with experimental results. In addition, the attenuation of the distortion by the fan is also captured by the numerical model.",51,2

The helicopter undergoing flight counter 11680 experiences the most severe pitch-link loads and root torsional moments recorded in the NASA/Army UH-60A Airloads Program. The feasibility of a quasi-steady loosely coupled approach for predicting severe maneuver loads was explored for predicting critical aerodynamic and aeroelastic phenomena. The structural model is first validated through measured airloads, which helps in decoupling the physics of structural dynamics and aerodynamics. The blade aeromechanical loads, push-rod loads, and harmonic content of blade structural loads for a rotor revolution characterized by peak load factor (revolution 12) have been examined in detail. The prediction of advancing blade-stall phenomena unique to severe maneuvers and the extensive occurrence of stall are examined using contours plots of sectional airloads and through comparisons of surface pressure values.",51,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031885,"Aeroelastic divergence, which strongly depends on the torsional stiffness of the aircraft wings, is of concern in the design of aircraft. This paper examines the effect of a discrete damage, such as a crack, on the divergence dynamic pressure of a wing. The wing is represented by a simple model of a thin-walled beam with a crack with random characteristics. Two approaches are used to calculate the divergence dynamic pressure: an iterative approach when the mathematical model is difficult to analyze, and the direct approach, which can only be used if the response for the model can be expressed in closed form. For the assumed simple model of a thin-walled beam with a longitudinal crack, both approaches could be applied. The effects of the location and the size of the crack on the divergence dynamic pressure are examined. The effect of the uncertainties in the crack location and size on the divergence dynamic pressure is examined probabilistically.",51,2

The objective of this research is a framework to better understand the performance and economic requirements for this mode. An integrated modeling framework is presented in this paper that models in composite fashion a regional transportation system including three principal modes of transport: road transport, commercial air transport, and a hypothetical on-demand air service mode, which can be configured differently for each simulation. Demand forecast modeling is based on the traditional four-step process, including a multinomial logit model for traveler mode choice and the network assignment carried out on a “composite network” consisting of all the modal networks. Scenarios with varying on-demand air service network sizes and price structures are presented as case studies to illuminate the most appropriate service networks for on-demand air service. Assuming typical very light jet aircraft parameters, the studies show that most of the demand for on-demand air service lies in medium-range trips ( miles). On-demand air service comparative competitiveness is limited by its high cost for longer-range trips in spite of having superior capability. Finally, the framework also demonstrates a viable analytical tool for studying transportation systems with multimodal interactions.",51,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031975,"A time-spectral and adjoint-based optimization method was developed and applied to helicopter rotor design for unsteady level flight. The time-spectral method is a fast and accurate computational fluid dynamics algorithm for computing unsteady flows. It transforms the flow-governing equations into a periodic steady state by using a Fourier spectral derivative operator. An accompanying steady-state adjoint formulation was implemented in the time-spectral form of the governing equations to enable design optimization for unsteady flows. The time-spectral analysis was validated against conventional time-accurate computational fluid dynamics computation and flight test data of a UH-60A helicopter rotor during high-speed forward flight. A multidisciplinary analysis of blade structural dynamics was carried out through a comprehensive analysis coupling procedure that accounted for aeroelasticity and enforced vehicle trim. The adjoint-based design method was applied to optimize the blade shape of the UH-60A rotor. Power minimization was pursued with nonlinear constraints on the thrust and rotor drag force. The blade twist distribution, sectional airfoil shape, and outboard planform shape comprised over 100 design variables. Starting from the initial blade, the optimizer found a new design that showed improved performance. The validation results coupled with the multidisciplinary comprehensive analysis confirmed actual improvement: a 5% decrease in torque accompanied by a decrease in thrust of less than 1%.",51,2

The cavities have a length-to-depth ratio of 5 and a length-to-width ratio of 2, and the corresponding linear dimensions are in the ratio . The experiments were conducted with clean cavities and cavities fitted with leading-edge sawtooth spoilers so as to study the influence of scaling on clean cavities as well as the effectiveness of the passive control method on different sized cavities. The results showed significant variation of certain spectral characteristics of the clean cavities. The control effectiveness of the spoilers also showed variations with a change in scale of the model. It is recommended that, before implementing a passive control device for practical applications, the device should be tested in the possible range of cavity length-to-boundary-layer-thickness ratio that can be experienced in actual flight.",51,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032009,"A new approach to reducing low-frequency, in-plane harmonic noise of helicopter rotors is explored experimentally, and results are compared with an extended theoretical model. The active-jet acoustic control methodology employs on-blade, tip-located, unsteady air blowing to produce acoustic waves that reduce the observed noise at targeted positions in the acoustic far field of the rotor system. An extended theoretical model of the subsonic air jet, which is idealized as a source of mass and momentum, is presented. Experimental measurements in the University of Maryland acoustic chamber for an approximately one-seventh-scale rotor, operated at a hover tip Mach number of 0.661, indicate that active-jet acoustic control is a viable option for reducing low-frequency in-plane harmonic noise. Good correlation between theoretical predictions and measured data for three valve control cases are observed. Model-scale limitations of the tip-jet blowing experiment lmited the peak noise level reductions to 30%. However, theory suggests that, if the limitations of the model-scale controller were mitigated, much larger noise reductions are possible.",51,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032042,"This work presents a framework for the optimization of certain aspects of a British Experimental Rotor Programme-like rotor blade in hover and forward flight so that maximum performance can be obtained from the blade. The proposed method employs a high-fidelity, efficient computational fluid dynamics technique that uses the harmonic balance method in conjunction with artificial neural networks as metamodels, and genetic algorithms for optimization. The approach has been previously demonstrated for the optimization of blade twist in hover and the optimization of rotor sections in forward flight, transonic aerofoils design, wing and rotor tip planforms. In this paper, a parameterization technique was devised for the British Experimental Rotor Programme-like rotor tip and its parameters were optimized for a forward flight case. A specific objective function was created using the initial computational fluid dynamics data and the metamodel was used for evaluating the objective function during the optimization using the genetic algorithms. The objective function was adapted to improve forward flight performance in terms of pitching moment and torque. The obtained results suggest optima in agreement with engineering intuition but provide precise information about the shape of the final lifting surface and its performance. The main computational cost was associated with the population of the genetic algorithms database necessary for the metamodel, especially because a full factorial method was used. The computational time of the optimization process itself, after the database has been obtained, is relatively insignificant. Therefore, the computational time was reduced with the use of the harmonic balance method as opposed to the time marching method. The novelty in this paper is two-fold. Optimization methods so far have used simple aerodynamic models employing direct “calls” to the aerodynamic models within the optimization loops. Here, the optimization has been decoupled from the computational fluid dynamics data allowing the use of higher-fidelity computational fluid dynamics methods based on Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics. This allows a more realistic approach for more complex geometries such as the British Experimental Rotor Programme tip. In addition, the harmonic balance method has been used in the optimization process.",51,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032046,"A new method of characterizing the external noise radiation of rotorcraft is presented, making use of ground-based acoustic measurements. The method employs time-domain de-Dopplerization to transform the acoustic pressure time-history data collected from a fixed array of ground-based microphones to the equivalent time-history signals observed by an array of virtual in-flight microphones traveling with the helicopter. The now-stationary signals observed by the virtual microphones are then periodically averaged with the main and tail rotor blade passages, which are inferred from the acoustic signals using wavelet analysis. The averaging process suppresses noise that is not periodic with the respective rotor, allowing for the separation of main and tail rotor pressure time histories. The averaged measurements are then interpolated across the range of directivity angles captured by the microphone array in order to generate separate acoustic hemispheres for the main and tail rotor noise sources. This method facilitates a more direct comparison of ground-based noise measurements of rotorcraft with theoretical predictions and wind tunnel measurements of isolated rotors. The new method is successfully applied to ground-based microphone measurements of a Bell 206B3 helicopter and demonstrates the strong directivity characteristics of harmonic noise radiation from both the main and tail rotors of that helicopter.",51,2

The unsteady aerodynamics of miniature trailing-edge effectors and a deployable plain flap (with an equivalent lift gain) are quantified experimentally at a reduced frequency of 0.21 and a Reynolds number of . These experiments are also simulated using computational fluid dynamics. The combination of the wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics are used to quantify the aerodynamic effects of miniature trailing-edge effector deployment to compare their unsteady aerodynamics to plain flaps, and to evaluate the fluid dynamics of miniature trailing-edge effectors against experimental data. The current experiments display unsteady aerodynamics that corroborate previous computational fluid dynamics findings that indicate that miniature trailing-edge effectors shed on-surface vortices during deployment, affecting the unsteady aerodynamics of the system. Computational fluid dynamics also predicted that miniature trailing-edge effectors require 1/55 power to deploy compared to a plain-flap configuration. Power reduction is a key attractor for the integration of devices on smart rotors. This work is concluded with an effort that displays that the low power requirement of miniature trailing-edge effectors enable simple deployment methods, such as the use of pressure differentials inherent to the rotor blades. The proposed pneumatic miniature trailing-edge effector configuration was tested at centrifugal forces representative of helicopter rotor blades.",51,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032154,"We quantify the fuel and cost benefits of applying extended formation flight to commercial airline operations. Central to this study is the development of a bi-level, mixed-integer real formation flight optimization framework. The framework has two main components: 1) a continuous-domain aircraft mission performance optimization and 2) an integer optimization component that selects the best combination of optimized missions to form a formation flight schedule. The mission performance reflects the effects of rolled-up wakes, formation heterogeneity, and formation-induced compressibility. The results show that an airline can use formation flight to reduce fuel burn by 5.8% or direct operating cost by 2.0% in a long-haul international schedule. The savings increase to 7.7% in fuel or 2.6% in cost for a large-scale, transatlantic airline alliance schedule. These results include the effects of a conservative fuel reserve for formation flight. Sensitivity studies show that a modest reduction in the cruise Mach number may be sufficient to manage the impact of formation-induced compressibility effects on system-level formation flight performance. We demonstrate that the potential savings from extended formation flight (an operational improvement using existing aircraft) can approach those claimed for advanced vehicle technologies and unconventional configurations.",51,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032189,"This paper presents a novel approach to design of the supersonic aircraft outer mold line by optimizing a A-weighted loudness-based objective of the sonic-boom signature predicted on the ground. The optimization process uses the sensitivity information obtained by coupling the discrete adjoint formulations for the augmented Burgers equation and computational-fluid-dynamics equations. This coupled formulation links the loudness of the ground boom signature to the aircraft geometry, thus allowing efficient shape optimization for the purpose of minimizing the loudness. The accuracy of the adjoint-based sensitivities is verified against sensitivities obtained using an independent complex-variable approach. The adjoint-based optimization methodology is applied to a configuration previously optimized using alternative state-of-the-art optimization methods and produces additional loudness reduction. The results of the optimizations are reported and discussed.",51,2

Structural damage has been reported as a consequence of heat generated by high loads induced by rough runways on the shock absorber bearings and by the high sliding velocities of the shock absorber piston. Therefore, a model that reveals the characteristics of the thermal behavior, and identifies heat sources and sinks in the landing gear shock absorber is developed. The thermo-tribomechanical model framework is presented with representative development of each component. In addition, a sensitivity study of the maximum heat flux to variations of key input parameters is investigated. The numerical results indicate that the runway amplitude dominates the landing gear thermal response.",51,2

The shell element accommodates transverse shear deformation as well as arbitrarily large displacements and rotations. The shell element is developed using an approach that allows for compatibility with other structural elements in the Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis System. It is validated by comparing its predictions with benchmark problems. The two-dimensional shell and one-dimensional beam finite-element analyses are compared for three typical blade configurations of varying slenderness ratio: a swept-tip blade, a blade with discontinuous chordwise elastic axis and center-of-gravity locations, and a blade with a flex beam. The purpose is to quantify the differences between two-dimensional-shell one-dimensional-beam finite elements for modeling rotor blades. There is good agreement between the one- and two-dimensional analyses in predicting the natural frequencies of straight blades with a slenderness ratio of greater than 12.5. However, there are up to 16.5% differences in frequency predictions for a slenderness ratio of 17.5 or less and a tip sweep angle of 30 deg or higher. The differences increase with decreasing slenderness ratio and increasing tip sweep angle. For a blade with a discontinuous center-of-gravity offset, frequencies predicted using the two- and one-dimensional analyses show up to 12.5% difference and increase with the center-of-gravity offset. For a blade with discontinuous elastic axis offset, the frequencies predicted using the two analyses have good agreement. The differences are observed when both approaches calculate the structural loads (bending moments) and deformations of a blade with an elastic axis offset.",51,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032249,"A parameterization of the aircraft shape is needed for a correct mathematical definition of the structure and its components. The parameterization allows the definition of the geometry as a function of a few meaningful parameters. Traditionally, the aircraft industry focused on developing a universal parameterization of the aircraft outer mold line to facilitate the automatic construction of complex aerodynamic meshes to be used in computational fluid dynamics calculations and aerodynamic shape optimization problems. More recently, the attention of researchers has shifted toward the internal structure topology parameterization. The introduction of new design concepts such as SpaRibs (spars and ribs) requires the capability to define the geometric shape of the internal wing components for a correct automatic generation of the finite element mesh. The aim of this research is to present a simple and efficient way to parameterize the topology of the internal structure of complex wings. Spline curves are used to define the shape of each SpaRib in the natural space. The spacing between two SpaRibs is determined by the common ratio of a geometric progression. The parameterization of the topology of the internal structure of a simple quadrilateral wing box is presented. The same parameterization is then extended to the placement of SpaRibs in a generalized shape wing. The parameterization is used to place SpaRibs in the outer mold line of a high-speed commercial transport aircraft for structural optimization.",51,2

The proposed solver calculates the viscous wing drag using the combination of a two-dimensional airfoil analysis tool with a vortex lattice code. Validation results show that the results of the quasi-three-dimensional solver are in good agreement with higher-fidelity computational fluid dynamics solvers. The quasi-three-dimensional solver is used for a wing shape multidisciplinary design optimization. A multidisciplinary design optimization problem is formulated to design the wing shape of a typical passenger aircraft. The aircraft maximum takeoff weight is considered as the objective function. Two optimization algorithms, a local and a global optimum finder, are implemented in the multidisciplinary design optimization system. The optimization results indicate that the global optimization algorithm shows a slightly greater reduction in maximum takeoff weight. However, finding the global optimum needs about 20 times the computational time of the local optimization algorithm.",51,2

This paper presents an evaluation of potential metric systems for their suitability as a basis for an aircraft certification requirement. Candidate metric systems, consisting of a metric, a correlating parameter, evaluation conditions, and a notional limit line are assessed against a set of key criteria. The metric systems were chosen to reflect aircraft fuel consumption, which directly correlates with emissions for a given fuel type. Key criteria were identified to represent desirable attributes of the metric system, that is the ability to represent fuel efficiency performance improvements, validity across a range of aircraft types, correlation with fuel efficiency in actual operations, fairness across stakeholders, ease of measurement, and robustness against unintended consequences. The analysis showed a metric system consisting of a metric based on the inverse of the specific air range correlated with the maximum takeoff weight evaluated at 85% of maximum takeoff weight reasonably satisfied the key criteria.",51,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032295,"Time- and frequency-domain analyses are used to revisit a well studied case of an aeroelastic wing with control-surface freeplay nonlinearity. The dynamic response in general is presented as dependent on the stability of two linear systems, with zero and nominal control-surface rotational stiffness, and values of two angles, freeplay and preload. The principal new findings include the following. A physical explanation is given to the bifurcation airspeeds and frequencies of the oscillations for the system with both zero and nonzero aerodynamic preload of the control surface. For the latter and more complex case, it is shown and explained why a certain amount of the preload is not only always destabilizing but may also be the reason for the otherwise unexpected higher-frequency oscillations. A conclusion thus is drawn that the aircraft control-surface freeplay analyses based only on zero and high quenching aerodynamic preloads are nonconservative. All results are compared with the experimental and other published theoretical analyses for the considered model. Finally, a suggestion is given for future experiments with a goal to observe the response changes with the preload and to determine the stabilizing control-surface hinge moment.",51,2
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032306,"To predict the flowfield of three-dimensional wall jets, an extended nonlinear constitutive relation is incorporated into the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. A modification of the model is made to improve the predictability of free jets. The FaST aerodynamic routines code, developed at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, is used as a compressible-flow solver. First, a turbulent boundary-layer flow along a flat plate is computed to confirm the validity of the extended nonlinear constitutive relation. The obtained logarithmic velocity profile agrees well with the analytical solution. As a result, the modification is confirmed to have no adverse effects on the prediction of the typical wall-bounded flow. Second, computations of three-dimensional free and wall jets are performed, the results of which are compared with observations of the velocity field up to the far region from the jet nozzle exit, which are made by the experimental facility of Nagoya University. In free jets, reasonable computed results are obtained with respect to the streamwise decay and the half-width of the velocity, confirming the applicability of the modification to free jets. In wall jets, the modified model properly reproduces the secondary flow observed in the experiment, and its qualitative success is shown by the conservation of momentum.",51,2
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032309,"This paper presents an integrated approach based on graph theory for solving the deadlock problem in the cooperative task assignment of multiple heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles, which is concerned with the cooperative decision making and control. Because of heterogeneity, one task cannot be performed by arbitrary vehicles in the heterogeneous group. A vehicle that performs multiple tasks on targets needs to change its path, waiting for others if another vehicle that executes a former or simultaneous task has not finished or arrived. This creates risks of deadlock. Two or more vehicles may fall into a situation of infinite waiting due to shared resources and precedence constraints among various tasks. In this work, a task-precedence graph of solutions is constructed and analyzed for detecting deadlocks. And transposing operations are used to unlock solutions that involved in deadlocks. In addition, the topological sort of tasks is used in the path elongation of vehicles. Thus, deadlock-free solutions are obtained, and the path coordination is done. Computational experiments are conducted to check the performance of the approach, and the results validate the effectiveness.",51,2
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032311,"The wing rock induced by a hemisphere–cylinder forebody was investigated experimentally using an isolated delta wing and wing body. For the delta wing with sweep angle of 30 deg, no apparent limit-cycle wing rock occurs at angles of attack of 0–90 deg. The mean roll angles exhibit nonzero values at angles of attack of less than 15 deg and become zero at angles of attack of more than 15 deg. For the wing body with a hemisphere–cylinder forebody, apparent wing rock exists at angles of attack of 0–90 deg; the wing rock is induced by the forebody. The phase diagrams showed that the wing rock motion is a typical limit-cycle oscillation at lower and moderate angles of attack. With increasing angles of attack, however, stochastic components in wing rock motion are increased gradually, and the motion types start to deviate from a limit-cycle oscillation. The phase-locked particle-image-velocimetry measurements for the wing body revealed that the vortex pair over the forebody exhibits apparent dynamic hysteresis in position and strength during wing rock, and the dynamic hysteresis of forebody vortices further influence flowfields over the wing, resulting in asymmetric distributions of wing flow, which provides the driving moments sustaining the wing rock.",51,2

It allows the fast simulation of particular flight test manoeuvres designed to expose unwanted interactions between the pilot and aircraft flight dynamics. It combines a trajectory generation scheme and an aeroelastic aircraft model together with pilot models to conduct flight loads analysis relevant to trajectory-based flight test manoeuvres. The ability of the framework to assess the impact of variations in pilot control characteristics on flight loads is illustrated through the simulation of two manoeuvres. The first required the pilot to align the aircraft from an offset position in minimum time and the second required avoiding an obstacle by following a four-dimensional trajectory. Pilot models representative of pilot control behavior were derived by applying a parameter identification scheme to data gathered through a series of manual control experiments. The pilot models were coupled with a nonlinear flexible aircraft model to demonstrate the effects on pilot–vehicle system frequency response due to changes in task and intersubject differences. Worst case wing loads were then obtained and compared to aircraft loads envelopes.,51,2

This paper focuses on a practical approach to the general dynamic stability of a pararotor whose center of mass is displaced from the blade plane. The analytical study departs from the motion equations of pararotor flight, considering the center of mass displacement from the blade plane, studied over a number of simplifying hypotheses that allows determining the most important influences to flight behavior near equilibrium. Two practical indexes are developed to characterize the stability of a pararotor in terms of geometry, inertia, and the aerodynamic characteristics of the device. Based on these two parameters, a stability diagram can be defined upon which stability regions can be identified. It was concluded that the ability to reach stability conditions depends mainly on a limited number of parameters associated with the pararotor configuration: the relationship between moments of inertia, the position of the blades, the planform shape (associated with the blade aerodynamic coefficients and blade area), and the vertical distance between the center of mass and the blade plane. These parameters can be evaluated by computing practical indexes to determine stability behavior.",51,2

Inspired by this observation, an attitude control method using the real-time flow (pressure and shear) information is studied. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of using pressure information only for a micro air vehicle’s pitching control in both simulation and wind tunnel tests. In this paper, the new concept is extended to three-axis attitude controls. A new three-axis attitude motion model is developed, relating the pressure and shear information to attitude states. A nonlinear controller, which is robust with respect to bounded uncertainties, is implemented to track the attitude commands. A delta wing configuration with 20 sensor couples on the wing surface and one sensor couple on the rudder surface is proposed, designed, and tested in a simulated environment. The simulation results show that the pressure and shear information based attitude control approach can help micro air vehicles achieve accurate and robust attitude tracking control in both steady and unsteady wind conditions with a small amplitude lateral damping.",51,2
