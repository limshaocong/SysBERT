1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032418,"Results from the Fourth AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop are summarized. The workshop focused on the prediction of both absolute and differential drag levels for wing–body and wing–body/horizontal-tail configurations of the NASA Common Research Model, which is representative of transonic transport aircraft. Numerical calculations are performed using industry-relevant test cases that include lift-specific flight conditions, trimmed drag polars, downwash variations, drag rises, and Reynolds-number effects. Drag, lift, and pitching moment predictions from numerous Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics methods are presented. Solutions are performed on structured, unstructured, and hybrid grid systems. The structured-grid sets include point-matched multiblock meshes and overset grid systems. The unstructured and hybrid grid sets comprise tetrahedral, pyramid, prismatic, and hexahedral elements. Effort is made to provide a high-quality and parametrically consistent family of grids for each grid type about each configuration under study. The wing–body/horizontal families comprise coarse, medium, and fine grids; an optional extrafine grid augments several of the grid families. These mesh sequences are used to determine asymptotic grid-convergence characteristics of the solution sets and to estimate grid-converged absolute drag levels of the wing–body/horizontal configuration using Richardson extrapolation.",51,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032737,"A statistical analysis of the results from an extensive N-version test of a collection of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics codes is presented. The solutions were obtained by code developers and users from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Russia using a variety of grid systems and turbulence models for the June 2009 Fourth Drag Prediction Workshop sponsored by the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Technical Committee. The aerodynamic configuration for this workshop was a new subsonic transport model, the Common Research Model, designed using a modern approach for the wing and included a horizontal tail. The fourth workshop focused on the prediction of both absolute and incremental drag levels for wing–body and wing–body–horizontal-tail configurations. This work continues the statistical analysis begun in the earlier workshops, and compares the results from the grid-convergence study of the most recent workshop with earlier workshops using the statistical framework.",51,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032571,"In response to the fourth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop, the NASA Common Research Model wing–body and wing–body–tail configurations are analyzed using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow solvers CFL3D and OVERFLOW. Two families of structured, overset grids are built. Grid Family 1 consists of a coarse (7.2 million), medium (16.9 million), fine (56.5 million), and extra-fine (189.4 million) mesh. Grid Family 2 is an extension of the first and includes a super-fine (714.2 million) and an ultra-fine (2.4 billion) mesh. The medium grid anchors both families with an established build process for accurate cruise drag prediction studies. This base mesh is coarsened and enhanced to form a set of parametrically equivalent grids that increase in size by a factor of roughly 3.4 from one level to the next denser level. Both CFL3D and OVERFLOW are run on Grid Family 1 using a consistent numerical approach. Additional OVERFLOW runs are made to study effects of differencing scheme and turbulence model on Grid Family 1 and to obtain results for Grid Family 2. All CFD results are post-processed using Richardson extrapolation, and approximate grid-converged values of drag are compared. The medium grid is also used to compute a trimmed drag polar for both codes.",51,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032717,"The Common Research Model used by the Fourth Drag Prediction Workshop was employed to investigate the accuracy of three primary codes used at The Boeing Company for transonic aerodynamic flow analysis. The codes used in this study are CFL3D (block structured), OVERFLOW (overset structured), and BCFD (unstructured). Solutions were obtained for a wing/body configuration, with the horizontal tail at incidence angles of 0, , , and with the tail removed. Grid convergence and resolution, mesh topology, and turbulence models were considered the primary factors in this study for accurate predictions of cruise drag, pitching moments, and Reynolds number effects. Also, these factors were considered in wing and tail side-of-body flow separation predictions. In this study, all three cases (one required and two optional) were completed with all three codes. The solutions were obtained with the one-equation turbulence model of Spalart and Allmaras and the two-equation shear-stress transport turbulence model of Menter. For the trim-drag and Reynolds number effect studies (optional cases), OVERFLOW and BCFD were run only with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model.",51,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031533,"A summary about the DLR, German Aerospace Center results from the fourth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop is presented. Compared to the investigations in the previous three workshops, the latest workshop had a stronger focus on drag and trim drag predictions as well as pitching moment calculations. Therefore, the new Common Research Model developed by NASA’s Subsonic Fixed Wing Aerodynamics Technical Working Group and tested in NASA wind tunnels is used. It represents a state-of-the-art transonic transport aircraft configuration, and in contrast to the configurations previously taken, it includes an optional horizontal tailplane with three different tail settings. DLR has defined three objectives for its activities in the fourth drag prediction workshop. At first, investigations should identify solution accuracy and grid convergence behavior using prismatic element dominant grids for boundary-layer resolution in comparison to hexahedral element dominant grids. Second, the influence of turbulence models of increasing complexity is of interest regarding transonic pressure distributions and flow separations. Therefore, the one-equation turbulence model of Spalart and Allmaras, the two-equation Menter -shear-Stress-transport model, and the Speziale–Sarkar–Gatski/Launder–Reece–Rodi– Reynolds-stress model are applied. The third objective is to analyze what differences in the calculated pitching moments and horizontal tailplane trim angles can be expected for the Common Research Model with different horizontal tailplane settings when grids are regenerated for each setting or when they are deformed iteratively based on the grid for the initial setting. All investigations are performed with the grid generation software Solar and Centaur™ and the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver TAU. Recently, selected experimental data have been released by NASA and are used here for comparisons.",51,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032558,"FUN3D Navier–Stokes solutions were computed for the 4th AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop grid-convergence study, downwash study, and Reynolds-number study on a set of node-based mixed-element grids. All of the baseline tetrahedral grids were generated with the VGRID (developmental) advancing-layer and advancing-front grid-generation software package following the gridding guidelines developed for the workshop. With maximum grid sizes exceeding 100 million nodes, the grid-convergence study was particularly challenging for the node-based unstructured grid generators and flow solvers. At the time of the workshop, the super-fine grid with 105 million nodes and 600 million tetrahedral elements was the largest grid known to have been generated using VGRID. FUN3D Version 11.0 has a completely new pre- and postprocessing paradigm that has been incorporated directly into the solver and functions entirely in a parallel, distributed-memory environment. This feature allowed for practical preprocessing and solution times on the largest unstructured-grid size requested for the workshop. For the constant-lift grid-convergence case, the convergence of total drag is approximately second-order on the finest three grids. The variation in total drag between the finest two grids is only two counts. At the finest grid levels, only small variations in wing and tail pressure distributions are seen with grid refinement. Similarly, a small wing side-of-body separation also shows little variation at the finest grid levels. Overall, the FUN3D results compare well with the structured-grid code CFL3D. For the grid-convergence case, the FUN3D total and component forces/moments are within one standard deviation of the workshop core solution medians and are very close to the median values especially at the finest grid levels. The FUN3D downwash study and Reynolds-number study results also compare well with the range of results shown in the workshop presentations.",51,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032556,"Simulation results for the Common Research Model transport aircraft performed for the Fourth Drag Prediction Workshop using the unstructured computational fluid dynamics code NSU3D are presented. The solution algorithms employed in NSU3D for this study are described along with examples of convergence history. The Common Research Model aircraft configuration used for the workshop consists of the wing, body, and horizontal tail with no vertical tail or engine nacelles. The computational meshes for this study were provided by NASA Langley Research Center and were prepared with the VGrid package. A complete lift-drag polar is produced in NSU3D on a baseline mesh along with additional runs on refined and coarsened meshes to assess sensitivity to grid resolution. The effect of horizontal tail angle on the drag polar is investigated and the trimmed drag polar calculated. A range of Mach number values are evaluated, and the drag polar and drag rise curves are presented. The effect of Reynolds number is assessed by comparing computed results at Reynolds numbers of 5 million and 20 million.",51,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032641,"To shorten the time to simulate fluid flows, we develop a fast automatic grid-generation tool, HexaGrid, that produces Cartesian grids with body-fitted layers. The objective of the present study is to apply automatic grid generation to the drag prediction of the NASA Common Research Model. First, we generate a grid following the 4th Drag Prediction Workshop gridding guidelines as far as possible and discuss the capabilities and limitations of the automatic method. Then, we validate the computational-fluid-dynamics results computed with the grid by comparison with other solvers and grid generators. The HexaGrid results agree well with the other results, with the differences in predicted drag being less than five counts except at the stall angle. Additionally, we compare separated flows at the stall angle. The separation lines and distribution are found to be greatly affected by grid topology.",51,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032626,"Experimental aerodynamic investigations of the NASA Common Research Model have been conducted in the NASA Langley National Transonic Facility and the NASA Ames 11 ft wind tunnel. Data have been obtained at chord Reynolds numbers of 5 million for five different configurations at both wind tunnels. Force and moment, surface pressure, and surface flow visualization data were obtained in both facilities, but only the force and moment data are presented herein. Nacelle/pylon, tail effects, and tunnel-to-tunnel variations have been assessed. The data from both wind tunnels show that an addition of a nacelle/pylon produced an increase in drag, a decrease in lift, and a less nose-down pitching moment around the design lift condition of 0.5 and that the tail effects also follow the expected trends. Also, nearly all of the data shown fall within the 2-sigma limits for repeatability. The tunnel-to-tunnel differences are negligible for lift and pitching moment, whereas the drag shows a difference of less than 10 counts for all of the configurations. These differences in drag may be due to the variation in the sting mounting systems at the two tunnels.",51,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032389,"Results from the Fifth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop are presented. As with past workshops, numerical calculations are performed using industry-relevant geometry, methodology, and test cases. This workshop focused on force/moment predictions for the NASA Common Research Model wing-body configuration, including a grid refinement study and an optional buffet study. The grid refinement study used a common grid sequence derived from a multiblock topology structured grid. Six levels of refinement were created, resulting in grids ranging from to hexahedra, a much larger range than is typically seen. The grids were then transformed into structured overset and hexahedral, prismatic, tetrahedral, and hybrid unstructured formats all using the same basic cloud of points. This unique collection of grids was designed to isolate the effects of grid type and solution algorithm by using identical point distributions. This study showed reduced scatter and standard deviation from previous workshops. The second test case studied buffet onset at using the medium grid ( nodes) from the sequence described earlier. The prescribed alpha sweep used finely spaced intervals through the zone where wing separation was expected to begin. Some solutions exhibited a large side of body separation bubble that was not observed in the wind-tunnel results. An optional third case used three sets of geometry, grids, and conditions from the Turbulence Model Resource website prepared by the Turbulence Model Benchmarking Working Group. These simple cases were intended to help identify potential differences in turbulence model implementation. Although a few outliers and issues affecting consistency were identified, the majority of participants produced consistent results.",51,4

The solutions were obtained by code developers and users from North America, Europe, Asia, and South America using a common grid sequence and multiple turbulence models for the June 2012 Fifth Drag Prediction Workshop sponsored by the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Technical Committee. The aerodynamic configuration for this workshop was the Common Research Model subsonic transport wing–body previously used for the Fourth Drag Prediction Workshop. This work continues the statistical analysis begun in the earlier workshops and compares the results from the grid convergence study of the most recent workshop with previous workshops.",51,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032411,"Two general-purpose Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow solvers, OVERFLOW and BCFD, are used to analyze the NASA Common Research Model in a wing–body configuration. The codes are run on structured and unstructured common-grid families built specifically for the Fifth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop, allowing for a meaningful comparison of data. The results from a grid-convergence study are evaluated for each solver and grid type with focus on isolating individual effects of turbulence model and differencing scheme on computed forces, moments, and wing pressures. A medium mesh consisting of 5.1 million cells is used for a buffet-onset study to better understand variations in high-speed wing-separation prediction driven by the strengthening shock and by corner-flow physics at the wing–body juncture. Numerical simulation of side-of-body separation continues to be a challenge for Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes methods, in which solutions are sensitive to grid density and turbulence model, among other variables. However, a newly developed quadratic constitutive relation is employed with favorable results. Two additional studies are conducted to 1) investigate how well common-grid solutions compare with those on a grid built using best practices for a given flow solver, and 2) quantify the effects of transition and wing twist to provide insight on how the comparisons of computational fluid dynamics results with experimental data may be influenced.",51,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032647,"This paper summarizes studies using the multiblock structured grid solver UPACS and an unstructured grid solver FaSTAR by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency for the fifth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop test cases and follow-on problems. Computations are performed on a series of multiblock structured grids provided by the Workshop committee. For FaSTAR, the grids are treated as unstructured hexahedral grids. Other sets of multiblock structured grids and unstructured grids generated at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency are also used for computations. The following is mainly discussed: 1) grid-convergence studies for Spalart–Allmaras and shear-stress transport turbulence models using UPACS and far-field drag analyses using postprocessing software called TEBUNCO, cooperatively developed at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the University of Naples “Federico II”; 2) investigation of side-of-body flow-separation behavior at high angles of attack using UPACS with the Spalart–Allmaras or shear-stress transport model, and the change with and without a nonlinear quadratic constitutive relation model; and 3) validation of FaSTAR with the automatic hexahedral grid generator HexaGrid.",51,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032613,"Results presented at the Fifth Drag Prediction Workshop using CFL3D, FUN3D, and NSU3D are described. These are calculations on the workshop-provided grids and drag-adapted grids. The NSU3D results have been updated to reflect an improvement to skin-friction calculation on skewed grids. FUN3D results generated after the workshop are included for custom participant-generated grids, as well as a grid from a previous workshop. Uniform grid refinement at the design condition shows a tight grouping in calculated drag, where the variation in the pressure component of drag is larger than the skin-friction component. At this design condition, a fine-grid drag value was predicted with a smaller drag adjoint adapted grid via tetrahedral adaption to a metric and mixed-element subdivision. The buffet study produced a larger variation than the design case, which is attributed to large differences in the predicted side-of-body separation extent. Various modeling and discretization approaches had a strong impact on predicted side-of-body separation. A summary of similar published studies is provided to place these observations in context. This large wing-root separation bubble was not observed in wind-tunnel tests, indicating that more work is necessary in modeling wing-root juncture flows to consistently predict experiments.",51,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032622,This paper presents the results obtained with an adaptive finite-element solver for the Fifth Drag Prediction Workshop. The discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method is used for the spatial discretization of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with a modified version of the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. Drag convergence is sought via mesh adaptation driven by an adjoint-weighted residual method. Results are presented for the drag polar of the NACA 0012 airfoil under subsonic flow conditions and for the Common Research Model wing–body geometry under transonic flow conditions and fixed lift. The angle of attack that yields the desired lift is obtained via a Newton solve using the lift adjoint.,51,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032054,"This article presents the computational studies that have been performed at ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab in the context of the 5th AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop. A grid-convergence process and a buffet-onset study have been carried out using a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver and far-field methods. In this work, the multiblock grids of the Common Research Model provided by the 5th AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop Committee are employed, and a new meshing strategy involving overset techniques and Cartesian grids is tested. All of these meshes are computed with the ONERA elsA code using the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model and far-field drag analyses are performed with the ONERA ffd72 software. The grid-convergence study led with the common multiblock grids gives an extrapolated drag value close to 250 drag counts, which corresponds to the numerical median of all 5th AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop participants. The meshing approach using Cartesian grids also provides promising results. Comparisons with NASA wind-tunnel tests show reasonable discrepancies between computational fluid dynamics predictions and experimental drag measurements. The buffet-onset study completed with the medium common multiblock grid is aimed at investigating an angle-of-attack sweep at cruise Mach number. Global and local analyses combining near-field and far-field approaches are presented.",51,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032438,"This paper is aimed at presenting the computational studies that have been performed at ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab in 2013 in the framework of the 5th AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop. As data concerning the Common Research Model configuration were collected from the NASA Langley Research Center and Ames Research Center wind tunnels, a significant discrepancy appeared between the experimental and computational pitching moment evaluations. Investigations carried out by NASA in 2012 showed that the experimental model and the numerical geometry were slightly different. Indeed, at the design point, the wing twist of the experiments was stronger than the one used for the computations. Therefore, new computational-fluid-dynamics studies using the Common Research Model wing–body configuration with the corrected twist have been completed at ONERA. The common multiblock grids provided by the Drag Prediction Workshop Committee have been adequately modified before being computed with the ONERA elsA Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver and the ONERA ffd72 software. This paper exhibits the results of the new grid-convergence process and buffet study (cases 1 and 2 of the Fifth Drag Prediction Workshop). The impacts of the wing-twist modification on drag and moment productions are investigated. The grid-convergence study led with the as-tested shape in fully turbulent conditions gives a drag value close to 254 counts, which is four counts higher than the drag produced by the original numerical geometry. Moreover, to further match the wind-tunnel conditions, computations including a laminar zone up to 10% of the wing chord have been performed. These calculations with experimental wing twist and laminar/turbulent transition significantly improve the agreement between the numerical and experimental data.",51,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032598,Static fluid-structure coupled simulations were performed on NASA’s Common Research Model to assess the influence of aeroelastic effects on the numerical prediction of the overall aerodynamic coefficients and wing static pressure distributions. The numerical results of both rigid steady-state computational fluid dynamics and static aeroelastic coupled simulations were compared to the experimental data from wind tunnel test campaigns at NASA’s National Transonic Facility and the NASA Ames Research Center’s 11-Foot Transonic Wind Tunnel Facility. Coupled analyses were performed using an in-house simulation procedure built around the German Aerospace Research Center’s flow solver TAU and the commercial finite element analysis code NASTRAN®. The results show a considerable reduction of deviations between the computational results obtained during the fourth and fifth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshops and the measured data when aeroelastic wing deformations are taken into account.,51,4

Here, eddy-viscosity models with and without quadratic constitution relation extension, which accounts for the anisotropy of normal turbulent stresses, and a differential Reynolds stress model were applied. In this paper, first, the influence of turbulence models on the prediction of side-of-body separation in the wing–body region and on the overall aerodynamic force and moment coefficients is discussed, and later, the influence of grid refinement on the predictions is presented. Finally, the effect of the quadratic constitution relation extension on the predictions of eddy-viscosity models is demonstrated and performance of different turbulence models is discussed by comparing numerical predictions with the experimental data from NASA’s National Transonic Facility.",51,4
