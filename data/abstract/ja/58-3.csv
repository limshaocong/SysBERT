0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036027,"A low-order method is presented for aerodynamic prediction of wings operating at near-stall and post-stall flight conditions. The method is intended for use in design, modeling, and simulation. In this method, the flow separation due to stall is modeled in a vortex lattice framework as an effective reduction in the camber, or “decambering.” For each section of the wing, a parabolic decambering flap, hinged at the separation location of the section, is calculated through iteration to ensure that the lift and moment coefficients of the section match with the values from the two-dimensional viscous input curves for the effective angle of attack of the section. As an improvement from earlier low-order methods, this method also predicts the separation pattern on the wing. Results from the method, presented for unswept wings having various airfoils, aspect ratios, taper ratios, and small, quasi-steady roll rates, are shown to agree well with experimental results in the literature, and computational solutions obtained as part of the current work.",58,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035993,"The flows past morphing cavities with different ramps of the leading wall and the fixed ramp of the trailing wall were investigated with direct numerical simulation and dynamic mode decomposition to analyze the oscillation phenomena. Based on the analysis of pressure signal and sound pressure level spectra obtained by direct numerical simulation, an interesting fact is found that there is a transition process between fluid-dynamic oscillation and fluid-resonant oscillation phenomenon with the increasing ramp angle of the leading wall: all the modes belong to the fluid-dynamic oscillation modes in the shallow baseline cavity; the modes also belong to the fluid-dynamic oscillation modes in the morphing cavities when the ramp angle is 10 deg; the fluid-resonant oscillation modes begin to appear in the morphing cavities when the ramp angles are 20 and 30 deg, and so the coupling between the fluid-dynamic oscillation and the fluid-resonant oscillation is distinct; and all the modes in the morphing cavities are fluid-resonant oscillation modes when the ramp angle is 40 deg. Dynamic mode decomposition was employed to analyze the modal structure and determine the second-order modal type when the ramp angles are 10 and 20 deg. The modal structures achieved by dynamic mode decomposition method are consistent with the oscillation modes in the spectra.",58,3

The objective of the design process is to minimize structural mass of the wing while maintaining a target cruise shape. For this purpose, the jig shape of the wing is parameterized and becomes an integral part of the optimization, while the cruise shape is maintained by means of a constraint. Additionally strength, buckling, aeroelastic stability constraints, and a number of other design requirements have been introduced to obtain a feasible and flight-worthy design. Two wing types were designed: the reference wing and the tailored wing. The difference between the two wings is in the definition of the laminates comprising each wing. The reference wing was designed with symmetric-balanced laminates, while symmetric-unbalanced laminates were used for the tailored wing. The comparison is performed in terms of laminate stiffness and thickness distribution along the span, jig twist, and the aeroelastic response covering elastic deformations, aerodynamic load distribution, and wing root loads, showing a significant mass reduction for the tailored wing compared to the reference wing.",58,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035973,"A first principles physics-based simulation framework that accounts for wind-over-deck (WOD) and ground effects during approach and landing of a helicopter on a ship deck is developed. The WOD velocities are obtained from unsteady detached-eddy simulation of the flow over a simple frigate shape version 2 ship. The HeliUM2 flight dynamics code was modified to include WOD, static and dynamic ground effects, and landing gear models. A dynamic ground effect model that combines a finite-state wake model with a ground source distribution was also incorporated. Simulations are carried out to determine the combined effect of WOD and deck motion. Representative ship motion data are extracted from the Systematic Characterization of the Naval Environment database. A simple linear-quadratic-regulator-based flight control system is used to follow a prescribed trajectory during approach and landing. High-frequency oscillations are induced by the WOD. The entire helicopter has to be modeled to capture the complete WOD effect. In-ground-effect simulations show up to 10% reduction in rotor power consumption as well as good agreement with experimental data for a stationary deck. Deck heaving motion produces an additional change in rotor power consumption relative to the static ground effect, highlighting the importance of modeling the dynamic ground effect. The controller maintains the desired approach trajectory; and successful landing is demonstrated on level, inclined, and moving decks in the combined presence of WOD and ground effects.",58,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035763,"Hover performance and prediction for tiltrotor-like vehicles lack experimental data and computational models for rotor–wing interaction at low disk loading and low Reynolds number. An experimental investigation of rotor–wing interaction in hover near the small unmanned-air-vehicle scale (disk loading and ) is conducted to determine how changes in rotor–wing geometry influence rotor–wing interaction. The test setup consists of a rotor and a flat plate representing a generic wing. The vertical and chordwise distances between the rotor and the wing are varied to assess wing-on-rotor influence. Rotor thrust and torque, wing download force, and wing surface pressures are collected and analyzed. Trends and empirical equations are presented and discussed in the context of momentum theory. Results show that the increase in the wing download force is greater than the increase in the rotor thrust as the rotor approaches the wing. The effect is more pronounced as the disk coverage increases. The resulting empirical equations provide a preliminary estimation of rotor thrust and download force for arbitrary rotor type, disk coverage, and height in rotor–wing interaction at low disk loading and low .",58,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035991,"The recent growth of interest in hybrid-electric and fully electric aircraft has led to a renewed focus on the design and optimization of propeller aircraft. Considering propeller–wing interaction provides the opportunity to design aircraft that take advantage of aerodynamic benefits through propulsion integration. In this paper, the cruise drag of a wing with an inboard-mounted tractor propeller is minimized using aerodynamic shape optimization. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics with an actuator-disk approach is used for the simulations, and a gradient-based algorithm is used for the optimization. Changing the rotation direction of the propeller and optimizing the twist and airfoil shapes of the wing impact the aerodynamic performance significantly. However, optimizing the wing while considering the propeller slipstream provides little additional benefit compared to optimizing it without considering the propeller slipstream (the difference is less than one drag count). The wings optimized without considering the propeller slipstream are naturally able to recover swirl almost as effectively as the wings optimized while considering the propeller slipstream, and the propeller-induced velocities for the cruise condition are not high enough to lead to significant airfoil-shape design changes.",58,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036017,"A self-adaptive dissipation method based on a fifth-order dissipative compact scheme is proposed to reduce the numerical dissipation in separated flow. The method involves a self-adaptive operating parameter to adjust the weight of upwind part, which is a major source of numerical dissipation. Cooperated with delayed detached eddy simulation, the method can perform with less numerical dissipation in a large-eddy simulation region to resolve more small-scale structures, and return to normal dissipation in a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes region to stabilize simulation. Firstly, the decay of isotropic turbulence is simulated to study the influence of the method over the energy spectrum and resolution of turbulent structures. Secondly, the plane channel flow is simulated to test the stability under the pressure gradient and turbulent fluctuation. Finally, the typical separated flow over NACA0021 airfoil and circular cylinder is investigated, and the results are compared with experimental data.",58,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035887,"Airfoils tested at low speeds generally produce surface pressure distributions that differ substantially from those measured at transonic conditions, which in turn results in very different boundary-layer characteristics even for the same Reynolds number. A methodology is presented for mapping transonic pressure gradients to an equivalent low-speed airfoil. It is applied to the design of a low-speed, slotted, natural-laminar-flow (SNLF) airfoil intended to emulate the pressure gradients of a SNLF airfoil designed for a transonic commercial transport with a Reynolds number of 13.2 million. The on-design cruise operating condition of the original airfoil was chosen as the reference condition; however, the design lift coefficient of the new airfoil was lowered to account for both compressibility effects and suitability for low-speed wind-tunnel testing. The overall design process mirrors the development of the transonic airfoil by beginning with a single-element airfoil and then modifying it to include an aft element. An inverse design method based on conformal mapping was developed and employed to determine the necessary geometry of the low-speed single-element airfoil. Analysis of the new SNLF airfoil confirms that the design objectives were met, and the airfoil is found to be well behaved down to a Reynolds number of 1 million.",58,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036021,"Uncertainty based multidisciplinary analysis (UMDA) is a methodology to quantify uncertainty on the system-level quantity of interest by propagating uncertainty within and among multiple disciplines of a system. In an industrial setting, the design of complex systems involves the collaboration of multiple and diverse teams involving high-fidelity disciplinary tools and experts. Under such scenarios, engineers prefer UMDA methods based on distributed and coordination based procedures which preserve some disciplinary autonomy for uncertainty quantification and propagation. But these methods have limitations in capturing the dependence in coupling variables, which can lead to less accurate results in the system-level uncertainty. In this Paper, a methodology for probabilistic analysis of distributed multidisciplinary architecture is demonstrated in which disciplines can carry out uncertainty propagation autonomously and concurrently while accurately quantifying the dependence of the coupling variables. The method is applied on an analytical function and a supersonic jet design problem to demonstrate its capability of handing dependencies and non-Gaussian distributions of coupling variables and accurate estimation of the system-level quantity of metrics.",58,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036032,"The paper presents an aerodynamic investigation of 70 different streamlined bodies with fineness ratios ranging from 2 to 10. The bodies are chosen to idealize both unmanned and small manned aircraft fuselages and feature cross-sectional shapes that vary from circular to quadratic. The study focuses on friction and pressure drag in dependency of the individual body’s fineness ratio and cross section. The drag forces are normalized with the respective body’s wetted area to comply with an empirical drag estimation procedure. Although the friction drag coefficient then stays rather constant for all bodies, their pressure drag coefficients decrease with an increase in fineness ratio. Referring the pressure drag coefficient to the bodies’ cross-sectional areas shows a distinct pressure drag minimum at a fineness ratio of about three. The pressure drag of bodies with a quadratic cross section is generally higher than for bodies of revolution. The results are used to derive an improved form factor that can be employed in a classic empirical drag estimation method. The improved formulation takes both the fineness ratio and cross-sectional shape into account. It shows superior accuracy in estimating streamlined body drag when compared with experimental data and other form factor formulations of the literature.",58,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035836,"In this paper the application of a wing fence on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is examined. The UAV under consideration is characterized by flow separation initiating at the tip, leading to a loss of lift and controllability and the appearance of a nose-up pitching moment. A possible solution to this problem is the use of wing fences: plates placed on top of the wing aligned with the flow and developed from the idea of stopping the transverse component of the boundary-layer flow. Firstly, existing theories in regard to the working of wing fences are brought together. Secondly, the sensitivity of stall speed and controllability to the design variables of the wing fence are laid bare. Finally, the aerodynamic and stability characteristics of the UAV as a function of the design variables are assessed. To accomplish the aforementioned three objectives in both an affordable and accurate manner, computational fluid dynamics simulations using the model to correctly model the low Reynolds effects that characterize the flow over a UAV and surrogate modeling in the form of regressive universal cokriging are brought together.",58,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035911,"Hybrid wing body is a fuel-efficient aircraft configuration where the pressurized center section is confined by almost-flat panels jointed at right angles. The combination of internal pressure and in-plane loads imparts cyclic large out-of-plane deformations to the noncircular fuselage. These repeated pressure loads would lead to separation between the skin and flanges and delaminations in traditional layered composite structure. To address this challenge, researchers at NASA and The Boeing Company selected the Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) concept, an integrally stiffened panel design that is stitched together and designed to maintain residual-load-carrying capabilities under a variety of damage scenarios. Analytical and experimental results of the structural response of an all-composite 80%-scale hybrid wing body center section are presented herein. Internal pressure and mechanical loads representative of flight loads and certification requirements were imparted to the pristine and damaged structure. The pristine structure, the structure with barely visible impact damage, and the structure with discrete source damage all supported design ultimate load and displayed significant nonlinear response. Based on comparison with the test data, the finite element analysis performed before testing accurately predicted deformations, strains, and onset of localized buckling for the load cases considered.",58,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035297,"In this paper, a computationally efficient multifidelity local search algorithm for aerodynamic design optimization is presented. In this paper’s approach, direct optimization of a computationally expensive model is replaced by an iterative updating and reoptimization of a fast multifidelity model constructed using a low-fidelity model adapted locally using manifold mapping (MM) to become a reliable representation of the high-fidelity one during the optimization process. Only one high-fidelity model evaluation is needed per design iteration, and no gradient information is used. The proposed method is validated and characterized by applying it to a few single- and multipoint optimization problems involving inviscid and viscous transonic flows. The proposed method is compared with the sequential least-squares programming (SLSQP) gradient-based approach with the gradients calculated based on adjoint sensitivities. In the inviscid single-point test case, a drag reduction of 410.8 counts was achieved by the MM algorithm while requiring approximately 1469 min on a high performance computing (HPC) with 32 processors. SLSQP with adjoints achieved a drag reduction of 425.9 counts, while requiring approximately 1536 min under the same HPC setup. For the viscous single-point test case, a 83.2 drag count reduction was reported for the MM compared to 83.4 for SLSQP with adjoints. In that case, the MM algorithm was around eight times faster in terms of computing time. In the multipoint design test case, the MM algorithm was computationally cheaper by at least an order of magnitude compared to SLSQP with adjoints, although the objective function value was around three drag counts higher. Furthermore, it was found that in the multipoint cases the MM algorithm scales favorably with the number of operational conditions considered compared to SLSQP with adjoints.",58,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035895,"A high-fidelity coupled computational fluid dynamics and comprehensive analysis solver is developed for helicopter flight on Mars. The objectives are accurate prediction of flight loads and fundamental understanding of Martian aeromechanics. Performance, structural loads, pitch link loads, rotor wake, and interrotor blade separation are studied for hingeless and flap articulated coaxial rotors. In the absence of any validation data, pressure chamber tests are carried out at Mars-like conditions on a single rotor in hover. The data provided an elementary assessment of rotor behavior and a baseline for model validation. Predictions of the high-fidelity solver are also compared with a lower-fidelity lifting-line comprehensive analysis. It is generally concluded that lower-fidelity tools are not adequate for capturing the complex flow phenomena encountered on Mars. A motion and loads comparison of two fundamental hub types revealed that 1) an articulated hub has similar interrotor blade separation as hingeless on Mars, 2) a hingeless hub experiences only marginally higher (6–7%) flap bending moments, and 3) an articulated hub can lower steady pitch link loads (by an order of magnitude) at a marginal expense of oscillatory loads, 15% higher.",58,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035886,"The unsteady flows produced over the stern of a Simple Frigate Shape 2 ship model are studied in a low-speed wind tunnel. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) measurements were performed in several streamwise and cross planes. Two grids of Cowdrey rods were used to simulate the basic characteristics of an atmospheric boundary layer in terms of upstream velocity profile and turbulence intensity. The TR-PIV measurements showed large regions of unsteady flow separation, dominant vortical flows, and significant wall-normal flows over the flight deck regions caused, in part, by the irregular shedding of vorticity and turbulence from the upstream funnel and superstructure of the ship. Turbulence intensities were found to be particularly high over the flight deck. The measured flows also suggested the existence of asymmetric, intermittent flow in the near-wall regions of the deck, and time-varying fluctuations in the recirculation region behind the hangar. The crossplane measurements showed the development of shear layers at the corners of the flight deck on both the port and starboard sides, and sets of counterrotating vortices at the edges of the flight deck. An energy spectrum analysis showed dominant frequencies in the regions where the shear layer was developed behind the funnel and above the flight deck. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition revealed that the physically relevant coherent structures in the airwake were low-frequency modes near the flight deck and at large-scale of the order of the length of the deck.",58,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036216,"The second generation of supersonic civil transport has to match ambitious targets in terms of efficiency to be economically and environmentally viable. Computational fluid dynamics-based design optimization offers a powerful approach to address the complex tradeoffs intrinsic to this novel configuration. This approach is applied to the design of airfoils and wings at both supersonic cruise conditions and lower-speed, off-design conditions. Single and multipoint optimizations are performed to minimize drag over an ideal supersonic aircraft flight envelope and assess the influence of physical and numerical parameters on optimization accuracy and robustness. To obtain more favorable design tradeoffs between different flight regimes, morphing leading- and trailing-edge capabilities are introduced and their benefits are quantified against fixed-wing shapes. The optimized layouts outperform baseline supersonic reference designs over a range of flight conditions, with drag reductions from 4 up to 86% for airfoils and between 24 and 74% reductions relative to a reference wing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables the fast and effective design of highly efficient wings, capturing nonintuitive tradeoffs and offering more in-depth physical insight into the optimal layouts.",58,3

This study focuses on this issue by studying the impact of analytical and data-driven model reductions over a broad operational space. Reduced models are compared with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes predictions for steady-state aerodynamic pressure and heat flux on the surface of a complete hypersonic vehicle geometry over a broad operational space. Both accuracy and computational requirements are considered so as to provide guidance on tradeoffs when carrying out multidisciplinary simulation of high-speed vehicles.,58,3

This study focuses on adapting sandwich floor panels with structural power composite face sheets, designed to power the in-flight entertainment system.
