0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032773,"This paper builds on the Helicopter Multi-Block version 2 computational-fluid-dynamics solver of the University of Liverpool and demonstrates the implementation and use of Gurney flaps on wings and rotors. The idea is to flag any cell face within the computational mesh with a solid, no-slip boundary condition. Hence, the infinitely thin Gurney can be approximated by blocking cells in the mesh. Comparison between thick Gurney flaps and infinitely thin Gurneys showed no difference on the integrated loads; the same flow structure was captured and the same vortices were identified ahead and behind the Gurney. The results presented for various test cases suggest that the method is simple and efficient, and it can therefore be used for routine analysis of rotors with Gurney flaps. Moreover, the current method adds to the flexibility of the solver because no special grids are required, and Gurney flaps can be easily implemented. Simple two-dimensional aerofoil, three-dimensional wing, and rotors in hover and forward flight were tested with fixed, linearly actuated, and swinging Gurneys, and the ability of the code to deploy a Gurney flap within the multiblock mesh is highlighted. The need for experimental data suitable for validation of computational-fluid-dynamics methods for cases of rotors with Gurney flaps is also highlighted.",53,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032220,"For importance analysis of structural models with correlated inputs, a new method combining support vector machine regression and the single-loop Monte Carlo technique is proposed. In this new combined method, the correlated inputs are transformed to uncorrelated ones by orthogonally independent transformation first, then support vector machine regression is employed to establish the multiple-dimensional regression models involving all inputs, on which the single-loop Monte Carlo is used to obtain the importance measures of the correlated inputs. Support vector machine regression is also used to establish the one-dimensional regression model involving one concerned input. This direct support vector machine regression is proposed as a comparative method. Profiting from the high efficiency of support vector machine regression, the combined and direct methods can get the importance analysis results of the correlated inputs more efficiently than the Monte Carlo simulation. By comparing the results of combined single-loop Monte Carlo technique and those of the direct method, it is found that the former is more efficient and robust than the latter. Several examples illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods.",53,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033278,"This paper presents the theory and results for the shape and structural optimization of a platelike flapping wing. The aeroelastic system is analyzed by coupling an unsteady vortex lattice aerodynamics model with a plate finite element model. The assumptions in the aerodynamic model allow the system of equations to be calculated with the inversion of a single matrix, greatly reducing the computational cost. The design variables are the shape parameters from the modified Zimmerman method and the polynomial coefficients that describe the wing thickness. The wing shape and structure are optimized using two multiobjective optimization formulations. The first optimization minimizes the input power while maximizing the cycle-averaged thrust. The input power is the secondary objective function and is treated as a nonlinear constraint, whereas the cycle-averaged thrust is the primary objective function. A second multiobjective formulation that treats wing mass as the secondary objective function is also performed. The power-thrust-optimal wing designs minimize the contribution of the wing deformation to the input power over the flapping cycle. The mass-optimal shapes maximize the wingspan and tailor the wing thickness such that the wing deformation adds to the thrust. It is shown that, although thrust benefits from added wing deformation, it also adds to the power required to flap the wing.",53,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033415,"Micro air vehicles promise to play an important part in public, private, and military arenas in the coming years. Small, lightweight, agile, and inexpensive, these flying machines are of interest in domestic search-and-rescue operations, law enforcement, reconnaissance, mapping, and urban combat operations. Nature demonstrates that flapping wings are an extremely effective solution to the problem of hovering flight with good agility in close quarters. However, the highly unsteady, largely separated character of the flow complicates aerodynamic analysis of these vehicles, and these challenges are magnified in a design setting when the sensitivities to many geometric and kinematic parameters must be assessed. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics simulation is applied as a means to evaluate kinematic parameters of flapping wings for a four-wing, dragonfly-like micro air vehicle. It is shown that high-frequency, moderate-amplitude flapping is preferred for wings flapping in a vertical stroke plane, and increasing the feathering rotation angle also has a positive effect on performance. Comparisons have been made with horizontal-stroke-plane hovering, identifying potential benefits of this configuration, and interactions between wings are also evaluated.",53,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032777,"Today’s National Airspace System (NAS) is facing a challenge of dealing with an increasingly larger number of flight operations. To address this, the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is introduced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to improve the efficiency and safety of the NAS. Currently, the performance of the NAS is mainly measured using the delay-based metrics that cannot capture the positive aspects of the performance and level of utilization of the NAS. To address this issue, a diagnostic throughput factor analysis tool is proposed to analyze and quantify the factors that have greater responsibility for poor/better regions/times of performance of the en-route airspace using the concept of throughput. Through a function-level comparison with other applications such as ground transportation, manufacturing, and wireless communication, major factors affecting the NAS’s throughput performance are identified as Monitor Alert Parameter violation, aircraft conflict, metering, convective weather, and wind. These factors are quantitatively analyzed using the real traffic (scheduled and actual) and weather (convective weather and wind) data with the Future ATM Concepts Evaluation Tool. The proposed diagnostic throughput factor analysis tool is validated by applying it to various sectors and centers in the en-route airspace of the NAS. This tool can help the Air Traffic Controllers or the FAA improve the efficiency of airspace operations, leading to economic and environmental benefits.",53,3

This paper focuses on low-consumption electromechanical de-icing solutions based on piezoelectric transducers. After a review of the state of the art to identify the main features of electromechanical de-icing devices, piezoelectric transducer-based architectures are studied. Analytical models validated by numerical simulations allow trend studies to be performed, which highlight the resonance modes and the ultrasonic frequency ranges that lead to low-consumption, compact ultrasonic de-icing devices. Finally, de-icing systems widely studied with bonded ceramics and de-icing systems less usual with Langevin prestressed piezoelectric transducers are compared, and a Langevin piezoelectric transducer-based device leading to an interesting compromise is tested.",53,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033641,"A robust and accurate method for aerodynamic shape optimization, previously developed by the authors, is extended to automatic multipoint design of aircraft configurations with under-the-wing-mounted nacelle. The shape is optimized for minimum drag at fixed lift subject to numerous geometrical and aerodynamic constraints. The method is driven by genetic algorithms and full Navier–Stokes computations combined with reduced-order-models approach. A recently developed optimization software based on the proposed method is applied to the design of a wing combined with fuselage and under-the-wing-mounted nacelle in a close coupling installation. A multipoint multiconstrained optimization carried out in a fully automatic mode achieved significant drag reduction within and beyond industry-realistic design conditions. The results indicate the ability of the developed automatic techniques to provide industrial-strength solutions that are not easily found through a traditional process of intelligent trial and error.",53,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033382,"The aerodynamic characteristics of insect flight are investigated with the aim of developing an aerodynamic flapping-wing model for vertical and level forward flight. Models are sought that offer a compromise between physics and the rapidity of calculation. The insect prototype is the hawk moth. The wings have three degrees of freedom (pitching, weaving, and flapping) and are assumed as thin, rigid, flat plates. The aerodynamic forces and moments are determined via a quasi-steady-state model. This model is augmented with a design procedure to account for the unsteady flow due to the wake induced effects. Comparisons are shown with numerical simulations for the hover case and with experimental results for the forward-flight case. A heuristic optimization strategy (particle swarming optimization) is used to determine the set of optimal flight parameters over a range of forward speeds. It is demonstrated how this computational strategy is effective in reducing the power requirements. It is also demonstrated that the induced flow effects are strongest in the middle of the stroke. Finally, the aerodynamic effects of the wing shape are shown.",53,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033333,"The landing gear retraction system of an aircraft, including mechanical and hydraulic systems, is complex and nonlinear. It has many uncertain factors, which lead to difficulty in reliability analysis. To make the reliability analysis more accurate and efficient, some studies are represented in this paper. Taking the main landing gear of an aircraft as a research object, the dynamic equations of the retraction system were derived. The simulation model was built, combining the mechanism dynamics with the hydraulic system, and its accuracy was verified by laboratory test results. Based on this model, the paper shows how the key parameters, including the crosswind velocity, the diameter of the damping orifice, liquid capacity, friction, and oil leak, affect the performance of the landing gear retraction. After that, the limit state equation of the retraction system’s reliability was set up. For the implicit limit state equation, the response surface model of retraction reliability was established with a quadratic polynomial that has no cross terms and was verified by the Monte Carlo method. Finally, it was explained in detail how the key parameters affect the reliability of the retraction system. Some meaningful conclusions were obtained. The analysis method and its results can be references for the reliability study of the landing gear retraction system.",53,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032974,"The vertical trajectory optimization for the en route descent phase is studied in the presence of both along-track and cross winds, which are both modeled as functions of altitude. The flight range covers some portion of a cruise segment and ends at a meter fix. The descent trajectory is assumed as a flight idle descent. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem with both mixed state path constraints and pure state constraints. For minimizing environmental impacts, we optimize descent trajectory with respect to two cost functionals: fuel and emissions costs. We analyze both singular arc and boundary arc using the necessary conditions of the optimality. From the analysis result, we propose the optimal trajectory generation method, in which the optimal trajectory is generated by the backward and forward integration. The trajectory from the proposed algorithm is compared with the numerical optimal solution of the original optimal control problem. The result shows that the proposed algorithm generates the same solution as the numerical optimal solution. The wind speed, windshear, and cross-wind effects on the optimal trajectory are analyzed with two aircraft type, Boeing 737-500 and Boeing 767-400.",53,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033690,"Fatigue crack growth coupon tests play an important role in designing safe and lightweight aircraft structures. How many fatigue crack growth coupon tests are enough is an important question to be answered. With few coupon tests, there will be a substantial uncertainty in design weight, with a significant chance of getting a heavier design, and a considerable chance of overestimating fatigue crack growth design life. A simulation study is presented to determine the optimal number of fatigue crack growth coupon tests by trading off testing cost against structural weight cost. It also gives a designer an idea on how increasing the number of tests reduces the risk of overestimating design life. The tradeoff is demonstrated for the damage-tolerant design of the lower spar caps of a business jet’s wing. With eight coupon tests, there is a 26% chance of incurring at least 2.4% weight penalty and 18% chance of overestimating the fatigue crack growth life by more than 10%. For 64 tests, the chances reduce to 3 and 0.5%, respectively.",53,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033442,"A Mach-scale rotor system, 2.03 m in diameter, was built and hover tested in three configurations: two-bladed single rotor, four-bladed single rotor, and two-bladed coaxial counter-rotating rotor. The blades were untwisted with a VR-12 airfoil profile and a constant chord of 76.2 mm with a 3.8 mm trailing-edge tab. The hubs were rigid and had a vertical spacing of 13.8% rotor radius. Individual rotor steady and vibratory hub loads as well as lower-rotor push-rod loads were measured for several blade loadings up to 0.095. Mean loads were used to analyze rotor performance with an analytical momentum theory model as well as to validate an in-house, free-vortex wake model. Statistical analysis of the measured data revealed clear trends with a known confidence level. Because of mutual interference, the upper and lower rotors of the coaxial configuration consumed 18 and 49% more induced power than that of an isolated two-bladed rotor. The coaxial counter-rotating configuration was found to consume 6% less induced power than an isolated four-bladed single rotor of equal solidity. While torque-balanced, the upper rotor was found to produce 54% of the total system thrust regardless of blade loading. Rotor performance was not affected with an unbalanced torque of up to 5%. The free-vortex wake model was used to gain insight into the flow physics responsible for the interference effects by exploring the radial inflow and thrust distributions.",53,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033435,"The class of high-altitude long-endurance aircraft often has very slender wings with minimal structure. This leads to large trim deflections and coupling between the vehicle flight dynamics and wing vibrations. When this coupled behavior becomes unstable, it is referred to as body-freedom flutter. Body-freedom flutter behavior is dependent on the inertial and constitutive properties of the wing, as well as the fuselage. This relationship is explored for an aircraft representative of the Horten IV flying wing, using an efficient yet rigorous analysis that relies on geometrically exact, fully intrinsic beam equations and a finite-state induced flow model, which is implemented in the computer code NATASHA (which stands for nonlinear aeroelastic trim and stability of high-altitude long-endurance aircraft). The wing inertial and stiffness properties were calculated using a realistic representative section using the section analysis tool called variational asymptotic beam section analysis. Trade studies on the body-freedom flutter behavior were performed by varying the fuselage properties and the internal wing structure, as well as examining the effects on the flutter speed, flutter frequency, and flutter mode shape.",53,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033714,"This paper addresses the problem of estimating the supersonic air velocity from an incomplete measurement of an acoustic sensor array, that is, when some of the data are missing. Most sparsity-inducing estimators for air velocity require the discretization of the estimation grid. When the true air velocity is not on the discretized grid, this leads to grid mismatch, which results in a degradation of the performance. To deal with such an off-grid air velocity estimation problem, an off-grid, iteratively stochastic maximum-likelihood algorithm of estimating air velocity (abbreviated as Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance-Stochastic Maximum Likelihood-Air Velocity Estimation) is proposed, based on sparse asymptotic minimum-variance criterion. The proposed algorithm can achieve the off-grid air velocity estimation with high accuracy, eliminating the need of additional grid-refinement techniques. Compared with other off-the-shelf sparse estimation methods, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efficient. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is suitable for estimating the air velocity in case of missing data. Simulations are implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",53,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033577,"Several high-performance fighter aircraft exhibit store-induced limit-cycle oscillations, leading to pilot discomfort, potential structural fatigue, and flight envelope restrictions. The roles of various aerodynamic and structural factors causing the limit-cycle oscillation are not sufficiently understood, and their numerical exploration via time marching is computationally expensive. In this paper, the effects of nonlinear stiffness and damping in the wing-store attachments of the F-16 aircraft are examined, in the presence of steady flow aerodynamic nonlinearity, using the computationally efficient harmonic balance method. Structural mechanisms including cubic restoring force of both softening and hardening types, freeplay, and Coulomb friction are systematically evaluated, and the most likely among these are identified by comparing the computed limit-cycle oscillation results to flight data. An extension of the harmonic balance method to handle nonlinear unsteady aerodynamics along with structural nonlinearity is also proposed to enable rapid and accurate limit-cycle oscillation assessment of candidate store configurations.",53,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033722,"In the present paper, an aircraft control surface flight cycle is predicted considering corner flaws and through crack under transport wing standard load using the NASGRO model available in AFGROW software. The effect of corner flaws length, depth of countersunk, panel thickness, axial load to pin load, composite patch, and disbond factor on the normalized stress intensity factor, critical flight cycle, and repeat inspection interval are investigated. The typical numerical prediction of the critical flight cycle is validated with analytical estimation and published experimental results, and shows excellent agreement.",53,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033356,"Using a quasi-steady, blade-element analysis, we investigated the role of asymmetrical flapping mechanisms in hovering flight, for insect inspired micro air vehicles. The current analysis was applied to a 30 cm half-span wing, beating not more than 6 Hz. An implementation of asymmetrical flapping exhibited significantly greater lift generation, which can be attributed to the increase in angular velocity squared form for lift that occurs with increasing asymmetry. Significant improvements in the lift-to-power ratio were observed, for a house-fly-like mode of flapping, when the wing-beat frequency was below the natural frequency. At a frequency ratio of 0.3, a 75% increase in performance was observed with the use of asymmetrical flapping. At flapping frequencies above the natural frequency, however, asymmetry was found to be detrimental to performance, due to an increase in inertial forces. In a low inertia, an inclined stroke plane system, characteristic of dragonflies, we see that, in its most efficient flapping condition, asymmetrical flapping is detrimental to performance. However, in compliant systems in which elastic forces are significant, we see that asymmetry can improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the wing-actuation system.",53,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033426,"A novel mechanism is described that increases the critical buckling load of the rear wing of joined-wing aircraft in an effort to reduce structural weight. The benefits of the joined-wing configuration are briefly discussed, along with its current limitations. The behavior of the modified structure under lift is investigated by conducting a number of linear structural analyses for varying geometric arrangements. It is shown that the mechanism, called the buckling alleviation component, is effective in reducing structural weight for a significant proportion of aircraft geometries, even though there is a tradeoff between the rear wing buckling load and front wing root bending moment. A more detailed structural model is used to investigate the effect of geometric structural nonlinearities. The nonlinear analysis shows that the buckling alleviation component delays the onset of nonlinear behavior and that the critical buckling loads of the conventional configuration are drastically overestimated by the linear analysis, which means that the buckling alleviation component performs much more effectively than the initial linear analysis suggests.",53,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033636,"Experimental and computational methods were used to investigate the characteristics of a scaled, generically shaped weapons internal carriage and separation bay with a length-to-depth ratio of 4.5 at multiple Mach numbers and stagnation pressures. Three new nozzles were designed, manufactured, and characterized for the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology small supersonic tunnel, yielding freestream Mach numbers of 1.43, 1.84, and 2.22. In addition, a control valve was reconfigured to achieve stagnation pressures as low as 1.0 psia, allowing more realistic scaling. These nozzles were used in conjunction with piezoresistive pressure transducers and high-speed schlieren photography to capture the time history of the pressure and the acoustic spectra of the cavity. The nominal Mach 2.3 nozzle was used in free-drop testing of a 1:20 scaled sphere and compared with computational simulations. The computational solution was obtained using the OVERFLOW solver with incorporated six-degree-of-freedom motion and the delayed detached-eddy simulation/shear stress transport hybrid turbulence model. Analysis of the schlieren video generated by the experimental tests allowed direct comparison of computational and experimental trajectories. Measured trajectories compared closely to computational trajectories, especially for the lowest stagnation pressure settings, where heavy Mach scaling yielded operationally relevant conditions, despite the small scale of the tests.",53,3
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033658,"To implement active aeroelastic control, control surfaces on a given wing configuration are moved using actuators having their own dynamic characteristics. The inclusion of actuator dynamics leads to the coupling of aeroelastic and actuator modes, and may result in instability in the closed-loop coupled aeroservoelastic system. During the design phase, various types of actuators may be considered, and hence, the stability and performance of the coupled system needs to be evaluated. In this research, a simultaneous control for aeroelastic and actuator poles is developed, which allows for the desired pole placement in a coupled aeroservoelastic system. This enables flutter boundary extension and suppression of flutter instabilities. The design of the controller is based on the method of receptances and requires the transfer functions associated with the aeroelastic structure and the actuators. This approach also allows the partial control of some selected aeroelastic modes without influencing the actuator modes, which ensures the stability of a coupled aeroservoelastic system irrespective of the selected actuator model. Different wing models having multiple control surfaces have been considered in the simulation. By using the associated numerical receptances, several examples have also been presented to demonstrate the solution strategy and performance of the controller.",53,3
