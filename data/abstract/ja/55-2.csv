1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033808,"The ability to accurately predict both static and dynamic stability characteristics of air vehicles using computational fluid dynamics methods could revolutionize the air vehicle design process, especially for military air vehicles. A validated computational fluid dynamics capability would significantly reduce the number of ground tests required to verify vehicle concepts and, in general, could eliminate costly vehicle “repair” campaigns required to fix performance anomalies that are not adequately predicted before full-scale vehicle development. This paper outlines the extended integrated experimental and numerical approach to assess the stability and control prediction method capabilities, as well as the design and estimation of the control device effectiveness, for highly swept low observable unmanned combat aerial vehicle configurations. The aim of the AVT-201 Task Group is to provide an assessment of the computational fluid dynamics capabilities using model-scale experiments and transfer this knowledge to real-scale applications.",55,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033782,Several static and dynamic forced-motion wind-tunnel tests on a generic unmanned combat air vehicle configuration with a 53 deg swept leading edge are reviewed. The static tests include both subsonic and transonic measurements. These tests are part of an international research effort to assess and advance the state-of-the-art of computational-fluid-dynamics methods to predict the static and dynamic stability and control characteristics for this type of configuration. The tests included analysis of trailing-edge control surface effectiveness. This paper describes the data collected from three different models of this unmanned combat air vehicle configuration in four different wind tunnels. A subset of this large experimental dataset was selected as focus test cases for computational-fluid-dynamics comparison. The focus test case data are presented in detail.,55,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033700,"A contribution for the assessment of the static and dynamic aerodynamic behavior of a generic unmanned combat air vehicle configuration with control devices using computational fluid dynamics methods is given. For the study, various computational approaches have been used to predict stability and control parameters for aircraft undergoing nonlinear flight conditions. For the computational fluid dynamics simulations, three different computational fluid dynamics solvers are used: the unstructured grid-based solvers DLR TAU code and USM3D from NASA, as well as the structured grid-based National Aerospace Laboratory/NLR solver ENSOLV. The numerical methods are verified by experimental wind-tunnel data. The correlations with experimental data are made for static longitudinal/lateral sweeps and at varying frequencies of prescribed roll/pitch/yaw sinusoidal motions for the vehicle operating with and without control surface deflections. Furthermore, the investigations should support the understanding of the flow physics around the trailing-edge control devices of highly swept configurations with a vortex-dominated flowfield. Design requirements should be drawn by analyzing the interaction between the vortical flow and the control devices. The present work is part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Science and Technology Organization/ Applied Vehicle Technology Task Group AVT-201 on stability and control prediction methods.",55,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033988,"A study into the prediction of the effectiveness of different trailing-edge controls on an unmanned combat aerial vehicle configuration, on which complex vortical flow develops at moderate to high angles of attack, is described. Stability and control of these vehicles is demanding and requires early knowledge of the changes in forces and moments from control-surface deflections. Computational results are compared with data from wind-tunnel tests over the Mach number range for undeflected controls. The effectiveness of the controls at subsonic and transonic conditions is then discussed. The influence of the mesh treatment and turbulence model on the realism of the predictions is considered. The computational-fluid-dynamics predictions show good agreement with measurements and show limited sensitivity to geometry treatment and turbulence model for the flow conditions where the controls are effective. Computational fluid dynamics is shown to be capable of predicting the control-surface influence, even at high speed.",55,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033776,"This work is a contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Science and Technology Organization Task Group AVT-201 on stability and control estimation methods. Specifically, this study uses the Cobalt and Kestrel computational fluid dynamics flow solvers to predict and create reduced-order models for the aerodynamic force and moment coefficients of a generic uninhabited combat air vehicle under static and dynamic conditions and compare them with wind tunnel data. The particular reduced-order method investigated in this work is based on response functions. The geometry under investigation is known as DLR-F19, which is a lambda-wing configuration with a 53 deg angle of sweep at the leading edge. Each wing has two control surfaces on the trailing edge, hinged along the 75% chord line. Two different gridding strategies are employed: one uses an overset grid method for simulation of control-surface deflections without the need for regridding, and the other is to create a new grid for each control-surface deflection. The simulation results of these grids are compared in order to identify the effect of gaps present in the overset method. A grid is also created to study the presence of the sting geometry as tested in the experiments. Validation results are shown for different turbulence models at selected flight conditions. Overall, a good agreement between computational results and the wind tunnel experimental data for total force coefficients is achieved. However, delayed detached eddy simulations are required for angles of attack greater than 20 deg. The reduced-order modeling results show that predictions from a nonlinear model match quite well with full-order data of small amplitude motions. Small discrepancies can be seen in the plots of large-amplitude motions as well. The model predictions get worse when the belly sting geometry is included in simulations because of the nonlinear hysteresis behavior of a wake formed behind the sting.",55,2

The stability and control configuration is considered. Its geometry as well as the low-speed aerodynamics and the corresponding flow physics are well known from the literature: For medium angles of attack, the flow around the leading edge is governed by three sections: namely, an apex vortex in the front part, a region of attached flow in the middle portion, and a tip vortex in the outer part of the leading edge. The size of these regions varies with the angle of attack. In the present study, the compressible flow around this configuration has been calculated using the computational fluid dynamics DLR TAU code in the Mach number range of and angles of attack of for a constant Reynolds number of corresponding to the cruise condition of the unmanned combat aerial vehicle. With an increasing Mach number, the flow in the central region of the leading edge becomes supersonic and the upstream movement of the tip vortex with an increasing angle of attack is hindered. However, at the rear end of the supersonic zone, shock-induced separation takes place, forming an additional vortex. This shock-induced vortex joins the tip vortex. Thus, the onset of the tip vortex would move upstream again, with an increasing angle of attack passing the rear end of the supersonic zone. The corresponding, very complex vortex formation is analyzed by means of the Mach number and angle-of-attack variation. The effects of these flow phenomena on the aerodynamic characteristics are demonstrated.",55,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033696,"An industrial view on experimental and numerical investigations related to advanced combat aircraft needs is given. A critical comparison between experimental and numerical results under wind-tunnel conditions and real flight numerical simulations is presented. The Reynolds and Mach number influence on the aerodynamic behavior together with the development of the complex flowfields around generic unmanned combat aircraft configurations at transonic speed and medium and high angle-of-attack conditions is discussed. Static computational-fluid-dynamics results of forces and moments as well as the flow structure of the longitudinal and lateral flow conditions are compared to wind-tunnel measurements. Here, combat aircraft and flying-wing-type unmanned combat aircraft flow phenomena such as separation emerging at round and sharp leading edges into interacting vortex flows are shown. Also their possible development at transonic conditions causing interacting shock systems is addressed. Although wind-tunnel (low) Reynolds number, subsonic conditions are thought economic, they may be far off flight (high) Reynolds number and realistic subsonic and transonic Mach number speeds. Therefore, free-flight, full-scale conditions have also been prepared to probe the possible differences with the experimental and numerical investigations of the design and early development process of future shapes. This will show the sensitivity and possible basic uncertainty of the stability and control investigations of modern combat aircraft due to insufficient full-scale, free-flight knowledge.",55,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033820,"The next generation of agile unmanned combat aerial vehicles has put focus on the stability and control of low observable platforms. Without the traditional fin for yaw control combined with delta wings, a challenging task has been presented to the research community. The NATO research group AVT-201 was formed to meet this challenge and build on previous knowledge gained on the complex vortical flow of rounded leading-edge delta wings. This paper presents two numerical studies made by the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) and the French Aerospace Lab (ONERA) on traditional trailing-edge control and a more unconventional type of leading-edge flap control. Results from the FOI-developed flow solver Edge, using trailing-edge control, on a low observable 53 deg swept lambda wing model are compared to experimental data. The effect of leading-edge control is investigated by ONERA with a slightly smaller-scaled model, using the in-house code elsA, and validated by experimental data. Additional static and dynamic derivatives are evaluated by ONERA for the clean configuration.",55,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033818,"This paper presents cross comparisons and assessments of the aerodynamic results obtained within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Science and Technology Organisation Applied Vehicle Technology-201 Task Group. The results of five participating organizations and six different computational fluid dynamics solvers are compared to the available wind-tunnel data from the German–Dutch Wind Tunnels, and the results were obtained at low subsonic speeds for both static and dynamic cases. The comparisons help to find commonalities and disparities in the computational fluid dynamics predictions of the aerodynamics of a generic unmanned combat aerial vehicle (the stability and control configuration) and point to areas where computational fluid dynamics is challenged by nonlinear aerodynamics flow prediction. These comparisons help to show where the modeling and simulation of novel aircraft platforms in the earliest stages of design development can contribute to a more successful design process by determining difficult nonlinear aerodynamics and helping to change the design before the later stages of the design process.",55,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034268,"Control architecture sizing is a main challenge of blended-wing–body design. This aircraft configuration typically features redundant elevons located at the trailing edge of the wing, acting simultaneously on pitch and roll axes. Consequently, a proper sizing requires one to consider coupled longitudinal and lateral criteria. Moreover, significant hinge moments due to large control surface areas, combined with high deflection rates in order to safely control the longitudinal instability, may result in excessive power consumption and actuator mass penalty. Therefore, it is highly desirable at the preliminary design level to minimize control surface areas, while ensuring adequate closed-loop handling qualities, with limited deflections and deflection rates. The problem of integrated design of control surface sizes and flight control laws for an unstable blended-wing–body aircraft is addressed here. The latest tools for nonsmooth optimization of structured controllers are used to optimize in a single step the gains for both longitudinal and lateral control laws, as well as a control allocation module, while minimizing the control surface span. The following constraints are ensured: maximal deflection angles and rates for 1) pilot longitudinal pull up, 2) pilot bank angle order, and 3) longitudinal turbulence. Using this coupled approach, significant gains in terms of the outer elevon’s span as compared to the initial layout are demonstrated, whereas closed-loop handling quality constraints are guaranteed.",55,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034423,"A dynamic inflow model is used to calculate minimum induced power for a helicopter in high-speed forward flight with a finite number of blades. Comparisons between analytical and numerical results are shown, and they show good agreement. Different flow conditions (such as with and without reverse flow or inflow feedback) are used to show how each condition affects optimum induced power. Several results confirm the findings of earlier investigations, such as a singularity in rotor power in reverse flow and induced power reduction with an increase in blade number. One of the new findings is that the induced power is affected by rotor solidity (in the absence of inflow feedback) and the effect of inflow feedback does not always reduce the induced power. Results obtained using higher harmonic blade pitch control show that induced power can thereby be reduced for all conditions with a finite number of blades.",55,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034417,"A low-cost ($100) differential pressure-based commercial off-the-shelf angle-of-attack data acquisition system was designed, successfully reduced to practice, and wind-tunnel and flight tested. For the underwing-mounted probe studied, the calibration curve, based on the ratio of , is linear throughout the aircraft angle of attack if the probe is located between an estimated 25 and 60% of the local wing chord. A physics-based determination of angle of attack was successful, provided that a reasonably accurate aircraft lift curve is determined. Calculation of the lift curve slope was within of the value determined by flight test using an alpha/beta probe. The repeatability of the data from the commercial off-the-shelf system was excellent. Unnormalized differential pressure , which is dynamic pressure dependent, does not provide adequate accuracy throughout the aircraft angle-of-attack range. Hence, systems similar to that tested, which use unnormalized differential pressure and a linear calibration, are basically only stall warning devices.",55,2

Therefore, air traffic management needs to be enhanced in terms of reliability, safety, and accuracy. The main objective of this paper deals with a quadrotor flight control system that generates the necessary control laws to perform accurately, as well as possible, the reference flight trajectories. In this paper, a new quadrotor flight dynamics is developed, including an adopted wind model component where a study of the minimum phase and observability conditions is performed. Based on an adaptive backstepping control algorithm, a developed flight control system generates nonlinear control laws in an iterative and systematic procedure design. In addition to some simulations in a no-wind situation, the proposed adaptive flight control system is simulated in a windy flight condition. The design of adaptation laws according to some quadrotor parameters is developed, and the global stability of the proposed flight control system is guaranteed using the Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations are performed for the quadrotor engaged in complex trajectory tracking, and obtained results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control approach.",55,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034275,"Today’s aircraft noise calculation programs either use simple sound source descriptions with few input parameters or highly sophisticated models with input parameters, which are difficult to obtain. To fill the gap between these two approaches, an aircraft noise emission model based on regression of measured noise with aircraft flight parameters is presented. To find a reasonable compromise between the degree of detail and number of required flight parameters, an extensive data exploration was conducted. The most relevant parameters were incorporated in two multiple linear regression models, one for airframe and one for engine noise sources. An iterative method allowed fitting both regression models to aircraft flyover measurements. In total, aircraft noise emission models for 19 aircraft types were established, which underlines the general applicability of the modeling approach to turbofan-powered aircraft. Example comparisons between measurements and model predictions for two aircraft types revealed that the model accurately reproduces directivity and spectra for different flight configurations. In addition, it is suitable for the assessment and optimization of noise abatement procedures.",55,2

Motivation for the selection of this methodology is given, details of the implementation are provided, and the discretization for the interior scheme is verified for linear and quadratic elements by using the method of manufactured solutions. A methodology is also described for capturing shocks, and simulation results are compared with the finite-volume formulation that is currently the primary method employed for routine engineering applications. The finite-element methodology is demonstrated to be more accurate than the finite-volume technology, particularly on tetrahedral meshes where the solutions obtained using the finite-volume scheme can suffer from adverse effects caused by bias in the grid. Although no effort has been made to date to optimize computational efficiency, the finite-element scheme is competitive with the finite-volume scheme in terms of computer time to reach convergence.",55,2

For unmanned aircraft, such a set of correlations is not available. The current paper provides correlations based on data for 856 fixed-wing platforms. Correlations for the main mission, mass, and geometric parameters are derived through a nonlinear least-squares regression analysis. Where needed, a distinction is made between aircraft employing different propulsion systems; and the aircraft are split into five categories: piston-, battery-, turbine-, fuel-cell-, and solar-powered aircraft.

The combined code, consisting of AVINOR, a comprehensive rotorcraft analysis code, and an acoustic code called HELINOIR, is first validated against wind-tunnel tests and subsequently verified by comparing with computational results. Three rotor configurations resembling the Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm BO105 with a tip sweep, dihedral, and anhedral were simulated for level flight at a moderate advance ratio. The impact of passive blade geometry modification on in-plane noise and vibration is studied and compared to the in-plane noise reduction obtained using a single 20% chord active plain trailing-edge flap with a feedback microphone on the left boom. Active control, which is implemented using an adaptive higher harmonic control algorithm, reduces in-plane low-frequency sound pressure levels below the horizon by up to 6 dB, but there is an increase in vibratory loads. The tip dihedral reduces low-frequency sound pressure level by up to 2 dB without a vibratory load penalty, but there is an increase in the midfrequency sound pressure levels. The tip sweep and tip anhedral increase in-plane low-frequency sound pressure level below the horizon. There is a general tradeoff associated with in-plane low-frequency sound pressure level reduction, vibration performance, and midfrequency sound pressure level.",55,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034531,"Fixed-wing miniature aerial vehicles usually fly at low altitudes that are often exposed to turbulent environments. Gust soaring is a flight technique of energy harvesting in such a complex and stochastic domain. The presented work shows the feasibility and benefits of exploiting a nonstationary environment for a small unmanned aerial vehicle. A longitudinal dynamics trajectory is derived, showing significant benefits in extended flight with a sinusoidal wind profile. An optimization strategy for active control is performed, with the aim of obtaining the most effective set of gains for energy retrieval. Moreover, a three-dimensional multipoint model confirms the feasibility of energy harvesting in a more complex spatial wind field. The influence of unsteady aerodynamics is determined on the overall energy gain along the flight path with active proportional control. The aerodynamic derivatives describing the contribution to lift by a change in angle of attack and elevator deflection are identified as the most contributing aerodynamic parameters for energy harvesting in a gusty environment, and are therefore suggested as a basic objective function of an unmanned aerial vehicle design for such a flight strategy.",55,2

In this study, a mission-based aircraft preliminary design optimization methodology tailored for the assessment of adaptive technologies is presented. Its most distinguishing feature relies on each subspace representing a different mission stage instead of the traditional aircraft design disciplines. It is tailored for the assessment of adaptive solutions where the optimum design is mission stage dependent. Low-fidelity models have been used for the aircraft design disciplines. The enhanced collaborative optimization architecture has been used, with the concepts of weighting coefficient and dynamic compatibility parameter being presented and duly assessed. Benchmarking case studies results are discussed, using wingspan, wing mean chord, propeller diameter, propeller pitch, flap relative chord, and flap deflection as design variables.

20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034432,"In subsonic flow, buffeting refers to a fluid instability caused by flow separation in the flow around a bluff body or an airfoil at high angle of attack. Typically, there is a dominant frequency of these flow oscillations called the (nondimensional) Strouhal or buffet frequency. The goal of this paper was to explore the flow around a static and an oscillating airfoil at high angle of attack, and obtain a better understanding of buffet response by correlation of experimental results with existing computational methods. The effects of several parameters on the lift coefficient and flow-response frequency were studied, including Reynolds number, angle of attack, and blockage ratio of the airfoil size to the wind-tunnel dimensions. Also, more detailed flowfield characteristics were determined. For a static airfoil, a universal Strouhal-number scaling has been found for angles of attack from 30 to 90 deg, in which the flow around the airfoil is fully separated. Wind-tunnel walls lead to an increase in lift coefficient and Strouhal number. For an oscillating airfoil, the conditions for lock in are discussed. The differences between the lock-in case and the unlock-in case were also studied. The lock-in region in the confined flow is over a small range of excitation frequencies than in the unconfined flow.",55,2
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034466,"Along with flight profiles, noise–power–distance curves are the key input variable for computing noise exposure contour maps around airports. With the development of novel aircraft designs (incorporating noise-reduction technologies) and new noise-abatement procedures, noise–power–distance datasets will be required for assessing their potential benefit in terms of noise reduction around airports. Noise–power–distance curves are derived from aircraft flyover noise measurements taken for a range of aircraft configurations and engine power settings. Clearly then, empirical noise–power–distance curves will be unavailable for novel aircraft designs and novel operations. This paper presents a generic framework for computationally generating noise–power–distance curves for novel aircraft and situations. The new framework derives computationally the noise–power–distance noise levels that are normally derived experimentally, by estimating noise level variations arising from technological and operational changes with respect to a baseline scenario, where the noise levels are known or otherwise estimated. The framework is independent of specific prediction methods and can use any potential new model for existing or new noise sources. The paper demonstrates the methodology of the framework, discusses its benefits, and illustrates its applicability by deriving noise–power–distance curves for an unconventional approach operation and for a future concept blended wing–body aircraft.",55,2
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034130,"The volume of passenger air travel has increased rapidly since the first commercially viable passenger aircraft, the DC-3. Over this period, commercial aircraft increasingly appear to have consolidated around a dominant architecture. That is to say, aircraft designers have increasingly made the same architectural decisions (categorical choices such as high wing or low wing), while realizing performance gains in component technologies rather than from major architectural innovations. To quantify the assertion that a dominant architecture has emerged, in this paper, architectural decisions over time are analyzed, finding a decrease in variation of these decisions in a data set of 157 historical aircraft architectures. An architectural performance metric is defined based on passenger-carrying efficiency, technical performance, and market value, observing that, in parallel with architectural consolidation, there has been a twofold increase in average performance since the inception of the DC-3. However, the performance trend is shown to follow a trajectory similar to that of a technology S curve, implying that current improvements in performance with this dominant architecture may be reaching the stage of diminishing returns. Given current levels of activity in engine technology and potential architectural implications of large fan diameters, among other trends, this paper forms the basis for an evaluation of limits to the dominant design.",55,2

The method is based on the classic Fourier series; however, modifications are made to account for nonperiodic and nonstationary data. Convergence of the method is demonstrated by the application of the method to artificial data. Thereafter the method is applied to wind tunnel data and flight test data for two different helicopters, one with a traditional tail rotor (Bo105) and one with a modern Fenestron (EC135). The results illustrate that a traditional tail rotor displays a rather tonal noise signature very similar to that of the main rotor, only smaller in amplitude and on a shorter time scale. The Fenestron displays a more chaotic noise signature with both a tonal and a broadband noise characteristic.",55,2

Recent developments in ice-accretion documentation methods have yielded a laser-scanning capability that can measure highly three-dimensional features of ice accreted in icing wind tunnels. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the aerodynamic accuracy of ice-accretion simulations generated from laser-scan data. Tests were conducted in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel, where ice accretions were measured with laser scanning before the molding process. Aerodynamic performance testing was conducted at the University of Illinois low-speed wind tunnel at a Reynolds number of and a Mach number of 0.18 with an airfoil model designed to accommodate artificial ice shapes. The ice-accretion molds were used to fabricate one set of artificial ice shapes from polyurethane castings. The laser-scan data were used to fabricate another set of artificial ice shapes using rapid-prototype manufacturing. The iced-airfoil results with both sets of artificial ice shapes were compared to evaluate the aerodynamic simulation accuracy. The data showed that the laser-scan and rapid-prototype manufacturing approach was capable of replicating small ice features within the reported accuracies of the laser-scan measurement and rapid-prototyping methods, thus providing a new capability for high-fidelity ice-accretion documentation and artificial ice-shape fabrication for icing research.",55,2
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034353,"High-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicles are inherently highly flexible, and therefore are more susceptible to very large structural deformation in trimmed flight and in atmospheric turbulence. This work aims to avoid these large wing deformations by incorporating and deflecting multiple redundant control surfaces along the leading and trailing edges of the wing. These surfaces are used in both trim optimization to constrain wing deformation to a user-defined value in steady trimmed flight and in minimizing the dynamic response to gust encounter via a feedback controller. Trim optimization is performed using the simplex algorithm. Concurrently, a robust control scheme is designed and applied using loop shaping to demonstrate that, although the control surfaces are used for trimming the aircraft, they have enough authority left to effectively minimize elastic wing deformations during gust penetration. The aforementioned methodology is demonstrated on a highly flexible flying wing. Trim optimization effectively allows trimmed flight at various load factors in the flight envelope while maintaining small structural deformations. The designed controller significantly reduces the maximum wing deflection experienced by a gust disturbance, which is bounded below a user-specified value.",55,2

The recovery consists of an orchestrated sequence of pitch and roll maneuvers and has been studied extensively in the past using numerical optimization methods. The primary objective of this paper is to design a recovery maneuver that minimizes a physics-based proxy function for the energy loss experienced during recovery from initial conditions corresponding to climbing flight. This study also considers the case where the altitude loss needs to be minimized when the aircraft is initially in a descent. The specific proxy function used in the paper is a novel feature of our analysis and enables us to derive explicit, closed-form formulae for the high-level control inputs required for the recovery. The theoretical approach of this paper complements and explains the results of numerical optimization, and provides a computationally inexpensive alternative to numerical optimization for designing PARS. It also provides a rigorous method for refining the existing recovery maneuvers.",55,2

The current work is carried out on the basis of an in-house multidisciplinary integrated conceptual aircraft design optimization framework. An aerodynamic method based on potential flow theory is first adapted for the induced drag estimation of aircraft in formation flight. By integrating the formation flight aerodynamic methodology into the in-house aircraft design and optimization platform, the potential drag reduction for arbitrary aircraft configurations in formation can be assessed. For specific flight missions, the fuel burn reduction can be further determined. Through comparing with other simulation and experimental results, the proposed formation flight aerodynamic methods in the present work show very good agreement. A case study on two medium-range passenger aircraft indicates that the trailing aircraft could achieve up to 60% induced drag reduction with optimal longitudinal, lateral, and vertical aircraft separations within formation. The fuel burn savings of the trailing aircraft are calculated to be up to 16% for specific payload and flight range combinations. A reserve fuel study shows that around 2% fuel burn savings would be eroded due to conservative fuel planning in formation flight.",55,2
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034162,"This paper presents a framework for analyzing the stability characteristics of a very flexible aircraft, simultaneously taking into account nonlinear aeroelasticity and flight dynamics. Here, the dynamics formulation is deduced by combining the displacement-based geometric nonlinear finite element method with the nonplanar panel method, and it is linearized carefully around the trim configuration with large static deformations. A mean axis system, the origin of which is at the center of mass of the aircraft trim configuration, is used to eliminate the inertial coupling. The methodology in this paper generalizes the conventional linear analytical method to deal with stability problems of nonlinear systems and can be easily integrated into the industry design process and complex structures. The numerical results for a very flexible flying wing indicate the necessity to consider aeroelasticity and flight dynamics integrally, because the gap between the frequencies of rigid-body motions and elastic modes tends to be narrower and the coupling effects may worsen the envelope.",55,2

The technique is exercised by designing a longitudinal flight control system for a model of a flexible aircraft. The resulting design is evaluated in a computer simulation that includes a model of the human pilot. Handling qualities predictions are included. To assess robustness, the simulations include abrupt variations in the characteristics of the aircraft control system and vehicle dynamics.
