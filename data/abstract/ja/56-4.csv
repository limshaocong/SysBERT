0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034630,"Weather has been closely associated with flight safety since the beginning of aviation history, with many aviation accidents and incidents occurring due to unusual weather conditions near airports. The current aviation unusual-weather detection systems use the weather information provided by ground meteorological observation stations in the airport vicinity. They can only detect unusual weather conditions near the ground surface because all the ground meteorological observation stations are at almost the same elevation. Consequently, this Paper aims to augment the current system by collecting vertical weather information in the air from a new data source, namely, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast systems. This Paper evaluates the correlation between actual aircraft Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast data and unusual weather conditions based on several unusual-weather detection algorithms and then uses machine learning to establish the system prototype to detect aviation unusual weather. These unusual-weather detection algorithms have been verified in this Paper to distinguish between normal and unusual weather conditions. The developed machine-learning model can provide accuracy rates of close to 98% for detecting aviation unusual weather conditions. Finally, we develop a system prototype graphical user interface with which users can interact through graphical icons and indicators. Users can directly get information regarding aircraft and weather from this system prototype. The testing of the developed models is validated by the actual Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast signals broadcast by several aircraft recorded at the airport.",56,4

The optimization is divided into two phases: the VG arrangement is optimized using the NASA Common Research Model (CRM) after the VG shape is optimized on a swept infinite wing with a cross-sectional airfoil of the CRM. The shape optimization reveals that VG height and incidence angle control the aerodynamic performance under cruise and critical conditions, and VGs with higher length-to-height ratios show better performance. One of the shape-optimized VGs has been used in this study to optimize the VG arrangement to ensure static stability of the pitching moment with minimally increased drag under cruise conditions. Optimized VG arrangements can prevent shock-induced separation from propagating to wing tips around the Yehudi break of the CRM wing. One optimal solution reduces conventional VG drag penalties by 50%.",56,4

This modeling has been implemented in an overset, structured, finite difference computational fluid dynamics solver, and the predictive capabilities are demonstrated for the widely studied three-element MD high-lift airfoil. Lift forces, surface pressure distributions, and velocity profiles are compared for fully turbulent and transitional hybrid RANS/LES simulations. The inclusion of transition prediction has a net favorable effect when compared to an experimental reference; however, some discrepancies between measurement and prediction are not fully reconciled.",56,4

A force-ejection mechanism provided consistent initial velocity larger than gravity drop at several different initial pitch angles. Trajectories were observed in pitch and yaw planes with two high-speed cameras. Results reveal a mean neutral trajectory from a initial pitch angle with mean reversal for smaller and mean divergent for larger initial angle. The standard deviation of center of gravity (c.g.) displacement and pitch angle increased for all cases after passage through the shear layer with a slight bifurcation for the case. In addition, the distribution of c.g. displacement of cases showed bimodal and modal switching when the store passed through the shear layer. The statistical results revealed a bifurcation and the distribution of trajectories cannot be described as symmetric Gaussian distribution for evaluating the store trajectory.",56,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035176,"The present Paper investigates drag dispersion in computational fluid dynamics computations due to variations in the discretization domain. The application addresses typical aeronautical configurations. A Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes formulation is adopted and is solved using an unstructured implicit finite volume approach. The ONERA M6 wing is the configuration adopted for the present study. A total of 49 different grids is evaluated for this wing geometry under two flow conditions. The results obtained indicate that a variation of as much as 0.7 drag counts is expected on drag values due to the mesh effects alone, considering a 95% confidence level, in a total absolute drag of about 96 drag counts. The main contribution of the present Paper is to increase awareness of the need to assess dispersion when performing computational fluid dynamics computations and, in particular, in drag prediction. The Paper also contributes to quantifying the uncertainty associated with the use of unstructured computational meshes.",56,4

This paper focuses on the lateral deviation. During certification, the minimum control speed ground is determined in certification tests; at this speed, the allowable maximum lateral deviation is 30 ft. These tests are done with a free castering nose wheel and other requirements such as not using ailerons. These are all increasing factors. On the other hand, the aircraft manufacturer chooses the most favorable conditions, new tires, a dry runway, and no crosswind. It is unclear if the free castering nose wheel is a stringent-enough requirement to compensate for reduced runway friction, and the effect of crosswind is not considered in the certification tests. Furthermore, the rejected takeoff condition is not certified against a lateral excursion limit. Therefore, in this paper, a model is developed to determine the lateral deviation in a continued as well as a rejected takeoff, including the effect of pilot reaction time, runway surface condition, and crosswind. For the present evaluation, a Boeing 737-300 model was used.",56,4

Performance calculations on contaminated and slippery runways will result in a speed equal to -limited for a wide range of takeoff weights when using aircraft manufacturer procedures in a flight crew operations manual or computer calculations based on the policy. In this paper, it will be shown that will not be a safe speed to continue a takeoff after an engine failure in strong crosswind or reduced runway surface friction conditions. A model is used to determine the effect of these environmental conditions on lateral deviation. Apart from the continued takeoff, the lateral deviation in the rejected takeoff after an engine failure was also calculated under different environmental conditions. This resulted in advice for the use of a differential braking technique to prevent a runway excursion if a runway is not dry. A method to mitigate the risk of runway excursion on contaminated and slippery runways is presented. An evaluation, conclusions, and subjects for further research are also presented.",56,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035199,"Experimental studies on aircraft stability and performance can be enhanced by using a rig in which the aircraft model support approximates free flight within a wind tunnel. Such multi-degree-of-freedom wind tunnel rigs often impose kinematic restrictions on the aircraft model’s translational motion. This study investigates these kinematic effects, with particular attention to a spherical constraint in which the aircraft is held at the end of a fixed-length pivoting arm. Here, the motions of the aircraft and kinematic constraints are derived as differential-algebraic equations and assessed numerically. The impact is found mainly on translational motion with a negligible effect on the aircraft’s rotation. A concept to reduce these kinematic effects on the aircraft’s motion by applying an external force onto the aircraft is proposed. This compensation, which partially accounts for the constraints on the aircraft motion, is shown to reduce the effects of the arm, allowing for improved physical simulation.",56,4

This paper introduces generalized additive models (GAMs) as an efficient and effective means to this end. GAMs provide an intuitive method to determine the structure by allowing the various aerodynamic effects to be separated into an additive model. Individual effects can be modeled by a number of nonlinear smooth functions. The suitability of this method is demonstrated on the example of a simple pitching moment coefficient model that is developed using flight-test data. The ability to separate and visualize effects together with a number of statistical indicators, the relatively low computational costs, and the availability of efficient software packages make GAMs attractive for practical applications. For the work presented in this paper, the “mgcv” package of the open-source statistical software R is used.",56,4

The tests were performed at the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) 40- by 80-Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center. The model was tested at a nominal airspeed of 100 knots across rudder deflections and sideslip angles that covered the airplane’s emergency single engine climb. Active flow control (AFC) was optimized at the maximum rudder deflection of 30° and sideslip angles of 0° and . A threshold success criterion of 20% increase in the maximum side force was exceeded at largest rudder deflection using 12 sweeping jet actuators in the absence of sideslip but barely reached it with 18 actuators at the maximum sideslip at a momentum coefficient input of approximately 0.5%; consequently, 31 actuators were selected for most tests. AFC caused significant increases in suction pressure and associated side force on the actuated side. The successful demonstration of this application cleared the way for a subsequent flight demonstration on the Boeing 757 ecoDemonstrator in 2015.",56,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035286,"The recently developed parametric flutter margin method is expanded to perform efficient sensitivity studies in which linear and nonlinear flutter characteristics are calculated for changes in selected parameters. Two approaches are suggested: one for structural, aerodynamic, or control parameters that can be formulated as single-input/single-output feedback loops and one for parameters that require multiple-input/multiple-output realization. The single-input/single-output analysis is based on frequency response functions, with the formulation aiming to track the important flutter mechanisms, and is arranged such that the sensitivity to different parameters, over large-variation ranges, may be based on the same set of response functions. The multiple-input/multiple-output analysis is similarly effective but is based on eigensolutions that indicate the parametric changes needed to obtain flutter. Three numerical examples using a generic transport aircraft model, in which sensitivity with respect to stiffness and mass variations were studied, are presented. The single-input/single-output and multiple-input/multiple-output approaches are also applied for calculating damping and frequency variations with velocity that may be used as traditional plots in aeroelastic design and certification tasks. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with those obtained by separate solutions of the MSC/NASTRAN code and nonlinear time marching simulations.",56,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035211,"Independent tests of the NASA Common Research Model at NASA’s National Transonic Facility and the European Transonic Windtunnel reveal differences at low operating temperatures and high Reynolds numbers that warrant further investigation. Since each facility used their own wind tunnel balance for their tunnel entry, one suggestion for the differences was the temperature compensation methodology developed and applied for each balance. This hypothesis is explored through simulation and experiment. Independent calibrations of NASA’s NTF-118A balance at NASA Langley Research Center and European Transonic Windtunnel reveal differences in the thermal compensation of the normal force and pitching moment primary sensitivities with temperature, while the axial force primary sensitivities are in good agreement. The application of the balance calibrations performed at NASA and European Transonic Windtunnel to the prior wind tunnel data suggests that the thermal compensation differences are an order of magnitude lower than the differences observed between the wind tunnel aerodynamic coefficients. Thus, the balance temperature compensation methodologies used by NASA and European Transonic Windtunnel are not a major contributor to the wind tunnel differences.",56,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035100,"A framework for analyzing the aircraft community noise impacts of advanced operational approach and departure procedures was developed. In this framework, the altitude, position, velocity, thrust, and configuration profiles of procedures to be assessed are specified by aircraft performance. These profiles are input to the NASA Aircraft NOise Prediction Program, which requires aerodynamic performance and engine state parameters, as well as generates airframe and engine noise throughout each procedure. Generated single-event surface noise grids are combined with population census data to estimate population noise exposure. The framework’s noise estimates agree to within effective perceived noise level of available certification noise data from six aircraft types. Use of the framework was demonstrated on example departure and approach cases to show how it can be used to assess the performance and noise impacts of varying the altitude, velocity, thrust, and configuration for various aircraft. One example shows the evaluation of the noise impacts of an increased thrust departure, in which the thrust and associated altitude were increased on departure. The second example analyzed the noise impacts of altered vertical path and configuration management approaches. These included altering conventional step-down approaches to continuous descent approaches at glide slopes of 3.0–3.2 deg, as well as delayed gear approaches.",56,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035047,"The deflected slipstream is one kind of vertical takeoff and landing technology with lightweight lift machinery. Thus, the influence of different parameters on the aerodynamic characteristics of a multi-element wing under propeller slipstream is experimentally studied. The parameters concerned here include horizontal distance between propeller and wing, flap deflection angles, and inclination angle between propeller shaft and wing main chord direction. In addition, Gurney flaps are also used to further improve the aerodynamic performance. It is indicated that the horizontal distance between propeller and wing has little influence. The efficiency of first flap deflection in redirecting propeller slipstream is greater than that of the second flap deflection. The maximum turning angle can reach 44 deg, and the magnitude of resultant force can reach 78% of propeller thrust when the first flap deflects 50 deg and the second flap 40 deg for the cases when the inclination angle is equal to 0 deg. The turning angle can increase to 56 deg when the inclination angle is equal to 18 deg, which is beneficial to vertical takeoff and landing. With the addition of Gurney flaps, the turning angle can be further enhanced, though the resultant force is reduced. These findings can provide valuable reference for the implementation of vertical takeoff and landing based on deflected slipstream.",56,4

The importance of different test techniques for generating wind-tunnel data and the procedure for blending the obtained experimental data for aerodynamic modeling are discussed. Complementary use of computational fluid dynamics simulations reveals a substantial effect of the Reynolds number on the intensity of aerodynamic autorotation, which is later reflected in the aerodynamic model. Validation criteria for an extended envelope aerodynamic model are discussed, and the important role of professional test pilots with poststall flying experience in tuning aerodynamic model parameters is emphasized. The paper presents an approach to aerodynamic modeling that was implemented in the project titled “Simulation of Upset Recovery in Aviation” (2009–2012), funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Programme.

15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035203,"This paper presents an experimental study of flutter prediction via autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) system identification and the use of a linear stability parameter. System identification at subcritical (preflutter) conditions is based on measured structural responses to excitation by natural air turbulence. The current study investigates the application aspects of the methodology in a dedicated wind-tunnel experiment. An elastic wing was designed and manufactured using rapid prototyping and tested in a subsonic wind tunnel all the way to flutter. Structural responses were recorded by accelerometers, strain gauges, and fiber-optic sensors (measuring strains). The data were filtered, averaged, and used for system identification and flutter prediction. The study focuses on the prediction characteristics and accuracy, method applicability with various dynamic data, and signal processing techniques. It was shown that both accelerations and strains provide good data for system identification and accurate flutter prediction, even when sparse and short records are used. Averaging significantly improves the flutter onset prediction and its confidence bounds. The study results support the feasibility of using the ARMA method for flutter flight test.",56,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035296,"This study considers the effect of geometric nonlinearity at the design concept stage of an aircraft wing. A nonlinear finite element beam model adopting the finite volumes concept with an intrinsic strain and curvature formulation is used to size a single-aisle passenger aircraft. A linearized version of this geometrically nonlinear formulation provides a linear benchmark from which the nonlinear predictions of loads, weight, and performance can be compared. A baseline study on a wing with an aspect ratio of 18 shows that geometric nonlinearity can have a significant impact on the internal loads, leading to a reduction in the wing weight. The effect of aspect ratio is also explored, yielding optimal values at which the Breguet range is maximized and showing the effect of geometric nonlinearity on that range. This is complemented by a parameter study on the effect of varying the wing span and surface area, showing that, if gate limitations in the form of span constraints are imposed on the sizing, the optimal aspect ratio is significantly reduced and geometrically nonlinear effects are mitigated. The paper demonstrates the correlation between geometric nonlinearity and the improvements in the wing mass and Breguet range as compared to a conventional linear analysis.",56,4

The estimator does not require an aircraft dynamic model; rather, it only relies on measurements from a GPS receiver, an inertial measurement unit, and a pitot tube. The estimator is an inertial navigation system (INS)/GPS extended Kalman filter augmented with the states to account for wind and an additional measurement from a pitot tube. It is shown that the estimator is conditionally observable. Conditions (maneuvers) that enhance its observability are identified. A bound on the angle of attack and angle of sideslip estimate uncertainties is derived. The effect of INS/GPS, horizontal and vertical wind uncertainty on the accuracy of angle of attack and angle of sideslip estimate is assessed.

This paper analyzes the stability of tailsitters during taking off from and landing on the ground. A distributed propulsion tailsitter with four electrically driven propellers is studied and modeled. The pitch loop of this tailsitter can be stabilized by both aerodynamic effectors immersed in the propeller slipstream and differential thrust of the propellers installed on upper and lower wing sides. The stability criteria and stability margin of tailsitters in the landing-gear/contact-ground flight stage are defined. The open-loop stability of tailsitters on high-friction and low-friction grounds is analyzed. The closed-loop stability of tailsitters with thrust-vectoring control and trailing-edge elevators control are discussed separately. On high-friction ground or uneven terrain, the tailsitter pivots about the ground contact point instead of the center of gravity. It is shown that the ground friction/reaction forces induced by the trailing-edge elevators generate a reversed pitching moment, which makes the pitch loop of the tailsitter unstable. A Proportional–Derivative controller with thrust vectoring as an effector is given and proved to guarantee the pitch loop stability. The influences of the thrust increase rate are also discussed. The experimental results of a tailsitter unmanned air vehicle verify the conclusions of this paper.",56,4
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035050,"Fluid–structure interactions were studied on a store with tunable structural natural frequencies in complex cavity flow. Different leading-edge geometries, doors, and internal inserts generated cavity pressure fields more representative of an actual aircraft bay. The store loading and response was characterized using point pressure and accelerometer measurements, while high-frequency pressure-sensitive paint captured the distribution of surface pressure. In the complex cavity, the store responded to the cavity resonant tones not only in the streamwise and wall-normal directions but also in the spanwise direction. That spanwise response to cavity tones was not observed in a simple rectangular cavity because the flow in the spanwise direction was uniform and in phase. This different behavior highlights the importance of using a representative bay geometry and internal store for the prediction of the structural response in a flight environment.",56,4

However, due to high sensitivities of HLFC toward operational boundary conditions, estimations of its overall benefit are usually afflicted with large uncertainties. Among the critical environmental factors is the degradation of laminarity when flying through clouds at high altitudes. This paper provides an assessment on operational and economical effectiveness of HLFC aircraft with a detailed inclusion of the cloud encounter effect in three steps. First the expected time in cloud (TIC) in a real route network with cloud data given by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast is analyzed, yielding an average TIC of 10%. Subsequently, HLFC fuel efficiency with and without considering the cloud effect on mid- to long-range aircraft is dealt with. Results show an average drop of fuel benefit from 12.8 to 12.0% due to clouds. The effectiveness of lateral route optimization to reduce the impact of clouds is investigated in the last analysis. Outcomes show that these mitigation strategies are economically beneficial for few cases only. The overall picture confirms that cloud encounter must not be neglected when assessing aircraft with HLFC.",56,4

In this paper, an aerodynamics/mechanism coupling optimization design is conducted to generate a two-dimensional (2D) new-type high-lift configuration (NHCON) of “droop Fowler track mechanism coupling downward deflection of spoiler” for a very large transport aircraft. The NSGA-II algorithm is used to conduct the coupling optimization design. First, the aerodynamics/mechanism coupling optimization is conducted for the landing configuration, and the mechanism parameters are fixed. Second, the pure aerodynamics optimization under the guidance of mechanism is conducted for the takeoff configuration. Compared with the traditional high-lift configuration (THCON) generated using the pure aerodynamics optimization design, the landing and takeoff performances of the NHCON designed using the coupling optimization design are much better due to the application of the downward deflection of spoiler.",56,4

Two cylinders were tested: a classical laminated cylinder with constant-stiffness and a fiber-steered cylinder with variable stiffness in circumferential direction. Both cylinders were tested until collapse in displacement control. Displacements and strains were measured by displacement sensors, strain gauges, and two digital image correlation systems. Analysis of the test data indicates that the highest stressed area was the edges of the cutouts where local displacements created large compression strains. The experimental data were compared with progressive damage analysis results obtained with a finite element analysis that included measured geometrical imperfections.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035312,"Traditional approaches to the design and optimization of a new system often use a system-centric objective that does not consider how the operator will use this new system alongside other existing systems. When the new system design is incorporated into the broader group of systems, the performance of the operator-level objective can be suboptimal due to the unmodeled interaction between the new system and the other systems. Among the few available references that describe attempts to address this disconnect, most follow an multidisciplinary design and optimization-motivated sequential decomposition approach of first designing an optimal system and then providing this system to the operator who decides the best way to use this new system along with the existing systems. This paper addresses this issue by including aircraft design, airline operations, and revenue management “subspaces”; and it presents an approach that could simultaneously solve these subspaces while posed as a monolithic optimization problem. The monolithic approach makes the problem an expensive mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and is extremely difficult to solve. A recently developed optimization framework is used that simultaneously solves the subspaces to capture the “synergy” in the problem. The results demonstrate that simultaneously optimizing the subspaces leads to significant improvement in the fleet-level objective of the airline when compared to the previously developed sequential subspace decomposition approach. The results also showcase that maximizing the revenue and minimizing the operating cost independently need not lead to a maximized profit solution for the airline.",56,4

As a result, the dominance of other noise sources on an aircraft with geared turbofan engines is emphasized and will become more relevant. Consequently, to get an understanding of the modified noise source ranking due to the new engine concept, a noise assessment of the overall aircraft noise as received on the ground is essential: that is, a so-called system noise assessment. For this study a German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Technical University of Brunswick aircraft design synthesis process with integrated noise prediction capabilities is applied. The noise assessment is not limited to the overall vehicle noise as received on the ground but, moreover, the dominance and ranking of all individual noise sources are discussed. A direct comparison and evaluation of the flight performance and the system noise of the different vehicle variants under consideration are presented. Finally, the geared turbofan engine is also installed on an earlier low-noise aircraft concept featuring engine noise shielding. The influence of low-noise airframe measures in combination with a geared turbofan concept are promising, especially on an airframe architecture dedicated to engine noise shielding.",56,4

At and , a net profile drag reduction of 10.70% and an increase in the ratio of 14.68% was observed. PIV experiments were performed to characterize the wake velocity deficit produced by the airfoil, which showed good agreement with the drag performance across every Mach number condition. Surface-oil flow visualization experiments were also performed at the design Mach number of 0.7 to find that the airfoil experienced extensive laminar flow runs regardless of suction application, which were followed by a shock-induced laminar separation bubble before the slot location.

The computational results are compared with experimental results of an isolated flapping wing performed in an oil tank. Good agreement was observed between the experiments and numerical simulations in terms of magnitude and trend of the unsteady instantaneous lift and drag forces over the flapping cycle.

28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035124,"A characteristic feature of flows past many oscillating airfoils and wings is the leading-edge vortex (LEV). Although considerable progress has been made in the low-order modeling of LEV formation over airfoils, the prediction of LEV formation on finite wings remains a challenge. A low-order method is presented for modeling the formation of the LEV on finite wings. An unsteady vortex-lattice method has been augmented to model the effect of the LEV, which is modeled as a vortex sheet. The criticality of leading-edge suction is used to modulate the formation of the LEV at different spanwise locations of the wing. This feature enables prediction of the spanwise location of the LEV onset and the subsequent nonuniform growth of the LEV on the wing. A good comparison of the predicted flow features is seen with results from a higher-order Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes code. The predicted forces are also in reasonable agreement. The LEV sheet model has the potential to be used in a variety of low-order methods for rapid prediction of unsteady finite-wing aerodynamics.",56,4

A range of cases are investigated, including a zero-pressure gradient flat plate, a NACA0012 airfoil at varying angles of attack, a DSMA661 airfoil, a NASA High-Lift Common Research Model, and a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) standard model (JSM) high-lift aircraft model. The final three cases were computed as part of the third AIAA High Lift Prediction Workshop. For all of these, the same mesh and turbulence model is used to benchmark against the commercial CFD code STAR–CCM+. The paper shows that OpenFOAM using the Spalart–Allmaras model matches the lift and drag coefficient within 3% of the commercial code for all the test cases simulated. For the JSM high-lift aircraft for which experimental data is available, both codes show good agreement at prestall angles of attack but fail to capture the location of separation at poststall angles, even though the global lift appears to be well predicted. Although OpenFOAM demonstrated comparable accuracy to a range of CFD codes for these aforementioned test cases, further work is required to improve the robustness and stability of OpenFOAM for these types of flows.",56,4

The framework addresses a number of assumptions inherent within the surplus value theory and compares them through a commercial aviation case study, for which the potential market size is highly uncertain. The case study demonstrated that, without addressing these assumptions, a potential 380% difference in program surplus value was calculated. More specifically, the manufacturer value of the aircraft program can be calculated incorrectly by up to 900%.

The relationship between surface-normal jets with various momentum-coefficient settings, , and lift enhancement is found to be for this airfoil. It is discussed in this paper that using a surface-normal jet with can shift the linear region of the lift curve by and for the pressure- and suction-side jets, respectively. Further, employing a drag decomposition study, it is shown that, for a given , a surface-normal jet with on the pressure and suction sides of the airfoil results in a 110 drag count decrement and a 43 drag count increment, respectively, compared to the baseline airfoil with no jet. These results show that large and controllable changes in aerodynamic performance can be achieved by relatively small active flow control inputs using the surface-normal jets presented in this study.",56,4

The method used to assess acoustic shielding is based on a fast multipole boundary element method, which includes the forward flight effect. A free-wake unsteady panel method, in combination with a Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW-H) integral formulation, is used to compute the rotor noise sources for the blade vortex interaction flight condition. The prediction methodologies are described. Validation of boundary element method and the forward flight effect by means of Taylor’s transformation are conducted by using analytic solutions. The error estimation for the case without mean flow indicates that for sufficient grid resolution the maximum error occurring in the shadow region is less than 0.06 dB. The error estimation for the Taylor transformation shows that the error can be up to 6% for . In addition, a Kirchhoff source surface model used to treat the real rotor noise is described. Finally, the method is applied to a BO105 wind tunnel model to understand the noise shielding features of the main and tail rotors.",56,4
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035169,"A rapid fleet-level noise computation model is assessed to quantify errors associated with its simplifying assumptions. A method for rapidly evaluating population exposure to significant noise by mapping census block counts to square Thiessen polygons corresponding to the dimensions of the airport noise grids is also introduced. Runway utilization factors and generic-vehicle noise grids were also introduced to the rapid model to quantify errors from additional simplifying assumptions. These assumptions are convenient for rapidly accounting for runway assignments when generating flight schedules for future scenarios. The errors introduced by these assumptions are quantified by comparing against an industry-standard tool. The results show that the airports with the largest residuals for contour areas under simplifying assumptions do not necessarily correspond to the airports with the largest population residuals. Only a handful of the airports account for a large percentage of the aggregate population-exposure residuals, and these mostly correspond to busier airports in metroplexes with high population density. The results show that the baseline assumptions for the model lean toward conservative overestimates of population exposure. The accuracy of the model can be improved by modeling diverging ground tracks at a small handful of major airports, but for most airports, the standard atmosphere and straight ground track assumptions are sufficient for scenario analysis.",56,4

Diverterless supersonic inlets are designed and developed in order to provide both supersonic flow compression and boundary-layer diversion by using a three-dimensional bump in combination with a suitable cowl lip. The present experiments were performed at three different freestream Mach numbers of , 1.65 (the design Mach number), and 1.85, as well as at 0 deg angles of attack and angles of sideslip. To model the performance accurately, the intake was integrated with a typical forebody including a nose with an elliptical cross section. Wind-tunnel tests were conducted at critical, subcritical, and supercritical operating conditions. The results showed that the present DSI has acceptable performance in these operating conditions and is able to provide the required mass flow and static pressure ratios. For all conditions examined in this study, as a significant result, the fixed geometry of the designed DSI showed acceptable performance in the ranges of supersonic Mach numbers tested: ; furthermore, its operation in the subsonic condition of was satisfactory. It should be mentioned that there were no movable parts or an auxiliary flow control system for this intake.",56,4
