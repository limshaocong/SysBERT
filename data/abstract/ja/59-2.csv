0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036214,"This paper proposes a conceptual methodology for designing vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with a hybrid-electric propulsion system as an alternative to facilitate intercity missions for urban air mobility. Four new modules are developed to consider the diversity of configurations, flight mechanisms, and hybrid-electric propulsion system architectures. The flight-analysis module is proposed to account for various lift- and thrust-generating devices. The hybrid-electric propulsion system sizing module is modified for the vertical takeoff and landing aircraft by additionally considering transition flight. Based on a new proposed battery charge/discharge criterion, the mission-analysis module is constructed to predict the battery capacity and fuel consumption required for a given mission. The weight-estimation module is also developed considering the weight of the mechanical and electric powertrains. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by designing an urban air mobility vehicle and comparing the results with those of other sizing tools. A systematic comparative study and design optimization are carried out to highlight the improvement in the performance of the hybrid-electric-powered vertical takeoff and landing aircraft compared to its battery-driven counterpart. The extended mission range of the designed aircraft presents the possibility of intercity urban air mobility vehicles.",59,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036285,"A nonlinear aeroelastic analysis framework for high-aspect-ratio wings that includes the aerodynamic effects of propellers is described. The high computational cost required for modeling aerodynamic interaction between the wing and propeller wake is reduced by taking advantage of the relatively slow dynamics of the wing. Consequently, the propeller wake is modeled as a straight vortex cylinder that does not require a computationally expensive wake updating process. By leveraging the smallness of the propeller, an averaged vortex cylinder method is proposed that calculates the induced velocities of the propeller vortex cylinder efficiently without suffering from a numerical singularity and loss of accuracy. The induced velocities are considered in the wing aerodynamic force calculation using an unsteady vortex lattice method. An efficient propeller cylinder coordinate generation method modeling the propeller-attached wing by absolute nodal coordinate formulation with a multibody dynamic theory is also proposed. The developed framework is validated by comparison with other formulations. A static aeroelastic analysis on a low-speed high-aspect-ratio wing demonstrates that the propeller-induced axial velocity causes the deflection change of 5.4%. A nonlinear dynamic result shows that the propeller decreases the vibration amplitude by 6.7% because the propeller-induced axial velocity enhances the aerodynamic damping.",59,2

The purpose was to validate and expand day/night vertical launch and recovery wind envelopes, and the development of short takeoff and minimum run-on landing wind envelopes. The preparation phase incorporated a six-degree-of-freedom motion flight simulator to evaluate flight dynamics prior to on-shore testing using V-22 developmental and production aircraft. The short takeoff and minimum run-on landing testing totaled 12.3 flight hours with 33 takeoffs and 32 landings. The gross weights ranged from 51,000 to 57,000 lb with of relative wind from 0 to 45 kt. The test pilots provided assessments of handling and flying qualities throughout the maneuvers using the deck interface pilot effort scale. Predictability tests were required to determine the pilot’s ability to land within the defined touchdown zone and speeds for safely stopping within the braking zone. The results show the integrated nature of shipboard flight testing and the process of combining pilot workload ratings, control strategies, and aerodynamic analyses to field a needed capability.",59,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036552,"Fins play a vital role in improving the directional stability of aerial vehicles. However, airships are characterized by an inherent directional instability due to undersized fins. In this paper, a systematic approach to the design of airship fins is proposed. A constrained optimization problem is formulated to identify the optimal location, span, and chord of the airship fins. A semi-empirical aerodynamic model is used to formulate the objective function that represents the directional instability of an airship. The validity of the numerical solution acquired by minimizing the objective function with other design constraints is shown through a series of wind tunnel experiments. The result of the experiments confirms that the outcome of the fin optimization problem exhibits the best performance among the test cases, which validates the proposed methodology for designing the fins of the airship.",59,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036328,"Airworthiness certification is a mandatory but expensive process in aircraft development. To reduce certification cost, it is desired to incorporate certification considerations into aircraft early design stages. The tradeoff between performance and certification constraints and the interactions between the behind-the-scene disciplines require a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) method implemented to incorporate certification considerations. Several MDO frameworks currently exist with mixing levels of fidelity and multidisciplinary coupling. However, few of them capture the impacts of certification constraints on the overall aircraft performance. Moreover, preceding MDO studies have mostly focused on optimizing a single design point, whereas little attention is paid to design space exploration. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a certification-driven platform for airframe early preliminary design. With statistical methods applied, this platform allows efficient design space exploration and multi-objective optimization. To demonstrate the capabilities of this platform, a test case of preliminary horizontal tail design of a large twin-aisle aircraft is performed. The feasibility test and multi-objective optimization conducted in the test case prove that certification constraints play a critical role in the design space exploration at the early preliminary stage.",59,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036154,"In this paper, the low-speed aerodynamic characteristics of a basic wing–fuselage supersonic biplane incorporating trailing-edge flaps are assessed using both wake and balance measurements. The effects of the flap attachment location, flap deflection, and flap length are evaluated. These experiments employed a flow velocity of and a Reynolds number of , along with a model having a simple three-dimensional wing–fuselage supersonic biplane configuration; and wake data were obtained with a five-hole probe. Installing the flap near the wingtip was found to produce strong interactions between the wingtip and the flap vortices in the wake, leading to significant induced drag at the wingtip. The local lift increases not only at the flap attachment location but also over the entire wingspan. Positioning the flaps near the body is determined to be more effective, and it gives rise to higher lift and smaller drag than in the case of installing the flap near the wingtip, due to the effects of the tapered wing configuration. The effects of the flap length and flap deflection are also confirmed, with longer flaps and larger flap deflection giving higher lift and more drag.",59,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036561,"Condition-based maintenance programs for modern helicopters rely on algorithmic techniques to estimate the useful life remaining for life-limited components. Regime-recognition-based condition-based maintenance programs involve a regime recognition step and a damage estimation step in which damage is calculated based on the identified regimes. Recently, new probabilistic regime recognition algorithms have been developed that produce probability distributions over the regimes, rather than deterministic regime classifications. However, to date, there has been no method to convert regime distributions to damage estimates. This paper proposes a technique to compute a probability distribution over the fatigue damage for each life-limited component directly from the regime probability distributions. The method treats the incurred damage at a given time as a random variable and accumulates the total damage incurred as a sum of random variables. The damage distribution at each time is computed from the regime distribution and the regime damage rates. A primary advantage of the approach is that it captures uncertainty in the regime recognition process by treating damage as a random variable rather than a deterministic value. Simulation results illustrate the benefit of the probabilistic approach over a deterministic method, particularly for flights where there is significant uncertainty in the flown regimes.",59,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036569,"Aircraft structures experience various kinds of loads over their entire lifetime, typically leading to fatigue, and ultimately structural failure. To avoid structural failure during operation, the maximum number of flight cycles and flight hours is regulated by laws ensuring continued airworthiness. However, because every flight impacts the aircraft differently, not all airframes are equally stressed at the time of decommissioning. This paper proposes a new retirement criterion based on the so-called fatigue damage index (FDI). The criterion takes into account that aircraft are differently operated and thus enables an individual decommissioning of aircraft without compromising its safety. Based on aircraft sample data covering 95% of the Airbus A320 fleet over two years, the enhanced decommissioning criterion is estimated to significantly extend the average aircraft service life. The impact varies within the fleet, depending on the experienced seat load factors, cruise altitudes, and taxi times considered for the individual aircraft during operation. Whereas seat load factors and flight altitudes significantly affect the defined FDI, the influence of taxi times is only minor. Based on the estimated increase in aircraft service life, the paper argues that for service life extensions, the FDI shall be considered as the limit of validity in the regulatory framework governing the decommissioning of aircraft.",59,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036551,"This paper presents an approach for optimizing practical commercial-scale aircraft wings using sandwich composites in a preliminary design stage. The approach uses lamination parameters as design variables in a continuous optimization step. Structural constraints for classic composite laminate design such as material failure and buckling, and for sandwich design such as crimping, wrinkling, dimpling, and core shear failure are accounted for using industrial-standard and empirical methods driven by finite element analyses. As an application case, optimization studies are performed at a skin panel level on the open-source Common Research Model wing. Optimization trends show areas of the wingbox where sandwich composites offer superior structural performance, as well as potential cost savings by requiring lesser number of stringers. The aim and novelty of this work is to present performance gains that can be achieved using sandwich composites in primary load-carrying aircraft structures when compared with monolithic composite designs and, through this, to provide a motivation for further research and development in sandwich composites and their applications.",59,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036395,"To achieve improvements in aircraft efficiency and reduced environmental footprint, aircraft must incorporate novel concepts, architectures, and technologies, such as distributed electric propulsion. These new concepts, architectures, and technologies pose an uncertainty related to risk associated with off-nominal operation due to limitations of traditional safety analysis applied to new technologies. Surveyed literature does not completely address the limitations caused by insufficient knowledge and experience with transformative technologies. The present work proposes an integrated safety assessment framework developed previously by the authors to evaluate off-nominal performance and reliability using information that is typically available in conceptual or preliminary design phases. A case study on the electric power architecture of a test distributed electric propulsion aircraft inspired by the NASA Maxwell X-57 Mod-IV is provided. A maximum potential flight-path angle metric and trimmability considerations using a six-degree-of-freedom model help determine hazard severity of power degradation scenarios. Bayesian failure rate posteriors are constructed for the different components in the traction power system, which are used in a Bayesian decision framework to make a compliance assessment.",59,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036338,"In this combined experimental and numerical study, the propeller–airframe aerodynamic interaction is characterized for an aircraft configuration with propellers mounted to the horizontal tailplane. The contributions of the propeller and airframe to the overall loading are distinguished in the experimental analyses by using a combination of external balance and internal load cell data. Validated computational fluid dynamics simulations are then employed to quantify the interaction at a component level. The results show that the propeller installation shifts the neutral point aft with increasing propeller thrust. For the configuration considered herein, the yawing moment due to sideslip is increased by approximately 10%, independent of the propeller thrust coefficient. The changes in propeller loading due to the airframe-induced flowfield are the dominant factor to change the airframe stability and performance. The prominent installation effects occur at high angle of attack, because in that condition the propeller experiences a significant nonuniform inflow that affects the propeller and tailplane. The relatively large propeller diameter compared with tailplane span leads to a change of the tailplane root vortex that causes the tailplane effectiveness to reduce with an inboard-up rotating propeller.",59,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036339,"Formation flying techniques, demonstrated by migratory birds, have the potential to significantly save energy when two or more transport aircraft fly the same route at the same time. In fuel-saving formations, aircraft are flying straight trajectories for most of the time. For proof of concept, however, how vertical and lateral maneuvers can be flown has to be investigated. Those investigations require a flight simulator that is equipped with adequate flight mechanical models. Not much research exists on maneuvers of formation. The paper addresses the components that are needed to perform this research with real-time flight simulations. They are, first, a method to model wake vortices on curved trajectories; second, a formation flight control system, which comprises a method for the relative position determination, the design of control laws, and suitable cockpit displays; and third, techniques that allow vertical and lateral flight maneuvers. Two different strategies to position the following aircraft relative to the wake vortex during turns are described, and simulation results show their differences in terms of fuel savings and passenger comfort. Piloted flight simulator tests confirmed the usability of the proposed flight techniques for formation maneuvers, and the participating airline pilots indicated general consent to the concept.",59,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036409,"A method for estimating the drag reduction performance of riblets installed on the surfaces of an aircraft was extended to take the effect of the pressure gradient over the aircraft into account. This method simply and roughly estimates the effectiveness of riblets applied to arbitrary surfaces of any aircraft by fusing wind tunnel test data and computational fluid dynamics analysis. The drag reduction rate is calculated from the relationships between friction drag reduction , wall-normalized riblet spacing , and Clauser pressure gradient parameter . To obtain this relationship, a wind tunnel test with straight riblets in an adverse pressure gradient was carried out. The resulting shift in the value in the intercept of the log-law region of the mean velocity profile for riblet cases indicates that the drag reduction effect decreases as the Clauser parameter increases. Based on these results, an approximate surface for the relationship between , , and was proposed, and the drag reduction performance of riblets installed on the surfaces of a conceptual aircraft was estimated. The total drag reduction rates estimated by the extended method considering pressure gradient effects and the original method case were both about 2%, which indicates that the effects of the pressure gradient on the aircraft on overall riblet performance are small.",59,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036426,"Active flow control has not found wide application in aircraft due to a combination of technical challenges, costs, and small impact on overall aircraft performance. Future applications, like alleviating dynamic loads, could be made possible through continuous improvement of flow control methods and increasingly restrictive environmental regulations. To date, few studies deal with active flow control for load alleviation on transport aircraft wings at high Reynolds and Mach numbers. A systematic assessment of flow control methods for load alleviation is therefore carried out. Multiple flow actuation schemes for gust load alleviation through dynamic lift reduction are investigated over a range of flight conditions using two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Unsteady gust interactions with a clean airfoil produce target loads for load alleviation. Actuator performance is consequently evaluated based on an engineering model. The results show that select fluidic actuators outperform micro-mechanical actuators at low flight speeds and feature similar steady load response as trailing edge flaps for the entire flight envelope. The Coandă jet features relatively low mass flow requirements, but necessitates minimal dual-slot blowing for baseline performance recovery. The results of this study highlight the potential of fluidic flow control schemes for implementation into a dedicated gust load alleviation system.",59,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036490,"This work presents the effect of wingtip-mounted propellers on the aircraft drag polar, identified from in-flight measurements. In previous wind-tunnel experiments, significant reductions in drag and an increase in propulsive efficiency through interaction between induced flow by the wingtip-mounted propellers and the flowfield of the wing itself have been claimed. So far, however, these effects have never been verified in actual flight. That gap is closed here by presenting the results of in-flight measurements. A 33.3% scaled version of the manned, electric e-Genius aircraft has been fitted with a wingtip propulsion system and an elaborate measurement system, which allows quantifying the aforementioned effects. The drag polar is deduced through weighted least-squares parameter estimation for different settings and configurations of the wingtip propellers. The findings are compared to results from previous wind-tunnel experiments. The paper further discusses secondary effects that were observed during the flight tests and their influence on the general potential of wingtip propulsion.",59,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035861,"Traditionally, the design of propellers is accomplished on the bases of engineering experience and the availability of well-established experimental data. However, the emergence of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools coupled with advanced optimizers has made this task easier. This paper presents the essentials of an optimization-based CFD chain aimed at finding the optimal operating parameters and blade settings of a high-speed propeller. This fully automated procedure combines an improved hypercube sampling (IHS) for the initial design of experiment and a radial basis function (RBF) as the meta-model, hence leading to lesser CFD simulations. The coupling between IHS and RBF is judiciously implemented, and the sampling strategy and updates are thoroughly examined. The optimization procedure uses the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm nondominated sorting genetic algorithm to determine the operating parameters and blade setting that maximize the propeller efficiency and thrust. At the optimum point the blade operates with mild pressure gradients, whereas the transonic region is restricted to the upper corner of the blade tip.",59,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036481,"Fiber steering leads to gaps and overlaps in plies and laminates. The position of these gaps and overlaps as well as their total volume/area is very much influenced by the seeding strategy when transforming from a theoretical to a manufacturing design. The theoretical designs obtained from a steered fiber laminate optimization routine are the starting point of a tow path planning step. The seed points together with the theoretical fiber angle determine the path of a tow. Normally, seed points are determined by a manufacturing engineer. In this paper, two different strategies to automate the selection of initial seed points and subsequent points based on the calculation of previous tow paths are proposed and evaluated. For two-dimensional plate problems both proposed methods reduce the gaps and overlaps. The method based on the median tow path is spreading gaps and overlaps more uniformly and yields fewer gaps and overlaps. A cut and restart procedure is discussed and implemented, which can be used to manually or automatically prevent/limit overlaps and fill large gaps.",59,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036112,"The effects of wake crossing at any horizontal angle, airspeed, and altitude are considered, focusing on crossing at cruise speeds at altitudes close to the tropopause. The roll effect is considered in two cases: 1) specification of the aileron deflection as a function of time that exactly compensates for the rolling moment induced on the crossing aircraft by the wake of the leading aircraft so that the crossing aircraft is undisturbed; and 2) in the case when the available roll control power is not sufficient to compensate completely for the wake induced rolling moment, the resulting roll rate and bank angle of the crossing aircraft are calculated as a function of time. The distinction between the two cases is made by a safe separating distance or safe separating time: beyond which, roll compensation 1) is possible; and below which, rolling motion 2) is unavoidable. Besides the roll acceleration, roll rate, and bank angle for the roll axis, the effects of wake crossing are also considered for the vertical axis, including the load factor, vertical velocity, and altitude change. The theory applies to any pair of aircraft and indicates the dependence on aircraft parameters, flight, and atmospheric conditions.",59,2
