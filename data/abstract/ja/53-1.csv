2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033159,"The conceptual design of a low-boom and low-drag supersonic aircraft remains a challenge despite significant progress in recent years. Inverse design using reversed equivalent area and adjoint methods has been demonstrated to be effective in shaping the ground signature propagated from computational fluid dynamics off-body-pressure distributions. However, there is still a need to reduce the computational cost in the early stages of design to obtain a baseline that is feasible for low-boom shaping, and in the search for a robust low-boom design over the entire sonic-boom footprint. The proposed design method addresses the need to reduce the computational cost for robust low-boom design by using surface-pressure distributions from computational fluid dynamics solutions to shape sonic-boom ground signatures propagated from computational fluid dynamics off-body pressure.",53,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033171,"A systematic approach for aeroelastic scaled-model design is developed. The method optimizes an incremental number of vibration eigenpairs, buckling eigenpairs, and optionally a linear static response of scaled models to match the scaled values of a target full-scale aircraft. A method for matching scaled modal mass, a required scaling parameter, is developed. The sources of local optima are identified and a tiered global-search-optimization procedure is incorporated. The approach is demonstrated on a joined-wing scaled-model-design problem. Costly nonlinear analysis is omitted from the evaluation of the objective function and constraints for optimization. The results produced scaled models that closely replicate the geometrically nonlinear target aeroelastic behavior.",53,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033175,"An indispensable tool for the development of a carrier landing control system is the linearized kinetics model of carrier-based aircraft, which is required to accurately describe aircraft air turbulence responses because the approach-path turbulent atmosphere is the major source of glidepath and touchdown errors. The conventional method of longitudinal linear modeling fails to correctly emulate aircraft groundspeed variations during final carrier approach. Considering the fact that control requirements related to the velocity are stringent, an improved linearization method is proposed. It compensates the cross-disturbance effects of wind gust horizontal and vertical components on airspeed and angle of attack, besides requantifying the induced force transient along the flight path. This technique, as applied to an example carrier-based aircraft model, leads to a linearized final-approach kinetics model with a significantly enhanced capability on analyzing aircraft groundspeed deviation in the carrier air-wake field, compared with the linear model derived from the traditional way. In the simulated terminal carrier approach flight with an open-loop autonomous landing system and severe ship burble engaged, the disturbed groundspeed exhibited by the improved linear model is identical to the nonlinear model response in trend, with the error discernible after 7 s but constrained within .",53,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033154,"There has been a recent interest to explore the shape and kinematics parameters of distinct pterosaurs from their fossil records. Clearly, far more evidence is needed to understand the nuances of dinosaurs flight. A multiobjective aerodynamic optimization problem of the wing kinematics and planform of a pterosaur replica ornithopter designed by Aerovironment is performed. Objective functions include minimization of the required cycle-averaged aerodynamic power and maximization of the propulsive efficiency. It is found that inclusion of the inertial power requirements is necessary for a physical and proper formulation of the optimization problem. Furthermore, the mere addition of the inertial power requirements is not enough to obtain reasonable results. Rather, one has to consider a partial (or even zero) elastic energy storage. The minimum power kinematic parameters closely match those of the previously designed pterosaur replica. Nevertheless, the obtained efficiency for such a design (minimum power) is 10%, which is considerably lower than the maximum possible efficiency for the used planform (40%). Furthermore, the optimized planform for maximum efficiency of the pterosaur yields to an increase in the propulsive efficiency by 6%.",53,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033184,"Conventional trim optimization problem formulations can produce poor results for vehicles with redundant multi-axis control surfaces. Trimming these vehicles requires solving the nonlinear equations of motion for their roots or equilibrium points. The hybrid wing–body vehicle has many redundant elevons and tends to result in an underdetermined system. As a consequence, there may be an infinite number of deflection combinations that satisfy the same moments. Challenges associated with using conventional trim optimizations with this type of vehicle are demonstrated, followed by two alternative approaches to relieve these problems. Control allocation techniques are integrated into the conventional approach to reduce the number of variables and attempt to make the problem more convex. A reformulation of the trim optimization from root seeking to drag minimization was also explored. These alternative methods were judged on how often they converged, trimmed drag and thrust, and commanded deflections.",53,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033183,"A novel, tiltrotor, unmanned aerial vehicle configuration has been designed, and a preliminary dynamic model has been created for control design purposes based on a component buildup approach. This method has been preferred over a conventional stability derivative approach because it models the nonlinear aircraft dynamics in the entire flight envelope, ranging from hover to forward-flight conditions at any airflow angles. The flight control system has then been synthesized based on an incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion technique. The incremental strategy was adopted to solve the problem of the nonlinear dynamic model not being control affine due to effector redundancy, dramatic nonlinearities, and cross-coupling effects introduced by the use of thrust vectoring during hover and transition phases. Local control derivatives were calculated online from the dynamic model. Effector redundancy was managed, developing a control allocation module for distributing the control effort according to a daisy-chaining logic and according to the actuator availability and effectiveness. The timescale separation principle was applied, dividing control laws into two loops: an outer loop controlling slower dynamics, and outputting virtual controls for an inner loop controlling faster dynamics. Different piloting logics were identified for hover and forward-flight conditions, although the largest possible degree of commonality was sought. A command blending strategy was devised to control the aircraft during transition phases. Simulations confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed solutions, showing satisfactory tracking of reference inputs with moderate control effort.",53,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033194,"Coupled computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics (RCAS/HELIOS and CAMRAD II/HELIOS) analyses are performed, and the calculated rotor structural loads are compared with the flight-test data obtained from the NASA/Army UH-60A Airloads Program. Three challenging level-flight conditions are investigated: 1) high speed with advancing blade negative lift, 2) low speed with blade/wake interaction, and 3) high thrust with dynamic stall. The predicted flap bending and torsion moments, pitch link, and lag damper loads, in general, show reasonably good correlation with the test data. A nonlinear lag damper model is essential for the accurate prediction of root chord bending moment and lag damper load. Both analyses, however, significantly underpredict the chord bending moments, especially the harmonic amplitude. Parametric study shows that blade stiffness variations have only a small influence on the load calculations. However, modal damping in the first flap mode has a significant influence on the flap bending moments.",53,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033212,"To simulate three-dimensional glaze ice accretion on a typical aircraft surface, the model of water film flow and ice accretion on a curved surface based on two coupled partial differential equations proposed by Myers et al. is extended in nonorthogonal curvilinear coordinates. Then, the governing equation for water film flow coupling with a Stefan model for glaze icing is built up. An efficient implicit–explicit numerical method is proposed for solving the governing equations. The glaze ice computations on two-dimensional airfoils and three-dimensional typical geometries in in-flight icing conditions are completely accomplished. Validation results of two-dimensional calculation cases with experimental ice shapes are presented. Three-dimensional simulations of glaze ice accretion on a sphere and a swept wing are successfully carried out and compared with ice profiles from icing tunnel tests and simulations based on the classical Messinger model.",53,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033223,"A series of model-scale tests were recently completed using the open-rotor propulsion rig at the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field in an effort to characterize the aeroacoustic performance of several open-rotor-propulsor designs. These included the historical-baseline and second-generation blade sets. Subsequently, the second generation design was assessed to have significant cumulative margins relative to the International Civil Aviation Organization Chapter 4 noise regulations, whilst the historical blade set had a negative margin. However, integrated metrics, like effective perceived-noise level, are not intuitive to the layperson, and likely do not convey the noise benefits over earlier designs, for example, the acoustically unique unducted-fan demonstrator of the 1980s. This paper develops the means of auralizing flyover-noise projections of full scale open-rotor engines using model-scale data in a manner that more readily communicates the noise benefit, and that is consistent with previously published aircraft-system-noise assessments. The effects of thrust level, installation type, and rotor-inflow angle on the generated flyover noise are investigated for the historical-baseline blade set. Finally, the benefits of the modern open-rotor blade design are made apparent through comparison of flyover noise from the second-generation and historical-baseline blade sets.",53,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033220,"The effectiveness of the riblets, one of the most interesting drag-reduction device, is discussed in this paper. Numerical simulations by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with the riblets properly taken into account are presented. Riblets are modeled as a singular roughness problem by modifying the classical Wilcox boundary condition for rough walls. The boundary condition is able to predict the flow features in the low roughness range (transitional roughness) where riblets operate. A brief discussion of the simulations performed to validate the model is first presented. Then, a complex wing–body configuration is analyzed, and the overall effect of riblets on the aerodynamic coefficients is evaluated. Calculations of a complete aircraft configuration at transonic conditions show how a proper optimized choice of the riblet height can significantly improve the drag reduction.",53,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033236,"A coupled computational fluid dynamics and computational structural dynamics methodology is developed to analyze the effects of a leading-edge slat on rotor performance. The multielement intermesh connectivity was handled by implicit hole cutting overset implementation. The three-dimensional coupled computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics model is extensively validated against a UH-60 flight-test condition: C9017. The solver is then used to successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of a leading-edge slat in mitigating (or eliminating) dynamic lift and moment stall on a modified UH-60A blade with a 40%-span slatted airfoil section. This results in a reduction of torsional structural loads (up to 73%) and pitch link loads (up to 62%) as compared to the baseline C9017 values. A dynamically moving slat strategy, actuating between slat positions S-1 and S-6 with 1 per revolution harmonic, is considered for stall mitigation. Further, it is shown that using slats with up to 10% higher thrust beyond the limit imposed by McHugh’s stall boundary (C9017) can be achieved. Stall mitigation due to the slat results in a reduction of torsional load up to 54% and a reduction of pitch link load up to 32% as compared to the baseline C9017 flight-test values, even for an increase in thrust of 10%.",53,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033237,"The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of insect contamination on operational and economic effectiveness of an aircraft with natural laminar flow wings designed by DLR. It is intended to show how insect debris located close to the wing leading edge influence fuel consumption on single missions as well as economic metrics like net present value. The focus will be on short-to-medium haul operations, i.e., aircraft similar to current state-of-the-art 150 passenger seated aircraft. During the analysis process tools for aircraft design, mission simulation and computation, insect contamination as well as life-cycle cost assessment will be used. The overall goal is to provide aircraft operators with a better understanding of the operational behavior of natural laminar flow aircraft under realistic operational boundary conditions and related economic implications.",53,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033253,"This paper presents a multiscale finite-element formulation for the second mode of zonal detached-eddy simulation. The multiscale formulation corrects the lack of stability of the standard Galerkin formulation by incorporating the effect of unresolved scales to the grid (resolved) scales. The stabilization terms arise naturally and are free of user-defined stability parameters. Validation of the method is accomplished via the turbulent flow over tandem cylinders. The boundary-layer separation, free shear-layer rollup, vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder, and interaction with the downstream cylinder are well reproduced. Good agreement with experimental measurements gives credence to the accuracy of zonal detached-eddy simulation in modeling turbulent separated flows. A comprehensive study is then conducted on the performance degradation of ice-contaminated airfoils. NACA 23012 airfoil with a spanwise ice ridge and Gates Learjet Corporation-305 airfoil with a leading-edge horn-shape glaze ice are selected for investigation. Appropriate spanwise domain size and sufficient grid density are determined to enhance the reliability of the simulations. A comparison of lift coefficient and flowfield variables demonstrates the added advantage that the zonal detached-eddy simulation model brings to the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. Spectral analysis and instantaneous visualization of turbulent structures are also highlighted via zonal detached-eddy simulation.",53,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033276,"The meshless method of smooth particle hydrodynamics is used to simulate the water spray caused by a rolling airplane tire, which is a complex physical problem. Graphics of the spray at a certain tire speed and water film thickness are given to describe the whole process in detail. Flowfields at different tire speeds demonstrate that, as the tire speed increases, splashes as well as the scroll effect of the rolling movement become more pronounced. Furthermore, the angles between the runway and main jet flowfields at both sides increase. Results are also presented on splashes through the water film with different thicknesses. In this paper, for the first time in literature, detailed results of the whole water spray process are given and the effects of tire speed and water film thickness on water spray are quantified.",53,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033294,"The improvement of slatless high-lift configurations is of high importance for future aircraft. This statement is valid for turbulent wing as well as wing integrating laminar flow technologies. Such performance improvement can be obtained by using active flow control at the main wing leading edge, or by the use of passive devices (vortex generators) or active devices (blowing slot) located on the flap, in order to suppress the flow separation that generally exists at the flap trailing edge for lift-optimized landing configurations. This paper presents the numerical optimization of a flap system equipped, or not equipped, with mechanical vortex generators, including the flap settings and the vortex generator characteristics. The flap settings (gap, overlap, and angle) and the mechanical vortex generator parameters (location, height, skew angle, spacing and length), are optimized at the same time.",53,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033301,"This research evaluated various methods using ZONA’s Euler Unsteady Aerodynamic Solver against flight tests previously flown at USAF Test Pilot School, using underwing air-to-air missiles with removable canards, which allows the aerodynamics of the store configuration to be changed while maintaining identical mass properties. ZONA’s Euler Unsteady Aerodynamic Solver was employed with various linear flutter and nonlinear time-domain analyses. ZONA’s Euler Unsteady Aerodynamic Solver correctly predicted that removing the canards would delay limit cycle oscillation onset. However, all of the methods generally predicted onset earlier than flight test. Consistent with the results found by previous researchers, the nonlinear simulation still predicted divergent classical flutter rather than limit cycle oscillation until nonlinear structural damping was added and tuned to produce limit cycle oscillation. Without known structural damping characteristics, the nonlinear structural damping model needed to be arbitrarily tuned to match flight-test data. This research demonstrated a different tuning method from that had been used by previous researchers. Nonlinear structural damping plays an important role in limit cycle oscillation, but a better understanding of the actual nonlinear aerodynamic and structural effects is needed before reliable limit cycle oscillation predictions can be made for all configurations and throughout the flight envelope.",53,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033305,"The aerodynamic response to sideslip is crucial for an aircraft’s lateral stability, especially for configurations incorporating vortex flow, on which sideslip causes asymmetric vortex behavior and brings extra complexity. In this work, vortex flow over a close-coupled canard configuration under sideslip is simulated using delayed detached-eddy simulation, with the angle of attack varying up to the poststall regime. Sideslip-induced distinctions in both vortex dynamics and canard/wing-vortex interaction are analyzed to explain the nonlinear response of the configuration. The results reveal that the effect of sideslip differs significantly upon different angle-of-attack regimes. At a medium angle of attack, the spanwise extension of the low-pressure area due to windward vortex core expansion results in superior windward lift against the leeward side, but the relatively low pressure retained due to delay of the leeward vortex breakdown is the main motivation that leeward lift surpasses windward at a high angle of attack. The canard vortex trajectory deflected under sideslip induces asymmetric vortex interaction, enhancing the leeward side, which not only leads to an unusual rolling moment toward the higher lift side at a medium angle of attack but also causes an abrupt loss of lateral stability at the poststall angle of attack. A featured demarcation line exists on both the canard and the wing to separate the lift imbalance area, which is found useful in interpreting the nonlinear behavior.",53,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033304,"Circulation control airfoils modify the lift by changing the jet momentum (injected tangent to a blunt trailing edge), whereas conventional sharp trailing-edge airfoils control their lift primarily by changing the angle of attack. For a step input in the angle of attack, the lift develops with a certain indicial time lag, which for sharp trailing-edge airfoils may be represented by Wagner’s function. This paper explores the similarities between Wagner’s lift build-up function and lift build-up over elliptical circulation control airfoils using numerical simulations for a 15% thickness-to-chord ratio elliptic circulation control airfoil. Following a thorough validation, the lift response to a step change in jet momentum is simulated using time-accurate flow simulations. The results highlight an excellent correlation between the time lags of the Wagner function and the circulation control airfoil lift response to the corresponding step input, suggesting that the Wagner function may lend itself for representing circulation control lift dynamics. Additional transient behaviors are also compared, and similarities as well as ranges of applicability are discussed.",53,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033315,"A well-known F-16 external store configuration was studied using a time-domain computational aeroelasticity code. The code used a medium-fidelity Euler flow solver coupled with a linear modal representation of the structure. A key feature of the code was that it allowed the user to specify nonlinear damping profiles. Four damping profiles were investigated to determine their effects on the efficacy of this approach for predicting aeroelastic limit-cycle oscillations. Damping was specified as a function of the oscillation response, and the solution results were compared to flight test responses as a function of Mach number. Realistic limit-cycle oscillation behaviors were obtained for three of the damping profiles investigated. The oscillation amplitude trends from the analysis compared favorably to the flight tests across a wide range of sub- and transonic Mach numbers. The development of the responses from initial excitation to fully developed limit-cycle oscillations varied appropriately for the different flight conditions examined. It was observed that small variations in the damping profiles for oscillation responses below appreciably altered the predicted limit-cycle oscillation amplitude. Variations in the damping profiles for oscillation responses above were seen to alter the simulation time required to reach fully developed limit-cycle oscillations, but these variations did not significantly affect the peak oscillation amplitudes.",53,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033309,"Aircraft performances at landing or takeoff depend strongly on runway surface conditions. There is a need to provide aircraft pilots with reliable information in view of determining landing performance. Currently, this information is based on a description of the type and depth of contaminants on the runway surface. This paper presents a new method to improve the correlation between friction coefficients and braking coefficients measured respectively by ground vehicles and aircraft. A three-step approach is proposed, using a friction model developed by the Engineering Sciences Data Unit (ESDU), to weight the measured coefficients by factors taking into account the characteristics of the devices and the contaminants. The friction ESDU model is used on contaminated surfaces. The methodology is applied to data collected from extensive friction tests conducted between 1996 and 2003 (in the Joint Winter Runaway Friction Measurement Program). Characteristics of ground friction measuring devices and aircraft are provided as inputs for the ESDU model. It was found that the correlation between weighted ground friction and braking coefficients is improved significantly compared with the correlation between unweighted coefficients. Advantages of the newly proposed method are discussed in terms of using ground friction coefficients as a promising alternative to determine the runway condition code for aircraft pilots.",53,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033322,"First, an overview of the design and construction of a th Froude-scaled flap-articulated rotor system that is immersed in a ship airwake flowfield is presented. Experimental challenges that were identified during and following the use of this system in an experimental study and their impact on the data are discussed. The experimental rotor system is presented as a useful testbed for theories and models of flexible multibody systems with gyrating beams undergoing large deformations. Second, the flap-articulated Froude-scaled experimental rotor system is tested in a scaled ship airwake environment using the National Research Council wind tunnel. Based on experimental and simulation data, conclusions are drawn regarding the influence of the aerodynamic environment and the rotor operation parameters on the rotor blade elastic deflections during the engagement/disengagement phase. It is concluded that the parameters of the engagement/disengagement profile play a minimal role in the occurrence of large elastic deflections, known as the blade sailing phenomenon. Increasing or decreasing the collective pitch setting along with increasing the wind speed and ship deck roll angle is found to amplify the blade sailing phenomenon. Additionally, it is further verified that, compared to an unsteady aerodynamic model, the nonlinear quasi-steady aerodynamic model with Mach number effects on the stall point is sufficient for blade sailing studies; however, the former is shown to be more accurate, particularly at higher wind speeds. The experimental data are also used to successfully validate developed multibody dynamics tools.",53,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033328,"Wing shape is one of the main drivers of aircraft aerodynamic performance, so most aerodynamic shape optimization efforts have focused solely on the wing. However, the performance of the full aircraft configuration must account for the fact that the aircraft needs to be trimmed. Thus, to realize the full benefit of aerodynamic shape optimization, one should optimize the wing shape while including the full configuration and a trim constraint. To evaluate the benefit of this approach, we perform the aerodynamic shape optimization of the Common Research Model wing–body–tail configuration using gradient-based optimization with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model that includes a discrete adjoint implementation. We investigate the aerodynamic shape optimization of the wing with a trim constraint that is satisfied by rotating the horizontal tail. We then optimize the same wing–body configuration without the tail but with an added trim drag penalty based on a surrogate model we created before the optimization. The drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift and trim constraints. We found that considering the trim during optimization is a better approach than using a fixed-wing moment constraint. We also show that the trim drag surrogate model we created yields a minimum drag coefficient that is within 1.2 counts of the minimum drag coefficient obtained by rotating the tail to satisfy the trim constraint. However, we recommend rotating the tail within the optimization process to obtain the best possible performance.",53,1
