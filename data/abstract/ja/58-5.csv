0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036044,"In this paper, the validity of the thin-airfoil-theory-based source term modeling, Bender–Anderson–Yagle (BAY) model, for predicting the flows induced by a range of different vane-type vortex generators (VGs) is analyzed. By directly comparing the BAY model computations with the body-fitted VG computations using the same grids, the modeling errors involved in the BAY model are elucidated. The results indicate the validity of the thin-airfoil-theory-based modeling employed in the BAY model for predicting the flows induced by typical vane-type VGs. Based on the validity of the modeling, then, the errors introduced by grid-selection methods for the use of the BAY model on non-body-conforming grids are addressed, which leads to a proposed simple grid-selection method for the BAY model on non-body-conforming grids. The proposed grid-selection method improves the robustness and accuracy for predicting the flows induced by various vane-type VG geometries on non-body-conforming grids.",58,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036177,The modeling and assessment of the community noise impacts of a representative hybrid-electric aircraft implementing windmilling motors as drag generators on approach is presented. An increasing desire to reduce emissions caused by aviation has motivated the development of hybrid-electric aircraft that have some degree of their traditional gas-turbine propulsion replaced with electric propulsion. Turboelectric propulsion offers flexibility in the engine architecture that allows hybrid-electric aircraft to be capable of certain advanced operational noise abatement flight procedures. Steep and delayed-configuration approaches are example flight procedures that enable significant noise reductions on approach but require the aircraft to have enough drag for the approach to be stable. Windmilling is an alternative mechanism to create drag during descent and is possible in architectures where the fan is powered by an electric motor. Results examining the potential benefits of representative turboelectric aircraft implementing this controlled drag concept on both delayed deceleration and steeper approaches are presented. The results indicate that windmilling fans are quieter than standard drag-producing devices and can be used to yield significant community noise reductions compared to aircraft performing standard 3 deg continuous descent approaches.,58,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035941,"Unlike a single-body approach, modeling based on a two-body approach has been employed to prepare the required system dynamic model as a time update equation in the applied filtering technology and measurement data for the estimation process. This more precise mathematical model enabled better understanding about the dynamics of the change in the aircraft mass properties during the airdropping operation. The problem is defined as estimation of the optimal mass properties parameters for the best possible fit of the model output to the real data. The parameter estimation problem is investigated by a nonlinear filtering methodology in two sequential steps. In the first step, the single extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the aircraft total mass and moment of inertia before entering an airdrop maneuver. In the second step, both the aircraft dynamic states and mass parameters are estimated during an airdrop maneuver using a joint extended Kalman filter. Monte Carlo simulations have then been performed to assess the performance of the algorithm in the presence of measurement errors and model uncertainties. The results indicate that time-varying aircraft mass properties estimation, as a technological requirement for the aircraft adaptive flight control system to reduce the risks involved with the airdrop operation, is satisfactorily possible.",58,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036163,"The influence of the lift-share ratio between a rotor and a wing on the aerodynamic performance of a winged compound helicopter in high advance ratio flight is investigated through numerical simulations in this paper. A simplified model constructed with only a rotor and a winged body is considered to focus on the aerodynamic interactions between the rotor and the wing. The effect of the interaction is evaluated through comparison to the isolated rotor and the isolated wing in the same flight condition. A cruising flight condition at which the rotor advance ratio is about 0.7 is considered where the rotor rotational speed is reduced to 75% revolutions per minute. The lift-share ratio between the rotor and the wing is changed by adjusting the wing incidence angle and the wing area. Numerical simulation results show that the aerodynamic performances against the lift-share ratio follow similar trends regardless of the wing incidence change or the wing area change. The lift-to-drag ratios of the rotor and the winged body both degrade due to the aerodynamic interaction between the rotor and the winged body as compared with the isolated configurations. The optimal lift-share ratio of the rotor is about 6–7% of the total lift. When the lift share of the rotor is larger than the optimal value, the overall performance is drastically reduced by the rotor/wing aerodynamic interaction.",58,5

One solution to this problem is the use of a trajectory control system to control the ground track of the balloon. To assess the performance of one such trajectory control system in a real wind field, a small-scale sail was designed and built to fly beneath a moored balloon. Three test phases of rudder deflection were used to demonstrate the effect of the sail guiding force on the balloon, and the sail demonstrated the ability to move the balloon laterally due to a change in rudder deflection. A theoretical model of the system was found to qualitatively agree with the experimental values of sail displacement and mooring tether tension. At a high level, these results demonstrate that a tether-and-sail system shows promise as a trajectory control system for scientific balloons.",58,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035933,"A classical flow-vane approach for reconstructing translational gust velocities from air data and inertial sensor measurements was improved and implemented for real-time computation. The reconstructed turbulence measurements were then included in a system identification analysis to estimate nondimensional stability and control derivatives in a longitudinal short period model using the maximum likelihood equation-error method in the frequency domain with Fourier-transform data. Flight-test results using 44 maneuvers from a subscale transport-type airplane showed that the power spectra for the reconstructed vertical gusts resembled standard Dryden or von Kármán turbulence models. Flight data in moderate and severe turbulence exhibited a decorrelation of the modeling data. In particular, pitch rate and angle-of-attack rate derivatives could both be identified from flight data about straight and level flight without special maneuvers or prior information.",58,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036070,"Mechanical instabilities and elastic nonlinearities are emerging means for designing deployable and shape adaptive structures. Dynamic snap-through buckling is investigated here as a means to tailor the deployment and retraction of a slat-cove filler (SCF), a morphing component used to reduce airframe noise. Upon deployment, leading-edge slats create a cove between themselves and the main wing, producing unsteady flow features that are a significant source of airframe noise. A SCF is designed here to autonomously snap out as the slat deploys, providing a smoother aerodynamic profile that reduces flow unsteadiness. The nonlinear structural behavior of the SCF is studied, and then tailored, to achieve a desirable snapping response. Three SCF configurations are considered: 1) a constant thickness (monolithic) superelastic shape-memory alloy (SMA) SCF, 2) a variable-thickness SMA SCF, and 3) a set of stiffness-tailored fiberglass composite SCFs. Results indicate that, although monolithic SMA SCFs provide a simple solution, thickness variations in both the SMA and stiffness-tailored composite SCF designs allow a decrease of the energy required for self-deployment and a reduction of the severity of the impact between the SCF and the slat during stowage. The enhanced nonlinear behavior from stiffness tailoring reduces peak material strains in comparison to previous SMA SCF designs that leveraged material superelasticity for shape adaptation. The stiffness tailoring is readily achieved through the use of layered composites, facilitating considerable weight savings compared to the dense SMA designs. The aeroelastic response of different SCFs is calculated using fluid/structure interaction analyses, and it is shown that both SMA and composite SCF designs can deploy and retract in full flow conditions.",58,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036043,"Ice accretion on a helicopter’s aerodynamic surfaces during flight can lead to incidents and fatal accidents. An iced helicopter blade results in a decrease in stall angle, an increase in required torque, as well as potential damage from shed ice. While the high centrifugal forces on a rotor may serve as a natural deicing mechanism, they can also lead to uneven ice shedding, causing rotor imbalances or hitting other blades, the fuselage, or the tail rotor. Computational methods are important for predicting in-flight ice formation and are a vital tool in the design of ice protection systems. The objective of this paper is to present a computationally inexpensive methodology to determine for a helicopter in forward flight, following a period of ice accretion, rotor ice crack locations, shedding times, and potential impact zones.",58,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036208,"In an effort to evaluate the accuracy of the finite-state dynamic inflow of Peters and He (“Finite State Induced Flow Models Part II: Three-Dimensional Rotor Disk,” Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 32, No. 2, 1995, pp. 323–333) for use in rotor design, comparisons between dynamic inflow-based calculations and measured test data are presented for a wide variety of single rotor configurations and operating conditions. The quantities compared include rotor performance parameters, blade flap bending moments, blade airloads, and blade pitch angles. The dynamic inflow calculations are performed using the U.S. Army’s Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis System. Rotor performance calculations are mostly accurate prior to stall, except for rotor torque calculations from an individual blade pitch control phase sweep. Blade airloads calculations do exhibit the correct dominant features, including those from blade tip vortices, but the calculated amplitudes of the wake-induced loading are significantly less than the test data; this leads to significantly lower amplitudes in the flap bending moment response and is problematic for calculating half peak-to-peak values in conditions with significant blade–wake interactions. Blade collective and cyclic pitch angles are reasonably accurate in edgewise flight.",58,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036275,"In conventional aircraft design, engine loads are transferred directly from the engine core and fan case to the pylon via engine mounts. Literature is available on the modeling of individual powerplant components, but limited work is available on the whole assembled system (engine, pylon, and nacelle). The influence of the structural connections between the components on overall system performance has not been investigated. Herein, a finite element model is described and can be used to assess connection strategies between powerplant components and if such arrangements can effectively enhance engine performance by reducing detrimental engine structural deformations (engine carcass bending, rotation, and ovalization). The method is demonstrated for a generic high bypass ratio engine design, focusing on connections between the engine and thrust reverser unit. The method identifies a modified attachment scheme between the engine rear turbine casing and the inner barrel of the thrust reverser unit, which reduces engine deformations across multiple loading scenarios. Maximum reductions of 97 and 96% have been observed in carcass bending and ovalization, respectively.",58,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036186,"The present study numerically explored the hydrodynamic characteristics of a helicopter model experiencing guided ditching on wavy water. The air–water two-phase flow was computed by solving unsteady incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations enclosed by the shear stress transport turbulence model. The effect of water-entry position of the wave, viz., crest, falling, rising and trough, on the ditching behavior of a helicopter was assessed under different initial pitching angles. Results show that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the helicopter ditching on wavy water is significantly different from ditching on still water. Ditching on the crest of a wave illustrates the best performance in terms of angular, vertical, and horizontal acceleration that results from a skiing motion to minimize the hydrodynamic overload. On the other hand, ditching on trough will result in the most severe overload because the largest impacting area of the helicopter provides a relatively large reactive force to decelerate the descending motion of the helicopter. Within the tested angles, ditching on crest is always the best option. The initial pitching angle is influential to the rising and trough cases, such that a smaller pitching angle is suggested for ditching a rising wave, and alternatively, a larger angle is suitable for trough.",58,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036259,"A vehicle-level noise assessment has been performed for the NASA D8 (ND8) concept aircraft in the NASA Advanced Air Transport Technology Project portfolio. The NASA research-level Aircraft Noise Prediction Program was used to predict the noise from each source component on the ND8 to build up a noise estimate for the full aircraft. The propulsion airframe aeroacoustic effects of the ND8 (namely, boundary-layer ingestion, with its influence on fan noise; and the noise shielding, reflection, and diffraction mechanisms of the unconventional airframe) were empirically modeled using experimental data. Far-term noise reduction technology concepts were modeled and added to the noise prediction to evaluate the low-noise potential of the ND8 in the far-term timeframe. Results indicate that the increase in fan noise due to boundary-layer ingestion, as well as the lack of aft shielding, prevents the aircraft from approaching NASA’s noise goals for either the midterm or far term. The aircraft achieves margins to Stage 4 of only 9.4 and 17.3 effective perceived noise in decibels (EPNdB) in the midterm and far-term configurations, respectively, compared with goals of 32–42 EPNdB in the midterm and 42-52 EPNdB in the far term.",58,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036207,"Active flow control (AFC) is conventionally used to reduce flow separation at high angles of attack. A novel alternative form of AFC for controlling rotor blade loads in attached flow is examined. The AFC system employs pulsed fluidic jets near the trailing edge of a VR-12 airfoil on the pressure side and suction side. Each jet has two operating modes: tangential blowing and normal blowing. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations are performed to characterize the unsteady aerodynamic phenomena induced by actuation at low and moderate angles of attack. The simulation approach is validated using data from recent low-speed wind-tunnel experiments. The normal blowing modes produce nearly symmetric changes in the lift and moment that are proportional to the relative jet strength. The tangential blowing modes have a minor effect on lift and moment but have a beneficial effect on drag. High-speed simulations, up to , are also performed to determine the effect of freestream Mach number on actuator performance. Finally, simulations representing rotor blade dynamics during vibrations are carried out to illustrate the effect of unsteadiness associated with blade motion. This is the first instance showing that AFC is a viable approach for potentially controlling rotor vibrations in attached flow.",58,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036233,"The work presented in this paper is a culmination of a multiyear joint experimental and computational effort to explore the feasibility of using active flow control (AFC) on a simple hinged flap system for recovering lift comparable to a conventional high-lift system consisting of Fowler flaps. The baseline configuration chosen for this work is the high-lift version of the NASA Common Research Model (CRM), which is a representative modern aircraft consisting of wing, fuselage, nacelle/pylon, slats, Fowler flaps, and slat and flap brackets. A simplified high-lift (SHL) system was created by replacing the Fowler flaps and flap brackets with a simple hinged flap system equipped with integrated modular AFC cartridges on the suction surface of the flap shoulder, and the resulting geometry is known as the CRM–SHL–AFC configuration. Parametric studies were conducted in the earlier phases of this effort to numerically evaluate and downselect the more efficient AFC designs for wind-tunnel tests. These simulations were performed with the PowerFLOW® code, which is a lattice-Boltzmann-based computational fluid dynamics code. Good agreement was reported in a previous paper between the numerical results and the experimental data for the lift characteristics of the CRM–SHL–AFC configuration as a function of actuation levels at the nominal landing conditions. The current effort is focused on demonstrating the applicability of the PowerFLOW code for predicting the aerodynamic performance of the conventional and the AFC-enabled simplified high-lift CRM configurations for a broad angle of attack range, including maximum lift conditions.",58,5

First, the mechanic parameters, geometric structure, loading method of different aircraft cabin door fabric rubber seals, and gas conditions are analyzed. Second, the modified gas leakage rate formula of fabric rubber seal within wide ranges of temperature and gas pressure is derived based on the previous gas leakage rate formula of fabric rubber seal and the gas leakage rate experimental results. Then, the gas leakage rate prediction method of multicontact sealing surfaces is established. Finally, the variation law of the aircraft gas leakage rate with the altitude are determined based on the configuration number of the aircraft fuselage doors and the finite element results of the aircraft door seals. The research results will provide reliable scientific guidance for the mechanical performance evaluation and sealing performance prediction of fabric rubber seals.",58,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036115,"A recent consideration in aircraft design is the use of folding wingtips, with the aim of enabling higher-aspect-ratio wings with less induced drag but also meeting airport gate limitations. A formulation is introduced to account for finite rotations of rigid folding wingtips attached through hinges on a flexible airframe structure including also aerodynamic follower forces for the folding wingtip components. This study investigates the effects of geometric nonlinearities on the quasi-steady aeroelastic response of floating wingtips. It is found that the wingtip response can vary significantly when geometric nonlinearities are accounted for; however, a small impact was observed on the main airframe structure.",58,5
