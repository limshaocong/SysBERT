Firstly, the class-function/shape-function transformation parameterization method is adopted to describe the airfoil profile with different geometrical parameters. Secondly, the sample points in the design space are selected using the optimal Latin hypercube design methodology. Thirdly, the actual aerodynamic performance of cycloidal propellers is simulated by using the time-dependent incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics method and the sliding-mesh technique, which are verified by validation cases on an oscillating NACA 0012 airfoil and the baseline cycloidal propeller. Then, to replace the time-consuming computational fluid dynamics solver, kriging surrogate models are established using the sample data. Finally, the genetic algorithm is adopted to determine the optimized airfoil in the design space based on the constructed kriging models. Optimization is conducted on a micro- four-bladed cycloidal propeller with the NACA 0015 airfoil, and the results show that the figure of merit of the cycloidal propeller is increased by 18.31% at the design rotation speed. Although the optimization is conducted only at the design rotation speed, an appreciable improvement of the figure of merit can be achieved for a wide range of rotation speeds.",54,4

A pole placement controller is implemented as the baseline controller to carry out a pulsed bank maneuver of 25 deg. The baseline controller is augmented with a adaptive controller to cancel out the matched and unmatched uncertainties. The sources of uncertainties are reduced and asymmetrical control surface deflections, aerodynamic and gravimetric uncertainties, and control surface failure. The pole placement controller for the lateral/directional dynamics is a single-input/single-output system. The differences in terms of performance and robustness between the baseline and the augmented controllers are presented. The baseline controller shows good tracking under nominal conditions. However, there is a degradation in its performance in the presence of uncertainties and failures. The improvement in performance offered by the adaptive controller is presented with the help of the tracking error norm . In the process of improving the performance of the baseline controller, an increase in the control surface metric and deflection for the augmented controller is observed. The time delay margin shows that the use of adaptive augmentation reduces the robustness of the baseline controller.",54,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033976,"The aerospace industry’s progressive transition toward More Electric subsystem architectures presents some unique challenges for the early design stages: in part, due to the unavailability of historical data and the presence of a large number of subsystem architecture possibilities. Such novel subsystem architectures, which may have a pronounced effect on aircraft performance, must therefore be considered earlier in the design process than conventional architectures have traditionally been. This paper demonstrates the integration of aircraft and engine sizing with explicit sizing and analysis of the subsystems, using models and methods that are suitable for the early design phases. The resulting Integrated Subsystem Sizing and Architecture Assessment Capability is used to investigate a subsystem architecture design space for three aircraft sizes. The assessment reveals a characteristic clustering of subsystem architectures driven by the design characteristics of a few subsystems. It also reveals subsystem design solution trends existing in the best-performing subsystem architectures for each aircraft size. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to determine the impact of uncertainties in the secondary power extraction penalties on the performance of an electrified subsystem architecture.",54,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034036,"Propulsion integration for low-boom supersonic aircraft requires careful inlet selection, placement, and tailoring to achieve acceptable propulsive and aerodynamic performance, without compromising vehicle sonic boom loudness levels. In this investigation, an inward-turning streamline-traced inlet and an axisymmetric spike inlet are designed and independently installed on a conceptual low-boom supersonic demonstrator aircraft. The airframe is preshaped to achieve a target ground undertrack perceived loudness of 76.4 dB at cruise using an adjoint-based design optimization process. Aircraft and inlet performance characteristics are obtained by solution of the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Isolated inlet cruise performance including total pressure recovery and distortion are computed and compared against installed inlet performance metrics. Vehicle near-field pressure signatures, along with under- and offtrack propagated loudness levels, are also reported. Results indicate the integrated axisymmetric spike design offers higher inlet pressure recovery, lower fan distortion, and reduced sonic boom. The vehicle with the streamline-traced inlet exhibits lower external wave drag, which translates to a higher lift-to-drag ratio and increased range capability.",54,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033952,"The NASA Common Research Model of an airliner was used for the evaluation of the effect of aeroelasticity on aerodynamic forces and local flowfield. A computational fluid dynamics analysis of the rigid model showed large differences between the computational and experimental data. It was observed that the model (in particular, the wing) deformation has a significant effect on the aerodynamic characteristics. Online mesh deformation on the basis of wing modal analysis was used to improve the accuracy of the computational results. Twenty modes in total were used during coupled simulations. The results from these simulations showed that adding the wing deformation into the computational fluid dynamics simulation improved the accuracy of obtained aerodynamic coefficients. The same methodology was applied to the full-model configuration considering the deformation of all parts of the model. The results from the computational fluid dynamics analyses with online mesh deformation of the semispan and full model are the focus of this paper.",54,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034020,"Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations were carried out on a pitching finite wing model using the finite volume solver DLR-TAU. The comparison with the experimental data reveals a good agreement, especially in the region of the first occurrence of stall. Discrepancies are observed in the blade tip region, where the flow in the numerical data shows a stronger separation along with larger hysteresis effects in contrast to the experiment. Additionally, the analysis of the flowfield reveals the existence of multiple dynamic stall cells over the span. The simulations with different pitching frequencies demonstrate a change in the topology of dynamic stall vortex formation in the spanwise direction. An investigation using turbulence transition modeling based on a approach demonstrated that small differences can be attributed to transition; nevertheless, these can give further insight into the physics of dynamic stall and improve the comparability with the experiment. A comparison with two-dimensional simulations shows strong similarities of the peak values in the sections where the vortex starts to evolve and, although the three-dimensional flow is strongly driven by spanwise flow, the impact on the aerodynamic loads is relatively low.",54,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033978,"This paper identifies exhaust heat characteristics depending on airfoil shapes at low Reynolds number to design a high-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle with a wing-surface heat exchanger. In the first step, computational fluid dynamics simulations are conducted for different airfoils, each of which exhausts heat from different regions on the upper surface, at different angles of attack. This parametric study reveals that early transition near the leading edge is favorable to improve heat-exhaust characteristics, although it may increase skin friction. In addition, heat exhaust should be conducted only in the region of turbulent boundary layer behind the transition point. From these results, the airfoil shape significantly affects the Nusselt-number distribution along the upper wing surface due to the change in the location of laminar–turbulent transition and turbulent boundary-layer separation. In the next step, multi-objective optimization of an airfoil shape, which balances aerodynamic performance and heat-exhaust performance, is carried out. The obtained nondominated solutions show the tradeoffs between aerodynamic performance and heat-exhaust performance. It was confirmed that heat-exhaust performance can be controlled by the location of the laminar–turbulent transition, and improved without sacrificing aerodynamic performance at the cruising condition.",54,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033987,This paper uses computational fluid dynamics to predict aerodynamic damping of airships or hybrid air vehicles. This class of aircraft is characterized by large lifting bodies combining buoyancy and circulatory lift. Damping is investigated via forced oscillations of the vehicle in pitch and yaw. The employed method is verified using data for lighter-than-air vehicles. The use of fins and stabilizers is found to be beneficial. The rear part of the body is dominated by separated flow that contains more frequencies than the forcing frequency imposed on the body. The final design is seen to be dynamically stable across a range of conditions for small pitch angles.,54,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034043,"Aircraft braking systems may be subjected to friction-induced vibrations, during which the brake is unstable and behaves as a source of mechanical vibrations. This is an issue for aircraft brake manufacturers because it may jeopardize structural integrity due to accelerated fatigue life or generate discomfort for the aircraft crew and passengers. Hence, there is a need for instability simulation and prediction methods that can be used as early as the design stage. At this stage, finite element models are available, but their sizes are prohibitive as far as vibration-level prediction is concerned, thus requiring model reduction. This paper presents a comparative study between several modal reduction methods, among them the well-known Craig–Bampton method. The reference model to be reduced is a full brake system finite element model. The system stability is assessed by means of the classical complex eigenvalue analysis. Convergence of the implemented reduction strategies is studied. Double modal synthesis is implemented, and an improved version is introduced. They appear to be efficient model reduction strategies for application to squeal prediction. By reducing all the system’s degrees of freedom on several sets of generalized coordinates, an excellent compromise between system size and precision can be found.",54,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033765,"This paper describes two approaches to the construction of reduced-order models from computational fluid dynamics to predict the gust response of airfoils and wings. The first is a linear reduced-order model constructed using the eigensystem realization algorithm from pulse responses, and the second approach modifies the linear reduced-order model using steady-state data to introduce some nonlinearity into the reduced-order model. Results are presented for the Future Fast Aeroelastic Simulation Technologies wing and the Future Fast Aeroelastic Simulation Technologies crank airfoil. These show that for gusts of large amplitude in the transonic regime the response exhibits nonlinearity due to shock motion. This nonlinearity is not captured well by linear reduced-order models; however, the nonlinear reduced-order model shows better agreement with the full nonlinear simulation results.",54,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034133,"Air travelers breathe a blend of recirculated cabin air and outside air known as bleed air that has been compressed by the aircraft’s engines. Occasionally, engine oil leaks into bleed air, resulting in various chemical contaminants entering the aircraft cabin. Determining the chemicals produced and the oil particle size distribution when bleed air becomes contaminated with engine oil is very important to evaluate potential adverse health effects and to design a sensing system to detect bleed-air contamination in real time. In this research, the type and concentration of different chemicals as well as the number and size distribution of particles were determined for various bleed-air temperatures and pressures generated by a bleed-air simulator. Different aldehydes were formed, and concentrations increased with increasing pressure (200–480 kPa) and temperature (185–310°C). However, at a pressure of 690 kPa, temperature had only minor effects. Carbon-monoxide concentration increased with both increasing pressure and temperature across all temperatures and pressures evaluated. The oil particles produced had their maximum size but minimum number concentration at the minimum bleed-air temperature evaluated, and they had their maximum number concentration in the size of roughly at the maximum temperature and pressure point.",54,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033960,"A reduced-order, unsteady aerodynamic model for deployable Gurney flaps is formulated based on indicial concepts. The model is developed in the time domain to ensure applicability to arbitrary deployments. It takes into account compressibility effects as well as the nonlinear aerodynamic effectiveness of Gurney flaps with respect to their height. The model can be used to predict the aerodynamics of Gurney flaps that are positioned either upstream or at the trailing edge of the airfoil. Upstream Gurney flaps have been shown to be more complex to model because of the formation and convection of lower-surface vortices following their deployment. These vortical disturbances can introduce nonharmonic components in the aerodynamic response, substantially affecting the loads and complicating the analysis. The adopted approach takes advantage of Duhamel’s superposition principles to model these vortex effects. A physics-based methodology is used to minimize the number of constants and improve generality. Both lift and pitching-moment coefficients can be obtained as outputs. The model indicial constants are extracted from computational-fluid-dynamics calculations obtained for a number of flow conditions and deployment schedules. The model is computationally inexpensive and should be adequate for use during preliminary design studies in various aerospace applications.",54,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034007,"The progressive transition from conventional to More Electric aircraft subsystem architectures occurring in the aerospace industry necessitates earlier consideration of subsystem impacts in the design process. Significant challenges arise in this regard due to the unavailability of historical information regarding unconventional subsystem architectures as well as the limited definition of the aircraft that exists during the early design phases. This paper assesses the impact of sources of uncertainty on subsystem architectures using the Integrated Subsystem Sizing and Architecture Assessment Capability, which links subsystem and aircraft sizing and analyses. Uncertainty may arise due to limitations, assumptions, or simplifications in the undertaken modeling approach or due to variations in the assumed or projected technological state-of-the-art. In this work, some of these major sources of uncertainty are identified and propagated into the performance analysis of a selected number of subsystem architectures. Both the gross effect of all identified sources of uncertainty and the relative impacts of individual ones are evaluated. More substantially electrified subsystem architectures are seen to retain a performance advantage even in the presence of epistemic uncertainty and show more significant improvement with improving technological state-of-the-art, most notably that of power electronics, electrical generators, and electric motors.",54,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034106,"A simple mathematical model to simulate the temperature, pressure, and density distributions in intense turbulent compressible line vortices is reported. Based on the previous member of the family of vortices, a wider-range model that includes the rudimentary combined features of turbulence and compressibility is built. In antithesis to the previous laminar theoretical approaches, where the converging flow cooled down monotonically with decreasing radius, it is now discovered that, far from the axis of rotation, the gas is first heated up, reaching a static temperature maximum that is higher than the ambient value; then, it chills down to a subambient minimum at the vortex center. The cause of this effect is recognized to be the outcome of competition between two fundamental mechanisms: gas heating because of mechanical dissipation, and cooling due to mainly fluid parcel’s dilation. Thus, the present investigation identifies the cause of the Ranque–Hilsch-like thermal effect observed in unconfined compressible vortices. In comparison to laminar vortices, the center of a turbulent gaseous vortex is found to be cooler, thinner, and under lower-pressure conditions. All thermodynamic properties are shown to be functions of the vortex Mach number and level of turbulence.",54,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033856,"Autonomous contingency management systems, such as a forced-landing system, which reacts appropriately to an engine failure, are important for the safe operation of unmanned aircraft systems. This paper details a method to ascertain the reachability of any possible emergency landing site for a forced landing in steady uniform wind conditions. With knowledge of the aircraft’s state, such as speed, heading, location, and orientation of a landing site, a method to calculate a minimum height loss path is developed based on aircraft glide performance. Wind direction and speed are taken into account using a trochoidal approach by defining the minimum height loss turn path. To facilitate real-time implementation, simplified gliding equations are developed without accuracy loss. The reachability of each site can be calculated as well as how much safety margin an aircraft would have. This method is generic and could also provide decision support for human pilots in forced-landing situations. Two types of aircraft, the Airbus A320-400 and the Cessna 172, have been investigated to demonstrate the usefulness of the method, using Monte Carlo simulations in a synthetic X-Plane simulation environment, to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",54,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033986,"A new numerical method for predicting ice accretion on helicopter rotors is established. First, the orthogonal and body-fitted grids are generated around the rotor blade, and the computational fluid dynamics method for predicting flowfield of the rotor is established by solving the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Based on the Eulerian approach, the conservation equations of mass and momentum are solved to obtain the droplet flowfield properties. Then, a new three-dimensional icing model considering the influences of the centrifugal force, the movement of water film, and the variation of the azimuthal angle is put forward. The comparisons between the calculated results and experimental data about the ice accretion on a rotor indicate that the present method is effective. At last, the effects of the atmospheric temperature and the advance ratio on the icing process are analyzed. At the subfreezing temperature, the ice amount near the stagnation point increases along the spanwise direction from blade root to blade tip. The total ice amount on a blade at each azimuthal angle varies sinusoidally in one rotation period in forward flight, and the variation amplitude increases with the increase of advance ratio.",54,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034129,"This paper presents a model order reduction framework to construct linear parameter-varying reduced-order models of flexible aircraft for aeroservoelasticity analysis and control synthesis in broad two-dimensional flight parameter space. Genetic algorithms are used to automatically determine physical states for reduction and to generate reduced-order models at grid points within parameter space while minimizing the trial-and-error process. In addition, balanced truncation for unstable systems is used in conjunction with the congruence transformation technique to achieve locally optimal realization and “weak” fulfillment of state consistency across the entire parameter space. Therefore, aeroservoelasticity reduced-order models at any flight condition can be obtained simply through model interpolation. The methodology is applied to the pitch-plant model of the X-56A Multi-Use Technology Testbed currently being tested at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center for flutter suppression and gust load alleviation. The present studies indicate that the reduced-order model with more than reduction in the number of states relative to the original model is able to accurately predict system response among all input–output channels. The genetic-algorithm-guided approach exceeds manual and empirical state selection in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The interpolated aeroservoelasticity reduced-order models exhibit smooth pole transition and continuously varying gains along a set of prescribed flight conditions, which verifies consistent state representation obtained by congruence transformation. The present model order reduction framework can be used by control engineers for robust aeroservoelasticity controller synthesis and novel vehicle design.",54,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034087,"Nonconventional laminates, as defined in this paper, are laminates where ply angles are not restricted to a finite set: for example 0, 45, and 90 deg. Removing this restriction, structural behavior (for example, postimpact behavior) can be significantly improved. Nonconventional laminates are made of straight or steered fibers leading to constant- or variable-stiffness composites. In traditional composite design, empirical guidelines are imposed, guaranteeing the robustness of the composite. This paper presents a method to take design guidelines into account during nonconventional laminate optimization. The 10% rule is interpreted as a lower bound on the degree of isotropy and formulated as a positive-semidefinite matrix constraint. Other guidelines are interpreted as bounds on ply angle or angle difference, or the number of variables is reduced by fixing variables to user-defined values. Numerical results optimizing a plate under biaxial tension for strength demonstrate the optimizer generates nonconventional laminates obeying all guidelines, performing at least as well as conventional composites. For variable-stiffness laminates, a flat plate under uniaxial compression is optimized for buckling under a stiffness constraint. Applying the 10% rule, almost half of the improvement over conventional laminates is lost compared to the unconstrained case, demonstrating the importance of including design guidelines during nonconventional laminate optimization.",54,4

The numerical model is applied to the solution of unsteady flows associated to an actively controlled Gurney flap located in proximity of the trailing edge of an airfoil, with oscillations up to 20 Hz. The motion of the Gurney flap is simulated through no-slip viscous wall conditions applied to the interfaces between neighboring elements that coincide with the position of the flap at a given time instant. Several configurations of deployment motions are considered under different freestream conditions to demonstrate the capability of the solver to predict accurately unsteady nonlinear problems at high Reynolds numbers.

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034140,"A simple approach for computing unsteady aerodynamic forces from simulated measured strain data is proposed in this study. First, the deflection and slope of the structure are computed from the unsteady strain. Velocities and accelerations of the structure are computed using the autoregressive moving average model, online parameter estimator, low-pass filter, and a least-squares curve fitting method, together with analytical derivatives with respect to time. Finally, aerodynamic forces over the wing are computed using modal aerodynamic influence coefficient matrices, a rational function approximation, and a time-marching algorithm. A cantilevered rectangular wing is used to validate the simple approach. Unsteady aerodynamic forces as well as wing deflections, velocities, accelerations, and strains are computed using the CFL3D computational fluid dynamics code and the MSC/NASTRAN finite element analysis code; and these CFL3D/NASTRAN-based results are assumed as measured quantities. Computed deflections, velocities, accelerations, and unsteady aerodynamic forces are compared with the CFL3D/NASTRAN-based results. Computed aerodynamic forces based on lifting-surface theory at subsonic speeds are in good agreement with the target aerodynamic forces generated using CFL3D code with the Euler equation.

The model is extended from the baseline University of Maryland Advanced Rotor Code to include interactional rotor wake between the coaxial rotors, modeling of relative phase between rotors, and trim strategies for a coaxial helicopter. The simulation is used to define a flight envelope for an experimental rotor being developed for testing in the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel. Areas of interest are rotor performance and blade flap bending moments, particularly with variation in lift offset. Control methods and the impact of rotor phase on resulting hub loads are explored. Clearance between the tips of the upper and lower rotor is a limiting factor in testing a lift offset rotor; the impact of blade structural properties on tip clearance are examined. Tip clearance depends on lift offset and thrust but not on advance ratio. It is found that the use of moderate lift offset can improve performance and vibratory loads at the cost of increased blade loads.",54,4

A lift- and thrust-augmented coaxial compound configuration is used to demonstrate the approach. The basic optimization problem is converted into a sequence of approximate optimization problems, in which approximate Pareto frontiers are calculated based on response surfaces, obtained from radial basis function interpolation of all the designs analyzed at every step of the sequence. The Pareto frontiers are computed using a genetic algorithm. The designs are analyzed using a high-fidelity rotorcraft analysis that includes nonlinear finite element models of the rotor blade and a free vortex wake model of the rotor inflow. The results presented indicate that 1) the preliminary design problem can be effectively solved using formal numerical design optimization techniques, which therefore can complement classical design methodologies; 2) with appropriate physics-based constraints, the design optimization can be carried out by the computer completely unattended; 3) the optimization methodology is sufficiently robust to deal with multiple local optima and other numerical difficulties; and 4) the methodology is efficient enough to allow the use of high-fidelity analyses throughout the optimization, with the use of graphical processing unit computing (Compute Unified Device Architecture/Fortran) contributing to the computational efficiency.",54,4
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034044,"Airfoil stall is a major inhibitor of aircraft performance. Many methods have been successfully shown to inhibit or eliminate stall. However, the underlying dynamics of control remains relatively obscure because of the highly nonlinear nature of turbulence. A major challenge is the a priori estimation of actuation parameters without resorting to trial and error. Such estimation of parameters requires a physics-based understanding of the flowfield and its response to actuation. To study this, high-fidelity large-eddy simulations are employed to analyze active control by exploring the key dynamic modes, without and with control, through dynamic mode decomposition. A NACA 0015 stalled airfoil is considered at a Reynolds number of 100,000 and a 15 deg angle of attack. The results suggest that the dominant mode representing stall has an effective Strouhal number of two. Simulations are then performed by modeling control at using a nanosecond-pulsed dielectric barrier discharge near the leading edge. Introduction of control at this frequency is shown to successfully mitigate stall. Further analyses show that control tends to excite and destabilize predominantly higher frequencies, but it specifically stabilizes the low-frequency large-scale structures associated with stall. The results establish promise of the methodology in a priori estimation of control frequency.",54,4
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034111,"A numeric optimization is performed for maximizing the cruise performance of a multilift rotorcraft system. The optimization process locates the optimal relative positions of the formation rotorcraft. The optimization problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear programming problem. Constraints on the distances between the formation rotorcraft are imposed in order to maintain safe separation distances. It is shown that, for every airspeed, an optimal formation geometry can be found that minimizes the rotorcraft power required. An optimization analysis for subsequent airspeeds yields an optimal recommended airspeed that is close to the “bucket” airspeed of the unloaded rotorcraft. The cable length is shown to have a secondary influence on optimization results. The improvement in the resulting multilift mission performance is demonstrated using a nonlinear simulation of the system. It is shown that the operational efficiency of the system can be significantly increased by adopting the optimization results.",54,4

Different influencing factors, including engine position, engine-exhaust condition, flap deflection, and flap gap, are investigated in detail to improve powered high-lift effects. Then, flow-control techniques, such as the cove tab and downward deflection of the spoiler, are studied. The cove tab can be helpful for longitude-trim and stability problems, whereas the spoiler downward deflection can help increase lift-to-drag ratios.
