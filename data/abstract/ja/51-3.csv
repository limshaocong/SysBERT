A detailed knowledge about the severity of potential wake encounters is necessary for a safe revision of the current International Civil Aviation Organization separation requirements. Vortex encounter simulation is an important part in building an understanding how the encountering aircraft is adversely affected by the vortex-induced disturbances. Whereas most research has focused on aircraft encounters with a pair of straight vortices, this work focuses on the simulation of encounters with perturbed vortices as they are observed under various atmospheric conditions. In addition, a method to account for unsteady aerodynamic effects during the computation of vortex-induced forces and moments is presented. Those effects are becoming especially important for vortex-induced disturbances of a higher-frequency range as they may appear during encounters with perturbed vortices. This combination of models for vortex deformation due to long-wave Crow instability and unsteady aerodynamic models increases the realism of encounter simulations. The simulation models are suited for real-time and fast-time applications, such as piloted-flight-simulator experiments and fast-time Monte Carlo simulations. The results of a simulator study with airline pilots are discussed concerning the differences between encounters with straight and perturbed vortices.",51,3

Characterizing ice adhesion is critical for effective design of such a system. An experimental apparatus for measuring ice adhesion is developed, and the effects of different factors on ice adhesion are studied through experiments. The ice freezing conditions, material properties, and surface roughness are the main factors for icing adhesion strength. Aluminum and copper with different roughness are used in the present study. A nonlinear and nonmonotonic relationship between the surface roughness and freezing adhesion strength is discovered. The effect of ice freezing temperature on the icing adhesion strength is also studied by experiments.",51,3

This paper examines a fundamental issue raised by aircraft reconfigurability: design of an optimal, lightweight structure to support all of the loads experienced by each configuration. This paper reviews current methods used to design such structures and shows that simultaneous optimization can produce a lower-weight structure than other techniques. The developed optimization routine combines simultaneous optimization with a method based on Liang’s performance-based optimization for determining the optimum location of the structural members of the substructure. An overpopulated finite-element model serves as a starting point. The initial set of structural members includes ribs, spars, and a series of cross members that diagonally connect the ribs and spars. Using an iterative process, the optimization routine removes members from the design if they do not carry enough load to justify their presence. The final result is an optimized structure that displays the primary load paths and serves as the baseline for the next stages of detailed design.",51,3

In many cases, multiple responses need to be modeled to achieve multiple objectives. Considering the correlations between multiple responses in modeling the nonlinear relationship between airfoil shapes and aerodynamic performance, the authors construct multiresponse surfaces for airfoil design with multiple-output-Gaussian-process-regression model. The authors simulate computational data to evaluate the prediction accuracy and stability of the multiple-output Gaussian process in airfoil design, compared with other popular alternative approaches, kriging, and backpropagation and radial-basis-function neural networks. In the experiments, response surfaces from the airfoil shapes, parameterized by the class/shape-function-transformation method, to lift, drag, and pitching-moment coefficients are constructed. The results indicate that the multiple-output Gaussian process receives higher prediction accuracy and stability in modeling multiresponse surfaces than other popular methods when there are significant correlations between responses.",51,3

This is partly due to the stringent quality control and rigorous testing of the control-law and air-data-system algorithms carried out on various ground platforms before flight. One of these ground test platforms is the hardware-in-loop test platform (Iron Bird). The processing of tolerance bounds to define the pass/fail criteria is an algorithmic development. It guarantees the correctness of the modules, if the set of inputs generates a set of outputs within processed tolerance bounds. This paper presents the philosophy behind the design of test cases and the tools developed to evaluate the control-law and air-data-system modules on the Iron Bird platform, and the procedure to clear the test results. The computation of tolerance bounds and algorithms for their processing have been evolved over a period based on several criteria, testers’ experience, and the experience gained during various levels of testing of air-data-system and control-law algorithms. This process yielded excellent results, and is accepted as a formal clearance methodology for the onboard safety-critical fly-by-wire system software.",51,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032399,"A decomposed Fourier-series solution to Prandtl’s classical lifting-line theory is used to examine the effects of rigid-body roll and small-angle wing flapping on the lift, induced-drag, and power coefficients developed by a finite wing. This solution shows that, if the flapping rate for any wing is large enough, the mean induced drag averaged over a complete flapping cycle will be negative, that is, the wing flapping produces net induced thrust. For quasi-steady flapping in pure plunging, the solution predicts that wing flapping has no net effect on the mean lift. A significant advantage of this analytical solution over commonly used numerical methods is the utility provided for optimizing wing-flapping cycles. The analytical solution involves five time-dependent functions that could all be optimized to maximize thrust, propulsive efficiency, and/or other performance measures. Results show that, by optimizing only one of these five functions, propulsive efficiencies exceeding 90% can be attained. For the case of an elliptic planform with linear twist, closed-form relations are presented for the decomposed Fourier coefficients and the flapping rate that produces mean induced thrust that balances the mean drag in the absence of wing flapping.",51,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032463,"This paper describes the experimental investigation of a quad-shrouded rotor micro air vehicle and focuses on the hover performance improvements over a conventional unshrouded micro quad rotor. The effects of number of rotor blades, blade root pitch angle, and shroud diffuser length on aerodynamic performance were studied. The rotor diameter was 6.6 cm, it had a tip of 20,000, and the gross weight of the vehicle was 90 g, with a shroud weight fraction of 13%. With the optimized design, the power loading of the quad-shrouded rotor was about 15% greater than the unshrouded configuration. To completely evaluate the configuration, the performance of the vehicle in edgewise flow was investigated. The drag and pitching moment for the shrouded rotor was about 2.5 times greater than the unshrouded vehicle. However, control-moment measurements suggested that the edgewise gust tolerance was at least . The vehicle prototype was also successfully flight tested in hover using onboard feedback regulation. Based on these studies, the shrouded rotor concept appears feasible in improving performance of a conventional micro quad rotor even at and can be easily retrofitted into existing configurations.",51,3

The damage scenario considered was a midbay-to-midbay saw-cut with a severed stiffener, flange, and skin. Advanced modeling techniques such as mesh-independent definition of compliant fasteners and elastic-plastic material properties for metal parts were used in the finite-element analysis supporting the design effort. A bolted metallic repair was selected so that it could be easily applied in the operational environment. The present work describes results obtained from a tension panel test conducted to validate both the repair concept and finite-element analysis techniques used in the design effort. The test proved that the proposed repair concept is capable of sustaining load levels that are higher than those resulting from the current working stress allowables. This conclusion enables upward revision of the stress allowables that had been kept at an overly conservative level due to concerns associated with repairability of the panels. Correlation of test data with finite-element analysis results is also presented and assessed.",51,3

It was important to develop a responsible approach to predict the remaining life. An analytical model for the prediction of crack initiation life caused by pits under the interaction of fatigue load and a corrosive environment was proposed in this paper. The effect of the aspect ratio of the pit on the crack initiation life was considered in this model.

9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032451,"In wing morphing, it is desirable to have a system that acts both as a load-bearing structure and a morphing mechanism, without any distinction between the two. When dealing with a rather large design space, designing for this requirement would be less challenging because the constituting structural elements could be topologically placed in a fashion to enhance the static characteristics of the system, without sacrificing its kinematic abilities. However, in the case of an aircraft wing, where the design space is highly restrictive, conventional approaches typically yield inefficient designs from a static perspective. Such restrictions have served as inspirations for the proposed concept of a reconfigurable system, which is able to alter its kinematic and static characteristics to act both as a mechanism and a high-stiffness structure. The optimal configuration design of this system, referred to as the variable geometry wing-box is discussed in this paper. The optimal configuration design problem is posed in two parts: 1) the optimal limb configuration, and 2) the optimal topological configuration. The former seeks the optimal design of the kinematic joints and links, while the latter seeks the minimal compliance solution to their placement within the design space. In addition to the static and kinematic criteria required for reconfigurability, practical design considerations such as fail-safe requirements and design for minimal aeroelastic impact are included as constraints in the optimization process. In the end, the optimal configuration for the variable geometry wing-box is presented, and its rigidity is validated using a reconfigurable prototype.",51,3

Sealants are commonly used to prevent the ingress of corrosion at the faying surfaces of lap joints, and in this study, an attempt is made to exploit sealant presence to reduce necessary robotic path planning procedures. Controller parameters are tuned, and baseline tracking performance is established with milled channels, which are used to replicate the force signature of sealant, and the tracking technique is then evaluated with Pelseal® 2077 sealant applied in a prescribed fashion in both cured and uncured states.

11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032544,"The increased use of composites in airframe structures creates some very challenging design problems where the need for low weight and low, or at least acceptable, cost dictate very careful selection of design concepts and fabrication processes. Typical examples of challenging structural details are highly loaded connections with parts meeting at an angle. Usually, optimizing the individual components of the joint yields relatively low weight savings. Only by redesigning the adjacent structure and optimizing load transfer and redistribution can one benefit from the use of composites to the fullest and generate highly weight-efficient structures. The case of the floor–skin attachment for a transport fuselage with skins made with grid-stiffened structure is used as the example in this study. Finite elements and local analysis methods are combined for the design iterations. It is shown that, by incorporating the floor substructure and the skin into the design problem and redistributing the load between the different joining members, low-cost low-weight structures can be generated.",51,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032416,"A statistical engineering approach featuring a formally designed experiment has recently been implemented for calibration of an internal, strain-gauged, wind-tunnel balance at Arnold Engineering Development Complex. It was necessary to consider a substantially wide variation in balance temperature for this particular application. The cost to perform a balance calibration with the balance equilibrium temperature as a completely randomized factor was therefore prohibitive. A design-of-experiments approach using a run schedule with restricted randomization, known commonly as a split-plot design, is being evaluated. For more than a decade, design of experiments has been implemented in wind-tunnel strain-gauge balance calibration processes. Calibration with design of experiments is a characterization process where data are collected and analyzed using statistical methods, allowing conclusions to be drawn with chosen levels of confidence and power. A sequential approach to new balance calibration using existing hardware was demonstrated using a crossed design. A modified, two-active-factor, Box–Behnken design was executed at three temperature levels, and a second-order regression model was constructed in all factors. When compared to the traditional approach, a minimum 50% reduction in calibration duration and a reduction in overall residual error were demonstrated.",51,3

This paper presents the extended finite-element approach for the prediction of the failure loads, fracture toughness for multiple-edge crack configurations using virtual crack closer technique, and cohesive approach for extensively used aircraft material. Experiments are performed considering the different edge crack configurations to validate the predicted extended finite-element results. The finite-element prediction of failure load and fracture toughness show good agreement with experimental results. Typical numerical results are presented to examine the effect of crack inclination angle, relative position of crack and material properties on failure load, and fracture toughness of a finite alloy plate. Based on extended finite-element and experimental results, mathematical models for estimation of failure load and fracture toughness for multiple-edge crack configurations are introduced.",51,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032530,"In aerospace systems design, conflicting disciplines and technologies are always involved in the design process. There are often subjective decisions made in the conceptual design phase, and these subjective decisions have significant impacts on the performance of the final design. Multicriteria decision analysis techniques can help designers to effectively deal with such situations and make wise design decisions. The objective of this paper is to explore the feasibility and added values of applying multicriteria decision analysis techniques in aircraft design. In the first part of the paper, we establish a new optimization framework incorporating multicriteria decision analysis techniques in aircraft conceptual design process. Then, we propose an improved multicriteria decision analysis method to aggregate the multiple design criteria into one composite figure of merit for the optimization. The improved multicriteria decision analysis method is able to maintain ranking consistency for the top-ranked alternative. In the second part of the paper, we assess the subjective preferences from different designers in aircraft design process. We solve the specification problem of weighting factors by using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) with Dirichlet distribution. Finally, we develop surrogate models for the multiple design criteria in terms of weighting factors to perform the uncertainty assessment efficiently.",51,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032453,"This paper presents a methodology for performing dynamic and parametric scanning operations for unmanned aircraft systems on remote sensing missions. Most unmanned aircraft system autopilots only support elemental waypoint-based guidance, whereas most remote sensing applications imply the surveillance of wide areas that require the execution of elaborate scan patterns. Moreover, the long endurance of unmanned aircraft system platforms allows one to envisage future operations in which the areas to be scanned may dynamically change during an unmanned aircraft system flight. Using elemental waypoints to design and potentially update scan patterns is a time-consuming, inefficient, and highly restrictive strategy. This paper discusses how to provide dynamic parametric scans over an area-navigation-like flight-plan manager that feeds basic waypoints to the unmanned aircraft system autopilot. Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed method based on flight simulations of complex unmanned aircraft system surveillance operations.",51,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032501,"A nonlinear flutter analysis is performed to study the limit-cycle-oscillation characteristics of an F-35 wind-tunnel model with horizontal-tail free-play effects using a direct simulation method. The result of this study is first validated with the wind-tunnel data. Then, a set of free-play design charts is generated to investigate the limit-cycle-oscillation-occurrence domain at various free-play angles and hinge moments of the horizontal tail. It is found that, as long as the horizontal tail is unloaded, the limit-cycle oscillation is inevitable even with a very small free-play angle. Furthermore, the free-play angle cannot be the only significant parameter involved in the free-play criteria. Therefore, it is suggested that an improved military specification for free-play limits of all-movable control surfaces be established. This effort will make a substantial impact on the control-surface design that may lead to a paradigm shift in the design criteria of aircraft structure.",51,3

18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032605,"Wing design involves many compromises, but none more important than the one between aerodynamics, represented by lift-to-drag ratio, and structural weight. Multidisciplinary design optimization is used to compare the effect of configuration changes on wing weight and lift/drag ratio for 1) cantilever, 2) strut-braced, and 3) truss-braced wing aircraft for a medium-range, transonic, 162 passenger mission. Pseudo-Pareto fronts are generated to illustrate maximum lift/drag ratio compared to minimum wing weight. Lower lift/drag ratio aircraft have a shorter, more highly swept wing, with a change in taper at 75% semispan. Higher lft/drag ratio aircraft have much greater span and maximum chord at 33% semispan. To increase lift/drag ratio, both wing-weight and takeoff gross weight penalties must be paid. However, there are high lift/drag ratio designs with low wing-weight penalty that are clearly displayed by the pseudo-Pareto front. Fuel weight minima were found in the high lift/drag ratio and low wing-weight region of the pseudo-Pareto front for the truss-braced wing with both fuselage-mounted and wing-mounted engine configurations and for the cantilever configuration. An interesting pseudo-Pareto front was observed for the wing-mounted engine truss-braced wing configuration, where the pseudo-Pareto front almost became an asymptote to a lift/drag ratio of . Also, one can look across all the configurations and compare attractive designs from each to search for an overall best aircraft design.",51,3

The sliding mesh technology is used to simulate the relative motion between the wing-in-ground-effect craft and wavy ground. The effects of the wavy ground, flight height, and angle of attack on the aerodynamic characteristics and flowfield are analyzed in detail. The aerodynamic forces are found to be periodic when the wing-in-ground-effect craft flies over wavy ground. The aerodynamic forces over both flat and wavy ground vary with flight height in the same pattern. As the flight height reduces, the lift, drag, and nose-down pitching moment all increase at both angles of attack ( and ); however, the lift-to-drag ratio increases for all flight heights at , while it first increases and then decreases at . Reduction in the flight height at eventually causes the attached flow to evolve into separated flow on the upper surface of the wing. Therefore, at higher angle of attack of , the lower the flight height is, the larger is the flow separation region; thus, the lift-to-drag ratio increases to the maximum at a certain flight height and then begins to decrease as the flight height decreases.",51,3

This is done via solid isotropic material with penalization-based topology optimization: the stiffeners are discretized into finite elements, and each element is assigned a design variable, which may vary from 0 (void) to 1 (solid). A known issue with eigenvalue-based optimization is discontinuities due to mode switching, which may be avoided through a series of eigenvalue separation constraints, or (more challenging, but less restrictive) a bound method with mode tracking. Both methods are demonstrated to obtain optimal stiffener topologies for panel buckling, but only the former is used for aeroelastic panel-flutter problems.

22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032507,"It is crucial to guide airplane passengers in effectively choosing reasonable evacuation exits, according to the consequences of evacuation in post-crash accidents. This paper presents a performance simulation method to analyze the safety of the evacuation procedures. The temperature and the concentration of carbon monoxide are pointed out as the main threats during the evacuation. Thus, the modified formulas of these two hazard factors are defined as the safety lines to measure the overrun of each indicator. The Fire Dynamics Simulator and Pathfinder are used to measure the available safe egress time and the required safe egress time, respectively, for each exit in an A380 aircraft. The available exits are determined to ensure the safety of passengers, based on the time interval between the available safe egress time and the required safe egress time. According to the simulation, the flashover cannot happen within 90 s, and many passengers who choose exits 3 and 5 are in danger during the evacuation. The utilization rates of the three exits in the upper cabin are very low. This paper proposes an optimized evacuation plan to ensure the safety of passengers.",51,3
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032049,"This paper describes a new framework for the synthesis of aircraft flyover noise through a nonstandard atmosphere. Central to the framework is a ray-tracing algorithm that defines multiple curved propagation paths, if the atmosphere allows, between the moving source and listener. Because each path has a different emission angle, synthesis of the sound at the source must be performed independently for each path. The time delay, spreading loss, and absorption (ground and atmosphere) are integrated along each path and applied to each synthesized aircraft noise source to simulate a flyover. A final step assigns each resulting signal to its corresponding receiver angle for the simulation of a flyover in a virtual reality environment. Spectrograms of the results from a straight path and a curved path modeling assumption are shown. When the aircraft is at close range, the straight path results are valid. Differences appear especially when the source is relatively far away at shallow elevation angles. These differences, however, are not significant in common sound metrics. Although the framework used in this work performs off-line processing, it is conducive to real-time implementation.",51,3
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032618,"Laminated composites are becoming very popular in the aerospace industry because of their high strength-to-weight ratio and the fact that their properties can be tailored by changing different parameters like fiber and matrix materials, ratio of fiber to matrix volumes, fiber orientations, sequence of the plies, etc. However, because of their heterogeneity, an accurate analysis of composite laminates requires very high time and storage space. In the presence of structural discontinuities like cracks, delaminations, cutouts, etc., the computational complexity increases significantly. A possible alternative to reduce the computational complexity is the global–local analysis, which involves an approximate analysis of the whole structure followed by a detailed analysis of a significantly smaller region of interest. We investigate here the performance of the global–local scheme based on the finite-element method by comparing it to the traditional finite-element method. To do so, we conduct a two-dimensional structural analysis of a composite square plate, with a thin rectangular notch at its center, subjected to a uniform transverse pressure, using the commercial software ABAQUS. We show that the presence of the thin notch affects only the local response of the structure and that the size of the affected area depends on the notch length. We show that, to get an accurate result, the selection of the local region of the local model depends on the mesh density used in the global model. We analyze also the distribution of the bending moments about the principal axis especially near the discontinuity and its dependence on the notch size. We show that the plate tends to bend about the axis of the notch in the whole plate except at the notch-free edge, where that moment goes to zero and the plate tends to bend perpendicularly to the notch. Finally, we compute the response of the structure for different notch shapes. The results show that the shape of the notch affects only the local response of the structure at the notch tip.",51,3

However, the mechanism of the phenomena was not well acknowledged from the conclusion of the icing researches. The dendritic ice growth is thought to greatly influence the ice-growth velocity, and is rarely mentioned in aircraft-icing researches. In this paper, an aircraft supercooled icing model for ice-shape simulation is developed, based on the properties of dendritic ice growth in supercooled water. And the potential consequence of dendritic ice growth to ice-accretion rate on aircraft is discussed theoretically. The supercooled icing model is compared with the Messinger model through the analysis of icing film and the ice-shape simulation. It concludes that the supercooled icing model can well predict the ice-accretion rate, the ice shape, and the surface temperature. Compared with the Messinger model, the supercooled icing model has obvious advantages in predicting rapid ice growth and severe runback phenomena. Further investigations based on the supercooled-water physical features on aircraft will shed more light on the icing mechanism.",51,3

28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032555,"Because of ever-stricter regulations on noise production, it has become more difficult for airports to expand. A ground-based propulsion system is presented that allows airplanes to accelerate to higher liftoff speeds, increase their climb rate, and thereby reduce their noise footprint. This system has been sized for airplanes with a maximum takeoff weight of 90 t or less. The system consists of a shuttle, which is magnetically propelled by a linear motor. The shuttle provides a propulsion force of 227 kN, which is transferred to the airplane via a launch bar of 4.5 m. This bar connects to the keel beam of the airplane, ahead of the most forward position of the center of gravity. To assess the effect on noise, fuel consumption, and field length, six different takeoff scenarios were conceived and analyzed using a numerical simulation model of the system. Three of these scenarios included an increased liftoff speed of . Results show that, depending on the takeoff scenario, a 20% reduction in awakenings is possible for a single departure from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Furthermore, alternative takeoff scenarios show a possible 60% reduction in fuel burn during the takeoff phase or a 20% decrease in required takeoff field length.",51,3

Their use is necessary in desert environments to eliminate the risk of rapid engine wear and subsequent power deterioration. However, their employment is concomitant with an inherent loss in inlet pressure and, in some cases, auxiliary power. There are three main technologies: vortex tubes, barrier filters, and integrated inlet particle separators. The present study compares the pros and cons of each device, applying where possible analytical theory, and using computational methods to generate performance data. The vortex tube separators are found to achieve the lowest pressure drop, whereas the barrier filters exhibit the highest particle removal rate. The integrated inlet particle separator creates the lowest drag. The barrier filter and vortex tube separators are much superior to the integrated particle separator in improving the engine lifetime, based on erosion by uncaptured particles. The erosion rate predicted when vortex tube separators are used is two times that of a barrier filter; however, the latter experiences a temporal (but recoverable postcleaning) loss of approximately 1% power.",51,3
