0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035225,"Wake turbulence is commonly a commercial aviation topic involving relatively heavy transport aircraft. However, wake turbulence is also safety relevant for business and general aviation flight operations. A detailed analysis has been conducted for a specific accident involving two aircraft of the wake turbulence category light. A four-seat aircraft with 1 ton maximum takeoff weight took off behind a biplane with 5.5 ton maximum takeoff weight. This led to a fatal accident. Based on available information and several assumptions, the wake turbulence aspects for the specific accident scenario have been assessed. The roll axis was the dominating factor in this case. Accordingly, the wake induced rolling moment was analyzed and related to the assumed available roll control power. Furthermore, the wake vortex behavior was simulated and analyzed in detail. The results indicate that wake turbulence can be considered to be the cause of the accident. The theoretical results and the conclusions regarding the accident are also supported by the results of flight tests, which were conducted in the context of the accident investigation.",56,5

The presented configuration combines a boundary-layer controlled flaps system with the benefits of propeller slipstream deflection. The underlying aerodynamic models and assumptions are provided. The extraordinary flight performances especially at low airspeed will be pointed out, as well as potential weaknesses. Special attention is paid to the unusually strong aerodynamic couplings in the lateral motion. Therefore, flight dynamics characteristics will be presented and their challenges discussed.

2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035218,"The primary drawbacks of battery-powered vertical takeoff and landing [electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL)] aircraft are their poor range and endurance with practical payloads. The objective of this paper is to examine the potential of hydrogen fuel cells to overcome this drawback. The paper develops steady-state and transient models of fuel cells and batteries, and it validates the models experimentally. It demonstrates fuel cell and battery power sharing in a regulated parallel configuration to achieve a reduction in powerplant weight. Finally, the paper outlines the weight models of motors, batteries, and fuel cells needed for eVTOL sizing, and it carries out a sizing analysis for on-demand urban air-taxi missions. This revealed that, for ranges within 75 miles, a lightweight (5000–6000 lb gross weight) all-electric tilting proprotor configuration is feasible with current levels of battery specific energy if high C-rate batteries are available (4–10 C for 2.5 min). For any mission beyond 50 miles, fuel cells appear to be a compelling candidate. Although fuel cells alone do not offer significant improvements to batteries, the two electric power sources can be combined for significant payload gains. In the combined powerplant, the fuel cell is sized to the low-power cruise mode and the battery supplements during higher power. For missions of less than 50 miles, the combination provides no advantage with current technology, and battery specific energy is the principal driver.",56,5

Current flight simulation capabilities are unable to accurately reproduce the complex wake interference effects on the receiver aircraft, solely accounting for the inviscid vortex. This research develops an aerodynamic interference module that may be incorporated into the simulation environment to account for incremental changes in the forces and moments on the receiver aircraft as it approaches the tanker during typical refueling scenarios. The interference module is based on low-order response surface models derived from a database of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics predictions. The low-order model encompasses all of the complex wake effects on the receiver aerodynamic coefficients and may be quickly interrogated for use in real-time flight simulation. Predicted aerodynamic coefficient increments are validated against flight data for an E-2D receiver trailing behind a KC-135 tanker.",56,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035098,"In this paper, linear and nonlinear divergence and flutter analyses for damaged high-aspect-ratio wings undergoing large deformations are presented. To exploit the computational efficiency of reduced dimensional beam models along with the accuracy of three-dimensional continuum models, a joined multidimensional finite element approach is proposed. To this end, the computational model of a high-aspect-ratio wing is divided into two parts: a one-dimensional geometrically exact beam model, which constitutes most of the wing structure, and a small three-dimensional region encompassing structural damages. The two parts are rigorously joined together at their intersection through a transformation derived using the variational asymptotic method. Aerodynamic forces and moments, acting upon the wing, are accounted for using a two-dimensional finite-state unsteady aerodynamic theory. The wing structure is made of layered composite materials with various layup arrangements. The preexisting structural damages are assumed to be in the form of crack and delamination. The intensity and locations of the structural damages are varying along the wing. Accordingly, linear and nonlinear aeroelastic stability analyses are carried out in order to study the effects of various structural damages on the divergence and flutter boundaries of the wing.",56,5

Experiments are performed in a controlled environment, with a detailed monitoring of the temperature all along the liner sample. The liner impedance is either derived from the reflection coefficient measured in a normal impedance tube or is educed with an inverse method from acoustic velocity or wall pressure fields measured in the ONERA grazing flow duct. The influence of the acoustic source level on the temperature of the sample is also addressed, which enlightens a strong multiphysics coupling between acoustics, flow, and thermal phenomena.",56,5

Simulations were performed both with and without the nacelle/pylon feature as prescribed by the workshop test cases. Without the nacelle/pylon, evidence of multiple solutions was observed when a quadratic constitutive relation was used in the turbulence modeling; however, time-accurate simulations seemed to favor one solution over the other. With the nacelle/pylon, no evidence of multiple solutions was observed. Laminar–turbulent transition modeling was also applied to the configuration, and it had an overall favorable impact on the lift predictions.",56,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035301,"This paper describes methods to improve the performance of a vertical stabilizer in terms of yawing moment with corotating blade-type vortex generators and a dorsal fin over a wide range of sideslip angles. A vertical stabilizer designed by ONERA was mounted on the NASA Common Research Model to investigate the performance of sets of vortex generators and dorsal fins at several rudder deflection angles. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to reveal basic flow characteristics of the vertical stabilizer, including its rudder, and to understand how vortices generated around the vortex generators and dorsal fins interact with the leading-edge separation vortex and boundary layer on the vertical stabilizer and how the vortices improve the lateral performance of the vertical stabilizer. Wind-tunnel tests were also conducted to validate the computational results. Vortex generators improved the performance of the vertical stabilizer slightly at low sideslip angles by reducing flow separation on the rudder, and a dorsal fin assisted greatly at high sideslip angles due to two vortices it induced: the primary dorsal fin vortex and the leading-edge separation vortex.",56,5

In this work, a trajectory control system capable of passively guiding a high-altitude balloon is discussed. Using convention common to aircraft literature, the pitch stability and maximum possible guiding force of a given sail geometry are derived in closed form. A system model is then presented, which facilitates a study of the performance of the system. Using the full model, system performance is compared for various parameters, such as tether location and sail mass. It is found that the tether location influences the pitch stability and affects control authority. Furthermore, sail performance is found to be a function of the sail mass, and the ratio of spanwise center of pressure and spanwise center of mass locations.",56,5

Flights have been divided into firefighting, ferry, and maintenance/training missions. Firefighting flights have been divided into five separate phases. The recorded normal accelerations have been filtered to remove the frequencies due to structural vibration and have been divided into gust and maneuver loads using the two-second rule. Using the method of peaks-between-means, exceedance spectra for gust and maneuver loads have been developed for ground-air-ground cycles, as well as for specific flight phases. The results have been compared with those of the legacy air tankers and other aircraft flown in support of firefighting missions and as civil transport. The maneuver load factor spectra are shown to indicate smaller loads than those of legacy air tankers, but exceeding considerably in frequency those of civil transport.",56,5

To calculate the high-frequency energy response of a vibro-acoustic system with interval parameters, an affine interval perturbation statistical energy analysis (AIPSEA) is proposed by combining the interval perturbation analysis, the affine arithmetic, and the statistical energy analysis (SEA). The subinterval technique is introduced in AIPSEA to improve the computational accuracy of AIPSEA when the levels of uncertainty are high. Numerical simulations of a plate-cavity coupled system and a simplified launch vehicle fairing with interval parameters are conducted. The accuracy of proposed method is verified by the Monte Carlo statistical energy analysis (MCSEA). Simulation results indicate that the accuracy of interval perturbation statistical energy analysis (IPSEA) and AIPSEA decreases with the increasing uncertainty levels. AIPSEA has better performance than IPSEA in the vibro-acoustic analysis of the system with interval parameters. By employing the subinterval technique, the computational accuracy of AIPSEA is significantly improved.",56,5

Distributed electric propulsion could potentially decrease takeoff distances enough to enable thousands of potential intercity runways. This conceptual study explores the effects of a retrofit of open-bladed electric propulsion units. To model and explore the design space, blade element momentum method, vortex lattice method, linear-beam finite element analysis, classical laminate theory, composite failure, empirically based blade noise modeling, motor and motor-controller mass models, and gradient-based optimization are used. With liftoff time of seconds and the safe total field length for this aircraft type undefined, this paper focused on the minimum conceptual takeoff distance. It was found that 16 propellers could reduce the takeoff distance by over 50% compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 20.5 m to clear a 50 ft (15.24 m) obstacle. It was also found that, when decreasing the allowable noise by approximately 10 dBa, the 8-propeller case performed the best with a 43% reduction in takeoff distance compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a noise-restricted conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 95 m.",56,5

The study starts with updating the noise prediction of the MFN configuration modeled for the timeframe between 2025 and 2035, with a prediction of 34.3 dB cumulative effective perceived noise level below the stage 4 regulation. A suite of technologies that are deemed feasible to mature for practical implementation in the far term and for which the potentials for noise reduction have been demonstrated is selected for analysis. For each technology, component noise reduction is modeled either by available experimental data or by physics-based modeling with aircraft system-level methods. The noise reduction is then applied to the corresponding component predicted by advanced aircraft noise prediction tools. It is shown that the far-term MFN aircraft has the potential to achieve a cumulative effective perceived noise level up to 40.2 dB below stage 4 if all noise reductions are fully realizable. The key technologies to achieve this low noise level are assessed by the impact of each technology on the aircraft system noise.",56,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035001,"The ecology of air traffic includes society attitudes toward reducing fuel consumption and minimizing noise emissions. Aircraft noise exposure can be reduced by optimizing standard instrument departure (SID) routes according to area navigation (RNAV) specifications to reduce noise pollution for people who live in the airport vicinity. Various airport construction projects, aircraft departures, and increased density can have unintended noise pollution to those nearby an airport. Issues and concerns of airport traffic noise abatement through departure route RNAV optimization are demonstrated for the Birmingham Airport. The paper describes the proposal for a new Birmingham Airport SID, which effectively directs air traffic noise outside Balsall Common. The description of the construction of the new route is verified by calculations, not only of the minimum altitudes above obstacles, but also of the minimum distance between waypoints. The construction of protective zones at individual waypoint turns, where strict rules for minimum altitudes over obstacles apply, facilitates meeting safety standards. A map of the areas that will be most exposed to excessive noise is visualized to verify the results. The departure noise abatement procedure could be successfully used for conducting a local environment noise study to predict and mitigate noise in the area, and eventually optimize aircraft guidance on the departure route to improve the quality of life in Balsall Common.",56,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035319,"Multicopters are increasingly becoming popular for hobby and commercial applications. A variety of quadcopter, hexacopter, and octocopter configurations have emerged, yet few publications carefully investigate their performance. This paper contributes results from a series of dynamometer, wind-tunnel, and autonomous flight tests over different propeller configurations, flight speeds, and angles of attack. A modular small hexacopter platform providing propulsion unit redundancy is tested in the standard tractor configuration and a less common pusher configuration. Static thrust as a function of propeller, motor revolutions per minute, and motor current was determined from dynamometer tests. The hexacopter was mounted on a load cell test stand, and data were collected in the University of Michigan’s wind tunnel over different freestream flow speeds, motor thrust percentages, and hexacopter angles of attack. To validate wind-tunnel performance findings, outdoor autonomous flight tests were conducted. Results show the pusher configuration generates approximately 15% more thrust (lift) than do tractor propellers; however, they exhibit a relatively poor lift-to-drag ratio. These results suggests that a pusher configuration hexacopter will have higher efficiency for local-area surveillance applications requiring hover and slow flight, whereas a tractor configuration is more efficient for payload transport applications that require forward flight at appreciable velocities.",56,5

There is an acute need for reduction of the noise produced during takeoff in aircraft carriers. This paper describes the fluid insert noise reduction technology, also referred to as “distributed blowing.” The method involves injection of air through the divergent wall of a converging–diverging nozzle to generate fluid inserts. Substantial noise reductions in small-scale experiments have been achieved for mixing noise in the maximum noise emission direction and in broadband shock-associated noise. This paper describes the extension of the methodology to moderate-scale experiments conducted in industry. Changes to the original small-scale design for use in the industry-scale model experiments are described. The experiments were conducted in the GE Aviation Cell 41 Laboratory, and noise reductions were achieved that were very similar to those obtained in the small-scale experiments. Changes to the operating parameters produced noise reductions that in some cases exceeded comparable small-scale results. Scaling the moderate-scale experiments to a full-scale aircraft produces reductions in the A-weighted spectral peak that exceed 7 dB in the direction of maximum noise emission.",56,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034930,"Simultaneous design of an aircraft and its sensor systems offers advantages over integrating standard sensors because the need for sensor function can be balanced against the integration issues. A model of the detection chain is here defined as mathematical representations of the sensors, the wave propagation, and the signatures of the target. When used in aircraft concept development in a design space exploration context, the model of the detection chain needs to be simple yet detailed enough to sufficiently describe both the sensor performance and the impact it has on the infrastructure of the aircraft. In this paper a detection chain model for radar is introduced. It includes the detection range, search volume, and signature together with implications in terms of the aircraft infrastructure the parameters of mass, the volume, and power and cooling requirements as a function of antenna size. The best choice of radar cannot be determined by the sensor function alone; it has to be evaluated together with the aircraft in tactical simulations in order to obtain the complete picture. The benefits of a larger antenna can, to some degree, be counteracted by the changes to the aircraft that affect its flight performance.",56,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035416,"Small fixed-wing unmanned aerial systems (UAS) may require increased agility when operating in turbulent wind fields. In these conditions, conventional sensor suites could be augmented with additional flow-sensing to extend the aircraft’s usable flight envelope. Inspired by distributed sensor arrays in biological systems, a UAS with a chordwise array of pressure sensors was developed. Wind-tunnel testing characterized these sensors alongside a conventional airspeed sensor and an angle-of-attack (AoA) vane, and showed a single pressure measurement gave a linear response to AoA prestall. Flight tests initially manually piloted the vehicle through pitching maneuvers, then in a series of automated maneuvers based on closed-loop feedback using an estimate of AoA from the single pressure port. The AoA estimate was successfully used to control the attitude of the aircraft. An artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to estimate the AoA and airspeed using all pressure ports in the array, and validated using flight-trial data. The ANN more accurately estimated the AoA over a single-port method with good robustness to stall and unsteady flow. Distributed flow sensors could be used to supplement conventional flight control systems, providing enhanced information about wing flow conditions with application to systems with highly flexible or morphing wings.",56,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035402,"This paper proposes a new design exploration methodology, effectiveness-based design (EBD), to incorporate multidisciplinary analysis and design optimization, and uncertainty quantification earlier in the design process. The proposed EBD employs mission effectiveness objectives directly through physics-constrained operational analysis rather than relying on proxies such as aircraft weight, range, or fuel burn over a static mission or group of missions. Surrogate models are leveraged as part of EBD to achieve coupling between physics while being able to efficiently perform uncertainty quantification. To achieve EBD of an aircraft, a multiparameter performance code that accounts for variable engine features of a numerical and installed numerical propulsion system simulation coupled with a computational fluid dynamics analysis is executed in place of operational analysis. Various surrogate modeling methods are investigated for the approximated representation of the coupled physics, and it is found that the nondeterministic kriging is suitable to produce robust predictions requiring fewer off-design evaluations. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a generic fighter aircraft subject to uncertain flight and combat conditions is assessed through a combat mission.",56,5

LCO due to a constant freeplay has been extensively studied, whereas the converse phenomenon of mechanical wear and freeplay growth due to LCO is little explored. In the present work, a first-of-its-kind theoretical model for freeplay growth is developed by introducing LCO characteristics into Archard’s sliding wear model. The closed-form solution for a fixed airspeed is validated against an iterative method in prior literature and subsequently extended to the case of time-varying flight conditions. It is observed that under the action of LCO the freeplay will grow to become unbounded in finite time. The influence of the geometry and material properties of the bearings and links on freeplay growth is discussed, which can aid in actuation circuit design. The utility of the model is demonstrated by calculation of freeplay growth trends due to LCO and also by analysis of freeplay limits from the design/maintenance perspective.",56,5

Firstly, MR damper is designed on the basis of dynamic properties of a commercial oleo-pneumatic passive damper. To satisfy the fail-safe condition of MR damper, two orifices are used to provide asymmetry properties via a recoil valve. Second, in order to evaluate the landing efficiency, the equation of motion of a landing gear model with MR damper is derived, and two different controllers are formulated: a skyhook controller and a hybrid controller, which is featured by both the skyhook and force control actions. It is shown through computer simulations that the landing efficiency of the hybrid controller is much better than the conventional skyhook controller.",56,5
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035515,"A low speed wind tunnel investigation is presented characterizing the effect of leading and trailing edge flaps on thin flat plate airfoils at low Reynolds numbers. Flap size and setting angle were varied. Tests were conducted at Reynolds numbers of 40,000, 60,000, and 80,000, consistent with the operational regime of micro aerial vehicles. Performance was contrasted against a circular arc profile and three conventional airfoils. Testing encompassed force balance and surface pressure measurement. The numeric data were complemented by on and off surface flow visualization as well as the development of an analytic prediction model. The results indicate that the deployment of leading and trailing edge flaps can significantly improve the airfoil’s efficiency—not just compared with a flat plate but also a 5% camber circular arc profile. For the tested geometries, a leading and trailing edge flap angle of 15 deg was optimal. Conventional airfoil performance degraded significantly at low Reynolds numbers, yielding efficiencies far below any of the flat plate airfoils for and 60,000. Increasing the Reynolds number to 80,000 showed a dramatic improvement in the performance of the conventional airfoils.",56,5

The analysis should consider the uncertainty in a system, which may cause significant changes in its behavior. The inclusion of the uncertainty in the design process makes the identification of an optimum design more challenging.

These optimization strategies aim to solve problems that are very time-demanding and for which it is difficult (and expensive) to determine derivatives and to identify and define the optimum set of parameters.

23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035152,"The traditional aircraft design process relies upon low-fidelity models for expedience and resource savings. However, the reduced accuracy and reliability of low-fidelity tools often lead to the discovery of design defects or inadequacies late in the design process. These deficiencies result in either costly changes or the acceptance of a configuration that does not meet expectations. Multifidelity methods attempt to blend the increased accuracy and reliability of high-fidelity models with the reduced cost of low-fidelity models. A new multifidelity algorithm has been proposed, combining elements from typical trust region model management and classical quasi-Newton methods. In this paper, the algorithm is compared with a single-fidelity quasi-Newton method for complex aeroelastic simulations. The vehicle design problem includes variables for planform shape, structural sizing, and cruise condition with constraints on trim and structural stresses. Considering the objective function reduction versus computational expenditure, the multifidelity process performs better in three of four cases in early iterations compared with a single-fidelity approach. A contracting trust region is found to slow the progress of the multifidelity optimizer. However, by leveraging the approximate inverse Hessian, the optimization can be seamlessly continued using high-fidelity data alone. Ultimately, the proposed new algorithm produces better designs in the cases considered. Investigating the return on investment confirms that the multifidelity advantage is greatest in early iterations, and managing the transition to pure high-fidelity optimization is critical.",56,5

A parameterization of these loadings is proposed using model reduction techniques. The static eigenmodes of the wheel stiffness matrix that is condensed at the tire–rim interface provide a suited hierarchy of displacement or loading modes that can be sorted according to their elastic energy. A truncation of this series at a chosen order is performed to approximate any load applied to the rim. The use of cyclic symmetry is shown to lead to an efficient numerical scheme to compute these modes. This parameterization does not involve the tire modeling, which is beyond the control of aircraft wheel manufacturers. The reduced basis composed of the major eigenmodes is shown to be more compact and robust than other parameterizations based on arbitrary shape functions or tire models, and it will be further used for inverse identifications of tire–rim loadings. Moreover, this approach is generic and offers a convenient and efficient framework for arbitrary loadings.",56,5

Hypersonic waveriders are of interest in the aerospace community due to their significant aerodynamic performance improvements over conventional vehicles in the hypersonic flight regime, although designed for only a single, specific Mach number. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) morphing waverider achieves on-design waverider performance across a range of speeds by maintaining shock attachment through morphing the waverider’s lower stream surface and maintaining a rigid leading edge and top surface. A Q-DEIM sensitivity analysis is performed to define a set of actuator locations on the lower surface, which ensures that the morphing error, defined by the difference between the morphed surface and the desired surface shape, is minimized. This paper demonstrates 5- and 14-control-point cases that reduce 87% and 95% of the morphing error, respectively, for a 2-in.-wide morphing hypersonic waverider designed for wind tunnel testing across Mach numbers ranging from Mach 5 to Mach 3.5. Viscous computational fluid dynamics is used to determine the calculated morphing-error effect on the resulting aerodynamics.

Nowadays, hybrid aircraft have many potential applications as they consolidate some of the advantages of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft. Despite the abundant knowledge on designing fixed-wing aircraft, designing hybrid aircraft is a challenging process and considerable design work yet needs to be developed. Diverse hybrid aircraft preliminary design studies have focused on presenting new configurations using traditional design methods for fixed-wing aircraft and/or historical data. Although such approach is practically possible, it may lead to having either insufficient or unneeded excess engine power. Insufficient power prevents aircraft from achieving the desired performance requirements and increases transition flight time. On the other hand, excess power penalizes the design by increasing the aircraft cost and weight, resulting in diverse performance deficiencies. Thus, to obtain adequate power, wing, and rotor disc loadings, this paper presents a formal sizing methodology for hybrid propeller-driven aircraft with the necessary mathematical formulations based on integrating the performance requirements in the fixed-wing, rotorcraft, and transition flight modes. The methodology is verified by estimating the XV-15 tiltrotor sizing parameters with errors less than 3% compared with the real aircraft parameters.",56,5
