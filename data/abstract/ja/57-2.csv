0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035293,"Suppression structure is widely used to inhibit the water spray generated by aircraft tires during aircraft takeoff from or landing on a contaminated runway. The full-scale aircraft test of water spray has shown that the chine tire can effectively suppress the water spray at several low taxiing speeds, whereas its effectiveness would decrease significantly at high taxiing speeds. In this study, vertical falling test of a model chine tire into a thin water layer is conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the chine tire. The coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics/finite element method is used to analyze the mechanism of the decreasing effectiveness of chine tires at high taxiing speeds, in which the geometry of the side chine, depth of water, and taxiing speed are considered. It was found out that leakage of water is the main reason for the decreasing effectiveness; the increment of the side-chine height caused by hydroplaning at a high taxiing speed may lead to a large amount of water leaking from the length direction and further from the width direction. Based on this understanding, a new configuration of an aircraft chine tire is proposed to suppress the leakage of water and to keep the effectiveness of the side chine at a wide range of taxiing speeds.",57,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034828,"A novel robust ice detection methodology for the early detection of icing-related flight performance degradation is presented. Based on data of 75,689 flights with modern commercial airliners, a maximum aircraft fleet’s performance variation has been estimated. The evaluation of results indicates that an expected influence of icing could be clearly separated. The developed methodology is energy based and fuses aircraft body and engine influences on flight performance, which allows to reliably calculate a deviation from an available reference. This difference in flight performance is consequently used to detect an aerodynamic degradation. The novel methodology provides large capabilities and shows a good detection reliability with no false alarm even within maneuvering flight, wind shear, turbulence, and sideslip as well as for several sensor error cases. The methodology was evaluated during various simulator trials. The results show a very high potential in supporting pilots with adequate information about the current aircraft status in icing conditions.",57,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035386,"In this work a novel crashworthy cable-driven four-bar link mechanism is designed, manufactured, and tested for the development of robotic landing gear for rotorcraft. The paper will demonstrate how combining two such mechanisms through a common driving cable leads to unique advantages in the kinematics of the system and reduced loads applied to the actuators driving the system. The results on the kinematics and static force distributions are presented for such a configuration and show that, for the rotorcraft class under consideration (220–440 lb, 100–200 kg), the leg mechanism can conform to ground slopes up to . A novel design, manufacturing, and a drop testing workflow that allows for rapid design and iteration of robotic landing gear are further developed. The workflow includes the design, simulation, rapid manufacturing, and crash-survivability testing through drop testing with a two week turnaround time for a full design iteration. With regard to rapid manufacturing, this work demonstrates the use of three-dimensionally printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene mandrels for the production of fully functional carbon fiber polymer reinforced components. This paper concludes with actuation experiments to show practical performance capabilities of the final crashworthy robotic landing gear system designed.",57,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035428,"Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion offer unique possibilities to improve aircraft efficiency and performance. The potential advantages are fuel savings, lower emissions, and reduced noise. Because hybrid-electric aircraft generally apply multiple power sources, they can be designed to sustain flight if certain parts of the propulsion system fail. However, their additional degrees of freedom increase the complexity of the design process. This paper describes a methodology of an initial sizing algorithm that considers aircraft with hybrid-electric propulsion systems. A central element is a modified constraint diagram, which matches the power-to-weight ratio, wing loading, and the hybridization of power . It is coupled with a mission performance analysis that is capable of dealing with multiple energy sources and defines the mass and size of all relevant aircraft components. The modified constraint diagram also allows a visual assessment of the sizing results, and thereby greater insight into the design space.",57,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035463,"The feasibility of a solar-powered hybrid airship where lift is generated by both buoyancy and aerodynamics is investigated using aerodynamic shape optimization. The design objective is to minimize the product of envelope root chord and span (which corresponds to the size of the hangar required to house the airship), subject to constraints on the lift, the ratio of solar power produced to power consumed, the airship operational empty weight, the trim, and the static margin. Simple mass models are used to estimate the mass of airship components, including the solar array, drive train components, and envelope fabric. The optimizer has the freedom to vary the envelope section shapes, span, twist, angle of attack, and flap angle. A three-point optimization has produced a feasible envelope geometry that satisfies the design requirements at two cruise-speed operating conditions (each with a center-of-gravity location at either extreme of the design range) and one low-speed operating condition. The results indicate that such an aircraft, which could be well suited to operations in remote areas, is feasible with respect to aerodynamic efficiency. Sensitivity studies indicate that faster hybrid airships will become feasible with future improvements in solar panel irradiance.",57,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035599,"Practical aspects of frequency-domain approaches for aircraft system identification are explained and demonstrated. Topics related to experiment design, flight data analysis, and dynamic modeling are included. For demonstration purposes, simulated time-series data and simulated flight data from an F-16 nonlinear simulation with realistic noise are used. This enables detailed evaluations of the techniques and results, because the true characteristics of the data and aircraft dynamics are known for the simulated data. Analytical techniques and practical considerations are examined for the finite Fourier transform, nonparametric frequency response estimation, parametric modeling in the frequency domain, experiment design for frequency-domain modeling, data analysis and modeling in the frequency domain, and real-time calculations. Flight data from a subscale jet transport aircraft are used to demonstrate some of the techniques and technical issues.",57,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035647,"The development of faster computing power and nonintrusive experimental techniques has allowed for the advancement in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) validation and the greater understanding of aerodynamic conditions previously deemed too extreme to accurately measure. To this end, a numerical study is conducted that focuses on a propeller at yaw. Current low-order methods are reliant upon an accurate inflow profile to determine overall blade loading patterns. To improve such methods, CFD can be used to determine an initial inflow profile from which to conduct additional lower-order calculations. Therefore, to ensure that CFD is able to accurately capture yawed inflow profiles, a validation study is conducted that compares numerical simulations against experiments. Good agreement is found between the two methods, and subsequently the azimuthal variation in skin friction and induced angle of attack, as a result of the yawed conditions, is analyzed.",57,2

Computational fluid dynamics is used, on a DLR-F6 modified nacelle, to allow a more detailed look into the trailing vortices. The different trailing vortex components and regimes are presented, and the inlet vortices circulation is calculated inside and outside the engine inlet for these different regimes. The trailing and ground vortex interaction region is shown.",57,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035640,"The operational environment of aerospace products can have a big impact on their performance, and therefore it is an aspect that should be considered as early as possible in their development process. In this light, this paper presents an analysis and optimization framework that can be used in the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in order to efficiently explore the design space when considering system-of-systems (SoS) formulations. In this work, the problem is decomposed with a multilevel architecture, and it is divided into three parts, which enable a multifidelity evaluation of the SoS, constituent systems (CS), and subsystems (SS) levels. To be able to capture the collaboration between different assets at an SoS level the framework includes an in-house tool for performing agent-based simulations, whereas the specifications of each CS are analyzed through a set of basic aeronautical disciplines and a number of SS models. The framework is tested against two surveillance scenarios by considering existing as well as new UAV designs, and overall it is shown that the exploration of SoS enables to identify better capabilities; that the operational environment poses different requirements on all system levels; and that fleet tactics have a profound effect on mission performance.",57,2

This study investigates the impact of floating folding wingtips on the aircraft flight dynamics. It is found that a floating wingtip aircraft has similar handling qualities with respect to an aircraft with no wing extension.",57,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035631,"A comparison of computational and experimental ice accretions generated on three swept-wing models in the NASA Glenn Icing Research Tunnel is presented. The wind tunnel models span floor to ceiling and present the same full-scale leading edges of three different spanwise wing stations of the 65%-scale modern commercial aircraft known as the Common Research Model. Experimental ice shapes were generated on the leading edge of each model for a set of icing conditions and digitized with a three-dimensional (3-D) laser scanner, representing the ice accretions that would be obtained at their corresponding stations on the full-scale wing. Computational ice shapes were generated on the same wind tunnel models at the same flow and icing conditions of the experiment, using 3-D Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics code OVERFLOW for the flowfield, and LEWICE3D for the 3-D ice-accretion simulations. Results show large swept-wing ice accretions from high-quality experiments and state-of-the-art ice-accretion computational tools. The comparison between experiments and numerical simulations demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of the current computational tools in modeling the physics of complex 3-D flowfield and ice accretion, and indicates the need for further development and research exploration.",57,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035689,"In free air aircraft, wake vortices descend due to their mutually induced velocities. In ground proximity, however, they are hindered to descent, which increases the encounter risk significantly. Recent investigations showed that vortex decay in ground proximity can be accelerated by installing a series of plates in lines perpendicular to the flight direction in front of the runway (so-called plate lines). A previous encounter simulation study showed that the accelerated vortex decay due to the presence of a plate line leads to a reduced aircraft response during wake encounters with autopilot engaged. The present study analyzes whether the plate lines also have a positive influence on the subjective hazard perception of pilots. Flowfields generated by coupled Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulations of an A340-sized aircraft in ground effect with light crosswind and with and without plate lines were implemented in a full-flight simulator of an A320-sized aircraft for different vortex ages. Simulations with pilots in the loop also showed a reduction of the aircraft response during manual landings as well as improved subjective pilot acceptance. Plate lines are therefore considered an effective means for either increasing flight safety with current minimum separations or maintaining the same level of safety in case of reduced minimum separations.",57,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035716,"This Paper studies the instability (flutter) and poststability limit cycle oscillations of elastic shallow shells in a supersonic gas flow. In a previous paper by the authors, a nonlinear dynamic aeroelastic analysis of streamwise square curved plates was made to compare with the experimental results of Anderson. In the present Paper, computational results are presented for a much larger range of several parameters, which are important for flutter and limit cycle oscillations including both spanwise and streamwise curved plates with various aspect ratios, various boundary conditions, and the effects of static pressure and in-plane mechanical loadings. No previous study has included such a wide range of parameters and parameter values. Von Kármán shallow shell theory, a modal expansion along with the Galerkin method, and the piston theory aerodynamic model for supersonic/hypersonic flow are employed to obtain these results.",57,2
