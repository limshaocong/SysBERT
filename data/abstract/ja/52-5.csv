However, in the absence of detailed evaluations, its potential remains uncertain. As an initial contribution, this work presents a point design study for a specification chosen to maximize aerodynamic efficiency, via large wingspan and low sweepback. The resulting aircraft carries 220 passengers over a range of 9000 km at Mach 0.67 and has a lift-to-drag ratio of 60.9, far in excess of conventional passenger transports. However, its overall effectiveness is compromised by a high empty-to-payload weight ratio and, because of the huge discrepancy between cruise and climb-out thrust requirements, a poor engine efficiency. As a result, it has a much less marked fuel-consumption advantage (11.4–13.9 g per passenger kilometer, compared to 14.6) over a conventional competitor designed, using the same methods, for the same mission. Both weight ratio and engine efficiency could be improved by reducing aspect ratio, but at the cost of an aerodynamic efficiency penalty. This conflict, which has not previously been recognized, is inherent to the laminar-flying-wing concept and may undermine its attractiveness.",52,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032431,"In this paper, a modified cost function is proposed in order to achieve the maximum noise attenuation using a set of secondary sources for a harmonically excited sound field. The modified cost function drives the error signal to the optimally attenuated sound field instead of minimizing the squared pressure. Moreover, changing the value to which the error signals must be driven allows change of the control strategy from global to local. The modified cost function requires the knowledge of the attenuated sound field, which is a condition that is well suited to narrowband noises, as is the case of turboprops. A numerical example of the application of the cost function is carried out using a finite element model/boundary element model of a real turboprop, with the goal of minimizing the interior sound field in the cabin to about . A maximum averaged attenuation of 7 dB at blade-passage frequencies is achieved using six secondary sources and six error sensors. Besides, when the same control system is tuned to achieve local control around the head of a seated crew member, 11 dB of attenuation is achieved.",52,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032861,"An initial design of a morphing wingtip for a regional jet aircraft is developed and evaluated. The adaptive wingtip concept is based upon a chiral-type internal structure, enabling controlled cant angle orientation, camber, and twist throughout the flight envelope. A baseline turbofan aircraft configuration model is used as the benchmark to assess the device. Computational fluid dynamics based aerodynamics are used to evaluate the required design configurations for the device at different points across the flight envelope in terms of lift/drag and bending moment distribution along the span, complemented by panel-method-based gust load computations. Detailed studies are performed to show how the chiral structure can facilitate the required shape changes in twist, camber, and cant. Actuator requirements and limitations are assessed, along with an evaluation of the aerodynamic gains from the inclusion of the device versus power and weight penalties. For a typical mission, it was found that savings of around 2% in fuel weight are possible using the morphing wingtip device. A similar reduction in weight due to passive gust load alleviation is also possible with a slight change of configuration.",52,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032698,"The formation and accretion of ice on the leading edge of a wing can be detrimental to airplane performance. Complicating this reality is the fact that even a small amount of uncertainty in the shape of the accreted ice may result in a large amount of uncertainty in aerodynamic performance metrics (e.g., the stall angle of attack). The main focus of this work concerns using the techniques of polynomial chaos expansions to quantify icing uncertainty much more quickly than traditional methods (e.g., Monte Carlo). First, we present a brief survey of the literature concerning the physics of wing icing, with the intention of giving a certain amount of intuition for the physical process. Next, we give a brief overview of the background theory of polynomial chaos expansions. Finally, we compare the results of Monte Carlo simulations to polynomial-chaos-expansion-based uncertainty quantification for several different airfoil-icing scenarios. The results are in good agreement and confirm that polynomial chaos expansion methods are much more efficient for the canonical airfoil icing uncertainty quantification problem than Monte Carlo methods.",52,5

A probabilistic cost model is developed that explicitly models performance cost along with quality and manufacturing costs to optimize manufacturing tolerances for damage-tolerant aircraft structures. The tolerance optimization is demonstrated for the design of a wing spar with fastener holes. The advantage of including performance cost is illustrated by comparing to an optimum found by ignoring the performance cost, showing substantial change in the optimum tolerance and total cost. The random aspect of quality cost is illustrated using measured manufacturing error data collected from the wing spar assemblies of a business jet. The paper also quantifies the uncertainties in the optimum due to finite samples of measured data used for modeling manufacturing error distributions, which were found to be small due to a large number of samples.",52,5

The interaction of these high-lift systems with a propeller engine is the subject of the present work. A large and complex wind-tunnel model equipped with an active high-lift system and a powered propeller was designed, manufactured and instrumented. The wind-tunnel data show the potentials of the active high-lift system in three-dimensional wing applications. The results characterize and quantify the interactions between a propeller and a high-lift wing by using systematic variations of blowing momentum and propeller thrust.

Incorporating stochastic evaluation as a postanalysis process of deterministic optimization and imposing a safety buffer in deterministic optimization are two ways to learn and alleviate the impact of uncertainty and to avoid unexpected outcomes. This work presents a third and direct way to take uncertainty into consideration during the optimization. The impact of uncertainty was incorporated into cost evaluations when searching for the optimal solutions. The controller intervention count was computed using a heuristic model and served as another stochastic cost in addition to total delay. Costs under uncertainty were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. The Pareto fronts that contained a set of solutions were identified, and the tradeoff between delays and controller intervention count was shown. Solutions that shared similar delays but had different intervention counts were investigated. The results showed that optimization under uncertainty could identify compromise solutions on Pareto fonts, which is better than deterministic optimization with extra safety buffers. It helps decision makers reduce controller intervention while achieving low delays.",52,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032941,"The optimal design of a compound helicopter comprised of counterrotating coaxial rotors, a propeller, and optionally a fixed wing is investigated. The blade geometry, azimuthal blade pitch inputs, optimal shaft angle (rotor angle of attack), and division of propulsive and lifting forces among the components that minimize the total power for a given flight condition are determined. The optimal design problem is cast as a variational statement that minimizes the sum of induced and viscous power losses for a prescribed lift, propulsive force, and vehicle trim condition. The rotor, propeller, and wing geometry and control inputs are related to the far-field circulation through a lifting-line model that accounts for experimentally or computationally determined nonlinear lift and drag polars. The variational statement is discretized using a vortex lattice wake, and the resulting nonlinear constrained optimization problem is solved via Newton iteration. Results show that varying the prescribed propulsive force of the system affects the optimal shaft angle and rotor design, that higher harmonic control reduces the total vehicle power loss (inefficiency) in high-speed flight by as much as 15%, and that imposing a maximum allowable lateral lift offset can greatly increase the power loss of the coaxial rotors.",52,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032964,"In this paper, a sensitivity-based updating method is proposed to reduce the discrepancies between the finite-element model representation of a structure and its experimental counterpart, thus allowing engineers the use of such numerical representation for structural modification prediction, dynamic model synthesis, aeroelastic analysis, and system qualification. The proposed method iteratively minimizes a residual vector of correlation functions, defined on the frequency response functions, to find the mismodeled regions of the finite-element model through the identification of the unknown vector of the updating parameters. The approach provides an enhanced formulation of the Bayesian-based least-square solution technique and a proper numerical relaxation method, thus allowing the updated finite-element model to go beyond the dynamic equivalence with the experimental findings, that is the increase in the correlation between the corresponding modal parameters, by identifying updating parameters that well represent the physical properties of the structure under investigation. A formulation of the weighting matrices that takes into account the uncertainty of the experimental data and the use of the L-curve criterion to numerically relax the solution are presented in the paper. Results from both numerical analyses and experimental investigations are reported to validate the proposed approach and show its robustness.",52,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032967,"Continuous descent arrival (CDA) procedures provide time and fuel savings, and reduce the noise impact of aircraft operations near airports. To date, these procedures have been designed to limit the performance envelopes to achieve trajectory commonality. In this paper, the performance bounds of CDA procedure via multiphase optimal vertical trajectory generation problems with respect to two performance indices—flight time and fuel consumption—have been investigated. The optimal CDA vertical profile is first divided into two segments: the cruise segment before the top of descent (TOD) and the descent segment from the TOD. Then, the second segment is further subdivided based on flap setting and speed constraints. Finally, the resulting multiphase optimal control problem is solved using a pseudospectral method. Two different types of aircraft, B737-500 (light) and B767-400 (heavy), are used in a numerical study, and the optimal CDA trajectories of the two types are compared with a typical vertical navigation (VNAV) CDA trajectory used in CDA applications at several airports. Then, the utility of suboptimal VNAV CDA trajectories that can be created with known flight management system (FMS) VNAV descent modes is explored, and thereby enabling onboard calculation in the FMS via the sensitivity analysis that is performed with various wind conditions.",52,5

The focus of the work addressed in this paper is to validate the vibroacoustic analysis methods implemented in a multi-objective design optimization framework, EBF3PanelOpt. The stiffened test panels with six stiffeners have been designed using EBF3PanelOpt for turbulent boundary-layer excitation. To build the confidence in finite-element models, free-vibration tests of the manufactured stiffened panels are also performed. The excited experimental mode shape and eigenfrequencies match quite well with the finite element analysis results for the free-vibration test. A medium-density fiberboard and aluminum frame is used to clamp the stiffened panels in the Structural Acoustics Loads and Transmission loss window. Because of strong coupling of the stiffened test panels with the frame, a finite-element model of the stiffened panels with frame is developed. To capture the effect of the bolted joints in the test setup, bush elements with optimal values of rotational and translational stiffnesses are used. Measurements are also performed to estimate the damping in the stiffened panels with the frame. The numerical prediction of sound radiation from and transmission loss of stiffened panels is in fair agreement with the measured values for both the panels.",52,5

A Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics methodology is validated against detailed experimental data for a junction flow. Computational fluid dynamics results for a wing with a leading-edge strake (an aerodynamic surface designed to reduce flow separation, thereby reducing aircraft drag) are presented, and the effects of scaling this strake are explored. The effectiveness of the strake on a swept wing is compared to the same for a straight wing. Finally, the results from this parametric study are successfully applied to sizing a leading-edge strake for a commercial transport aircraft. It is demonstrated that a systematic approach, starting with a simple, validated model and building up to a realistic aircraft application, can build confidence in computational fluid dynamics results.",52,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032986,"The use of various robust optimization methods to solve engineering problems with environmental parameter uncertainty was investigated. Comparisons were made between a novel multi-objective-based robust optimization formulation and conventional robust regularization-based and aggregation-based methods. The results, performance, and philosophies of each method are discussed. A hypersonic vehicle design problem was used as a test bed for the methods presented here. A focus was put on studying the effect of uncertain roughness-induced boundary-layer transition locations on vehicle controllability. The robust regularization results show that a flat wedgelike vehicle design is best for a worst-case scenario, whereas a pyramidal-shaped vehicle design minimizes the expected detrimental effects on vehicle controllability. The analysis proved that the multi-objective robust optimization method was able to identify these two types of results within an overall set of results while also capturing tradeoffs within the design space.",52,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032987,"This study proposes a new method of conflict management in air traffic control that ensures a safe distance between aircraft while minimizing the workload for sector controllers. When an aircraft approaches a sector, the proper entry point is determined based on the concept of a complexity map. Using detailed information on how the traffic responds to an entering aircraft provided by the complexity map, its entry point can be modified to minimize the conflicts inside the sector. To compute the complexity map efficiently, the reachable entry points on the sector boundary are defined considering the maneuverability of the entering aircraft. Next, the variance quadtree algorithm is utilized to construct a grid of the complexity map in a coarse-to-fine manner. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by numerical simulations.",52,5

The wind-tunnel model was fabricated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in consultation with NASA Langley Research Center and AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop committee members. The static aerodynamic forces and surface pressure distributions on the wing of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency model were measured at a relatively low Reynolds number of due to tunnel capability limitations, where boundary-layer transition was simulated using optimized roughness. Measured data were compared with those of wind-tunnel tests of the Common Research Model obtained from NASA Langley Research Center’s National Transonic Facility as well as computational fluid dynamics predictions, both at a Reynolds number of . The comparison among these datasets required data normalization to the designed shape aligned at a reference condition, because the wing deformation of the wind-tunnel models deformed due to the dynamic pressure and the Reynolds number was different between the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the National Transonic Facility tests. In this paper, the normalization procedures, in addition to basic wind-tunnel corrections, are proposed and the corrected results are examined.",52,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032993,"This paper numerically investigates the ditching characteristics of the NACA TN 2929 model. In the simulation method, the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation and realizable turbulence model are solved by the finite volume method; the volume-of-fluid method is used to capture the water–air interface; the six-degree-of-freedom model and the global-moving-mesh method are used to deal with the relative motion between the water and the object. Global moving mesh is a new dynamic-mesh method, which is proposed to simulate water-entry problems. In global moving mesh, the whole computational domain and boundaries move together with the object to avoid the high computational expense and low-quality mesh in the traditional mesh-deformation method. This numerical method is applied to simulate the water impact of a two-dimensional cylinder in free fall, and the results show a good agreement with the experimental data. The effect of each aerodynamic part of the NACA TN 2929 model on the ditching behavior is studied in detail, and the results show that aerodynamic loads cannot be ignored when analyzing the ditching motion of the aircraft.",52,5

The design is carried out on a comprehensive finite state aeroservoelastic model, including sensor units and actuator transfer functions, and verified by taking into account saturated control positions, rates, and hinge moments. The controller is designed within a quadratic optimal framework, through a second-order Hessian-based optimization algorithm, exploiting block diagonal Schur transformations of the closed-loop state equations and performance weightings. An accurately chosen worst discrete gust and a reference flight condition provide a baseline design, which is significantly effective in alleviating continuous turbulence loads. Such a reference design proves itself robust enough to alleviate atmospheric loads over the complete flight envelope and is eventually further improved and robustified through a simple bilinear algebraic scheduling.",52,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033012,"Typical missions of micro aerial vehicles include remote sensing tasks in confined spaces, which limit wingspans and restrict maneuvering. Under these conditions, loiter may be limited by reduced endurance brought about by the increased power needs that may accompany wingspan and turning radius restrictions. A theoretical study was therefore performed with the primary purpose to explore aircraft configurations that are more suitable for such constrained flight domains. The theoretical performance model used for this investigation is based on a higher-order potential flow method that uses a table–lookup routine for profile drag prediction and section-lift adjustments for stall prediction. The model considers the increased lift needs during banked flight. Based on this flight performance model, parametric sweeps and multi-parameter gradient-based optimizations were applied to explore those micro aerial vehicle configurations that have minimum power requirements. Typical midspan chord Reynolds numbers ranged from below 100,000 to approximately 400,000. The findings show that, based on a flight mass of 200 g, a wingspan of 0.5 m, and turning radius restricted to 3.2 m, biplane configurations have minimum power requirements that potentially lead to 30% longer endurance than their single-wing counterpart.",52,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032962,"Reduced-order modeling of the unsteady aerodynamics generated by three-dimensional flapping wings undergoing three-dimensional motion is investigated. A low-order quasi-steady model based on rotational lift and a revised version incorporating dynamic stall are compared with experimental data generated with matching kinematics. The dynamic-stall-based model in general showed the ability to produce force curves with scale and shape similar to the experimental data, capturing most salient features but not properly resolving some of the peaks and troughs that appear post-half-cycle. The rotational lift-based model in general closely resembled the static force curves at the midcycle and overestimated the salient features around the half-cycle. This varying behavior between models is due to the primary differences in the influencing factors of the rotational lift and dynamic stall terms. These differences are exploited in a combined model that shows greater agreement with the experimental data.",52,5

At low-speed conditions, three different leading-edge configurations are considered for which the spanwise leading-edge contours can be of a sharp or rounded type. In a combined approach, both numerical computations and experimental investigations are therefore conducted. On the one hand, both steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are applied to compute numerical results for all three different leading-edge configurations. On the other hand, wind-tunnel experiments are performed for the reference configuration to study the overall aerodynamic characteristics. It turns out that the agreement between the numerics and experiment is very good. Depending on the chosen leading-edge contours, the numerical analyses show a different vortex formation on the SAGITTA diamond-wing configuration, which results in diverse flow topologies. Both the flow topologies and the characteristics of the aerodynamic coefficients are discussed in detail for the three analyzed configurations. Due to the 12% relative thickness airfoil, vortex formation takes place only at sharp leading-edge segments, but not for rounded leading-edge contours. Despite diverse flow topologies, however, the resulting effects on global performance regarding lift and pitching-moment characteristics are found to be only small for the regarded configurations.",52,5

The approach introduces the effect of the postimpact droplets by successive solutions of the conservation equations. Two models have been selected to identify the droplet splashing and bouncing conditions, and to provide initial conditions for the reinjected water. The method has been applied to droplet impingement in Supercooled Large Droplet conditions on clean and iced NACA 23012 geometries, as well as the MS(1)-0317 airfoil, and the results have been compared to experimental data. Good agreement is observed for both impingement limits and collection efficiency.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033020,"Variability in noise levels for flyovers of the same aircraft type can be as large as 12 dB, hampering noise assessment around airports. The variable atmosphere (affecting the acoustic propagation) and variations in the aircraft emitted noise are considered as the two main contributors to the noise level variability. This paper presents two experiments aimed at quantifying these contributions. First, the atmospheric contribution was determined with a loudspeaker (100 m height) sending signals to microphones on the ground, indicating a sound level variability of less than 2 dB. Second, noise levels from Boeing 737 flyovers (landings) were measured with an acoustic camera. The observed noise level variability was 6–8 dB. The acoustic camera imaging capabilities eliminated variations due to ground reflections and ambient noise, and identified the turbofan engines as the dominant noise source. Assuming the two contributions to be independent statistical processes, with the atmosphere contributing 2 dB maximally, it is concluded that the total noise level variability (6–8 dB) as measured for the flyovers was entirely due to the source. Correlating the engine noise levels to the fan rotational speed (from the spectrograms) shows that variations in engine setting explain over 70% of the observed total noise level variation.",52,5

A method for aircraft takeoff simulation is presented and validated using actual data of a passenger aircraft. Using that method, a series of single-objective as well as multi-objective optimizations was performed to find the optimum runway shape for different objectives: minimizing the produced during takeoff, maximizing the aircraft takeoff weight, and minimizing the runway construction cost, while achieving the first two objectives. The results of the optimizations showed that, for a Boeing 747-400 class aircraft, about 250 kg reduction in the produced during a takeoff can be achieved using a curved runway with the height of 60 m and the length of 3 km.

26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033056,"The nexus of advanced manufacturing methods, computer-aided design tools, and modern structural-analysis software has enabled the design and fabrication of structurally complex wing structures with unique features. This is particularly true for small unmanned aircraft, in which discrete structural hinges can easily be integrated into the overall vehicle design. This paper examines the use of discrete structural hinges for tailoring the low-frequency flight dynamics of the vehicle. For sufficiently soft discrete structural hinges, substantial coupling between flexible and rigid modes occurs, leading to the potential to modify the flight dynamic behavior through structural flexibility. Using a multibody flight dynamics simulation tool with a nonlinear lifting-line aerodynamic representation, different structural-hinge elastic properties, orientation, and location on the aircraft are examined. The results for a small unmanned aircraft indicate that flexibility mostly affects the longitudinal modes and associated handling qualities of the vehicle. Changes in the short-period and phugoid modes due to flexibility caused by a set of discrete structural hinges are often antagonistic. A structural-hinge stiffness above a certain critical value tends to improve short-period flying qualities; below this value, the short-period flying qualities degrade. In addition to the stiffness characteristics of the discrete structural hinge, orientation of the hinge has a significant effect on flight dynamics. Orienting the structural hinge to produce pitch–flap coupling can triple the short-period-mode damping, which could improve a nominally Level 3 rated aircraft to a Level 1 rated aircraft.",52,5
