0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032503,"Future air transportation demand forecasts suggest that environmental concerns such as noise will be exacerbated beyond their current level. Although detailed airport noise modeling with tools such as the integrated noise model and the Federal Aviation Administration’s Aviation Environmental Design Tool are available, these software require relatively long setup and run times due to the number of inputs available to the user and the general fidelity level of the models. A rapid, flexible, and more simplified method that reduces the input variables to a critical few and can provide results in minutes is desired to evaluate fleet-level metrics with respect to new technologies or forecasted changes in demand. Current lower-fidelity methods only calculate a change in contour area due to changes within the overall fleet composition. These methods cannot account for the shape of the contour. This paper presents a rapid airport noise computation model that leverages the fidelity of detailed models. By performing generic aircraft operations upfront, events can be rapidly recombined later to perform trades of various noise mitigating strategies. By moving the detailed noise modeling “offline” through simplifying assumptions, the fidelity of detailed models can be channeled upstream in the decision-making process. The increased speed of the model enables multiple fleet-level analyses. Verification and validation results show agreement benchmarked against integrated noise model equivalents when model assumptions are obeyed. Comparison to detailed integrated noise model equivalents when model assumptions are violated introduces certain errors, but the model retains contour area accuracy, through the basic capture of contour shape.",52,3

An wing using a S8036 section was tested at and 150,000. Taper ratio was varied from 1 down to 0.2 in 0.2 increments. An analytic prediction method as well as extended numerical lifting line theory incorporating nonlinear section data was implemented to compare with experiment. The experimental results indicated a weak dependence of peak lift to drag ratio on taper ratio for both Reynolds numbers. Surface flow visualization showed the presence of a large laminar transitional bubble on the upper wing surface. The relative extent of the bubble was observed to increase towards the tip region for tapered planforms. Agreement between theory and experiment in terms of lift and drag estimation was good. Planform optimization using the extended numerical lifting line theory indicated that at the test conditions and using the selected airfoil section, a planform that differs from straight taper or elliptic may be most efficient.",52,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032595,"A novel approach to passive propeller blade pitch variation is investigated. To effect passive pitch changes, the propeller blades are allowed to pivot freely about a radial axis, and aerodynamic pitching moments are tailored to give favorable blade pitch angles over a wide range of advance ratios. Computational modeling of the system indicated that a large expansion of the efficient operating envelope is possible, compared to a fixed-pitch propeller. Wind-tunnel experiments corroborated the computational results and demonstrated that the propeller maintained near-peak efficiency by passively adjusting blade pitch angles by over 15 deg to the match changing advance ratio. The passive variable-pitch propeller was then successfully demonstrated in flight on an unmanned aerial vehicle. Using tailored aerodynamics in place of active control allows this performance improvement to be realized at a fraction of the weight and complexity of a traditionally actuated variable-pitch propeller. The concept enables the benefits to be realized on platforms for which a traditional constant-speed variable-pitch propeller is not viable, such as on small general aviation aircraft or on unmanned platforms.",52,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032645,"The purpose of the current study is to identify key parameters and provide reasonable guidelines for the design of an efficient route structure in the extended terminal airspace area under dense air traffic flows. First, various scheduling algorithms, including a first-come/first-served and mixed-integer linear programming, are compared in terms of efficiency and optimality of scheduling performance. To further improve the efficiency of the scheduling algorithms, heuristics based on the first-come/first-served and genetic algorithms are adopted and quickly predetermine the aircraft sequences at the scheduling point. Subsequently, a dynamic planning framework is constructed to provide a more practical scheduling strategy for realistic operation, and it effectively handles the dynamic situations of traffic flows under uncertainties in weather and operations. It is an integrated framework that iteratively executes a flight trajectory model and the scheduling algorithms. As a practical application of the proposed scheduling strategy to the dense terminal environment, a design of an optimal route structure is carried out where the terminal airspace is represented in Cartesian coordinates. The sensitivities of the scheduling performance with respect to the uncertainty quantification and propagation models are investigated in more general airspace topology by varying merge point locations and their numbers.",52,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032701,"The problem of estimating the characteristics of the air traffic flow in the terminal area is considered. The estimated parameters can be used by the traffic flow coordinators and terminal area controllers to improve their response to varying air traffic flow. The approach is based on a queuing abstraction of the arrival and departure traffic routes in the terminal area. The routes are discretized as spatial servers for enforcing Federal Aviation Administration mandated separation requirements. Particle filtering methodology is employed for estimating the time-varying queuing parameters using radar track data. By considering the waypoint crossing times and airspeed as measurements, it is shown that it is feasible to estimate the time delay and its rate at various points along the arrival/departure routes. The proposed approach is illustrated using historical radar track data. A graphic display of estimated parameters to serve as a decision-support tool for use by the terminal area traffic controllers is also illustrated.",52,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032729,"This work presents the design and validation results for a quasi-static morphing helicopter rotor blade with an adaptive tip. The adaptive tip can increase its local span by 100% while maintaining a constant chord, effectively doubling the airfoil area of the morphing section leading to an overall increase in the full rotor radius. The technology components include a morphing honeycomb-like core structure that has a Poisson’s ratio of zero as it extends and an elastomer-matrix-composite skin that is bonded to the core structure. Design analyses along with experimental validation on hardware specimens are presented. The validated model is used in a numerical optimization to design a system that will self-actuate under a rotor’s normal operating conditions. Feasibility of the design is demonstrated in terms of hardware fabrication methods and overall performance to satisfy system design goals.",52,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032740,"Under the background of increasing wake vortex problems, flight risk probabilities during wake encountering are evaluated using complex system theory and multivariate extreme value theory. First, three-dimensional extreme flight parameters required for assessing the risk are extracted using Monte Carlo simulation. The one-dimensional extreme parameters are verified to have the same distribution type of thick tail as the test data. Second, the four adaptive weight parameters copula is proposed for modeling the distributions of three-dimensional extreme parameters. The result of the fitting test shows the four adaptive weight parameters copula has higher accuracy than the other copula. Third, the flight risk probability in every corresponding grid point is evaluated by taking the four adaptive weight parameters copula to model the extreme parameters in the wake field. At last, the visual two-dimensional and three-dimensional distribution maps of flight risk probability are built, and the topology characteristics of risk distributions at different stages are analyzed. The maximum flight risk probability during wake encountering is about 13.5%. The work is an effective complement to the aircraft system safety assessment method. It also has some reference values for research on wake navigation control, risk aversion, airport safety interval improvement, environment risks visualization, and so on.",52,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032766,"Congestion is a critical issue at most hub airports. This paper tackles this problem occurring at the airport with the most passengers in Japan: Tokyo International Airport. This airport has four intersecting runways, which interfere with each other and complicate the runway operation. To increase the efficiency, the runway operation is modeled by a queueing model, which calculates the average waiting time on each runway. A simple queueing model is applied and extended to describe the complicated runway operation, and several key parameters (e.g., takeoff and landing separations) are estimated via actual data. The accuracy of the model is also validated. Using the proposed models, the arrival traffic is optimized, and it is shown that about 100 min of waiting time can be saved by appropriate runway allocation on a sample day.",52,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032805,"Fixed-wing micro aerial vehicles experience attitude control difficulties as they operate in highly turbulent environments. Previous research has identified pressure-based control as a potential approach for augmenting the performance of, or replacing, autopilots reliant on inertial sensors. However, implementation requires an in-depth understanding of the correlation that exists between oncoming gusts and wing surface-pressure variations. This paper investigates the variation of correlation along a representative micro aerial vehicle wing chord and wingspan between upstream flow pitch angle variation and wing surface-pressure variation. Atmospheric turbulence was replicated within the controlled environment of a wind tunnel using planar grids that generated a turbulence intensity of 12.6%. Despite the unsteady nature of the pressure field, it was discovered that high correlation is evident in the vicinity of the leading edge. Thus, a few optimally placed sensors can be used for a pressure-based attitude control system for micro aerial vehicles.",52,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032828,"Numerical investigations into the aerodynamic performance and the mutual aerodynamic interactions between the rotors and a fuselage were conducted for a multirotor unmanned-aerial-vehicle configuration. For this purpose, time-accurate unsteady-flow calculations were performed by using a three-dimensional unstructured-mesh flow solver. The fluid motion was assumed to be governed by the three-dimensional, incompressible, Navier–Stokes equations. To handle the relative motion of the rotor blades, an overset-mesh technique was adopted. Numerical simulations were performed for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle with fuselage in hover and in forward flight. To examine the effect of flow direction in forward flight, both diamond and square formations of the rotors were considered. It was observed that, in the case of hovering flight, the mutual aerodynamic interactions of the rotors induce slightly higher inflow than an isolated single rotor, and produce unsteady fluctuating-thrust variations. When the vehicle is in forward flight, the tip vortices and the downwash flow from upstream rotors strongly affect those at downstream by locally changing the thrust behavior. The mutual aerodynamic interactions between rotors also result in increased pitching and rolling moments of the vehicle. It was recommended that aerodynamic interactions between multiple rotors should be considered when designing the stability and attitude-control algorithms of multirotor unmanned-aerial-vehicle configurations.",52,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032835,"A standard descent procedure with a fixed flight-path angle is proposed to improve trajectory predictability for arriving small jets in the transition airspace into congested terminal area. Three candidate strategies for selecting fuel-efficient and flyable descent flight-path angles are proposed. The three strategies vary in operational complexity and fuel-burn merits. To mitigate variation of wind among flights, the two simpler strategies are adapted to airport, directions of arrival, and time. Three major U.S. airports with different degrees of wind variation and disparate arrival traffic flows are analyzed. Results show that, when compared to the simple airport–static adaptation, the finest adaptation of the simpler strategies recover up to 50–75% of the extra fuel burn relative to the minimum-fuel strategy. Wind variation, descent altitude restrictions, arrival directions, and fleet composition all affect the fuel efficiency of the simple strategies. Tradeoffs between fuel burn and planned speed-brake usage in the choice of the flight-path angle are discussed. Fuel efficiency of simple strategies for the entire national airspace in the United States is estimated. Considerations and implications for air navigation service providers are discussed.",52,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032883,"Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational-fluid-dynamics analysis was conducted to study the low-speed stall aerodynamics of a business jet’s swept wing modified with a laminar-flow wing glove. The stall aerodynamics of the gloved wing were analyzed and compared with the unmodified wing for the flight speed of 120 kt and altitude of 2300 ft above mean sea level. A polyhedral finite-volume unstructured Navier–Stokes computational-fluid-dynamics code was used in the analysis. This computational-fluid-dynamics code was first validated for wing stall predictions using the wing–body geometry from the First AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics High-Lift Prediction Workshop. It was found that the computational-fluid-dynamics code under consideration can produce results that are within the scattering of other computational-fluid-dynamics codes considered at the workshop. In particular, the polyhedral computational-fluid-dynamics code was able to predict wing stall for the AIAA wing–body geometry to within 1 deg of angle of attack as compared to benchmark wind-tunnel test data. Computational-fluid-dynamics results show that the addition of the laminar-flow wing glove causes the gloved wing to stall much earlier than the unmodified wing. Furthermore, the gloved wing has a different stall characteristic than the clean wing, with no sharp lift dropoff at stall for the gloved wing.",52,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033176,"Some contrail avoidance options are critically analyzed. These options include the use of altitude flexibility and go-around. It is demonstrated that long-range commercial airplanes powered by high bypass turbofan engines have a vertical flexibility of up to 3,000 ft (30 flight levels) for a fuel penalty of 1%. This penalty can be recovered by adjusting the cruise Mach number. However, there are technical difficulties in implementing this option, due to air traffic constraints and safety issues. Avoidance proposals that involve a go-around are impractical, not least for the extension of the flight time, which bears additional operating costs. A sensitivity analysis is shown to indicate that single-event forecasts may be imprecise and that contrail events cannot be costed by precise methods. The paper concludes with the statement that long-term contrail effects (years or decades) obtained by single-flight procedure changes (if allowed at all) cannot be reliably predicted. Simple prediction methods cannot be used for long-term forecasting.",52,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033284,"The concept that a structure is capable of producing buoyancy using an internal vacuum rather than a gas dates back to the 1600s, but material technology has restricted the construction of such concepts for common geometries, such as the sphere. Different and often complex geometries compensate for the lack of light materials that provide the stiffness and strength needed. Therefore, this research looks at a lighter-than-air vehicle in the form of an icosahedral frame/skin configuration using nonlinear finite element analysis in order to determine the structural response of such a vehicle, its capacity to sustain a vacuum with both material technology that exists today and in the near future, and its buoyancy characteristics. The structural response is characterized with large displacements, where membrane behavior dominates the icosahedral skin response, generating geometric stiffening in the overall structure. It is shown that those displacements have minimal effect in the structure’s buoyancy, with no more than 4% reduction. Overall, the nonlinear analysis of the icosahedral structure provided tangible background on its behavior and the lighter-than-air vehicle applicability. It is feasibly possible to actually manufacture this type of vehicle in the very near future, depending upon newer materials with more advanced strength.",52,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032930,"The current approach used to apply uncertainty intervals to balance estimated loads is based on the root mean square error from calibration. Using the root mean square error, a constant interval is applied around the estimated load and it is expected that a predetermined percentage of the check-loads applied fall within this constant uncertainty interval. However, this approach ignores additional sources of uncertainty and assumes constant uncertainty regardless of the load combination and magnitude applied to the balance. Rigorous prediction interval theory permits varying interval widths but fails to account for the additional error sources that are unrelated to the mathematical modeling. An engineered solution is proposed that combines prediction interval theory and the need to account for the additional sources of uncertainty from calibration and check loading. Results from a case study using the in-situ load system show improved probabilistic behavior in terms of uncertainty interval capture percentage when compared with the current root mean square error method.",52,3

This study focuses on large-amplitude forced oscillations of a benchmark commercial aircraft configuration. Existing models are modified to describe the unsteady aerodynamic forces on the aircraft up to stall range. Steady-state and periodically forced unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation data are employed to calibrate the model parameters. The results of the reduced-order models are in good overall agreement with those observed in the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations.",52,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032905,"The increasing demand for intelligence and surveillance missions has led to the novel use of aircraft (especially unmanned aerial vehicles). Rather than flying long distances or loitering, a fleet of aircraft will maintain a permanent presence at a remote location. Two questions arise: at what distance can this presence be maintained, and at what aerodynamic efficiency shall the aircraft fly during the transits? The Breguet equations for range and endurance provide a preliminary formula for the “range for continuous coverage”, in which the aerodynamic coefficients for both transit phases appear. The optimization of these coefficients provides remarkable results: for a given propulsion type and number of aircraft, the lift coefficient for the optimal range for continuous coverage is always a constant multiple of the lift coefficient for the best range (e.g., the best continuous coverage for two jet aircraft is of the best range ).",52,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032839,"Ice accretion on the surface of an electrothermal anti-icing system around a rotorcraft engine air intake was investigated on the basis of computational and experimental methods. A compressible Navier–Stokes–Fourier computational fluid dynamics code was used to determine the fully three-dimensional flowfield around the inlet of the engine and the environment control system. Three-dimensional droplet trajectory and ice accretion codes based on the Eulerian approach, DROP3D and ICE3D modules of FENSAP-ICE, were used to calculate the collection efficiency and ice shape on the surface of an engine air intake. Furthermore, an experimental study using an icing wind tunnel was conducted to validate the computational predictions of ice accretion on the surface of the electrothermal anti-icing system in heat-off and heat-on modes. It is shown that the general shape and range of ice accretion obtained by numerical calculations are in close agreement with experimental observation. In particular, two features of glaze ice formation identified from computational results, the upper parts of the intake with the largest ice accretion and the narrow region between these parts showing relatively small ice accumulation, were confirmed in the experimental study.",52,3

The operational conditions experienced by the airplanes are studied as well as the magnitude of the vertical loads. The airplanes are flown in four different types of missions in U.S. Forest Service operation. Data from 1853 flights and seven aircraft are presented. Spectra are shown for gust and maneuver loads, separated using the two-second rule. These are given for the entire flight for various mean sea-level altitudes. In addition, the combined loads are presented and compared to existing data and Federal Aviation Regulation 23. It is shown that these aircraft are operated well within their design envelope. It is demonstrated that, although gust loads are comparable to those outlined in Federal Aviation Regulation 23, the maneuver load frequencies far exceed those of typical airframe use. Although these results do not warrant changes to Federal Aviation Regulation 23, they highlight the need for modified airframe maintenance and inspection procedures as well as the estimated airframe fatigue life.",52,3
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033283,"A compact flight dynamics model of a kite is developed by using Lagrangian formulation. The lengths of the three ropes of the bridle and the tether of the kite depend on time and are used to implement an open-loop control scheme of the kite system. By imposing simple time-periodic control laws, two pumping strategies for wind-energy generation are explored. Periodic trajectories of the system and their stability properties (Floquet characteristic multipliers) are computed numerically. As the amplitudes of the figure-eight paths are increased, the system becomes more efficient but less stable. A cyclic-fold bifurcation is detected for a very large lateral displacement of the kite. The impact of the control-law parameters on the generated power, including the period and the amplitude, is investigated. The results indicate that a correct design of the control could provide an optimal energy-generation system and a robust scheme to exploit high-altitude winds.",52,3
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032983,"Numerical and experimental analyses of the aerodynamic performance of a triangular airfoil in low-Reynolds-number compressible flow are performed. This airfoil is one of the candidates for propeller blades on a possible future Martian air vehicle design. Based on past experimental studies conducted in the Mars Wind Tunnel at Tohoku University, this airfoil is known to exhibit nonlinear lift behavior. In the present study, direct numerical simulations of low-Reynolds-number compressible flow over a spanwise periodic triangular airfoil are conducted to identify the source of nonlinear lift. The numerical results reveal that the source of the nonlinear aerodynamic behavior is the lift enhancement provided by the large leading-edge vortex generated. For compressible low-Reynolds-number flow, the wake structure becomes elongated, causing the nonlinear lift enhancement to appear at higher angles of attack compared to the case of incompressible flow.",52,3
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033160,"A new low-boom target generation approach is presented that allows the introduction of a trim requirement during the early conceptual design of supersonic aircraft. The formulation provides an approximation of the center of pressure for an aircraft configuration with a reversed equivalent area matching a low-boom equivalent area target. The center of pressure is approximated from a surrogate lift distribution that is based on the lift component of the classical equivalent area. The assumptions of the formulation are verified to be sufficiently accurate for a supersonic aircraft of high fineness ratio through three case studies. The first two quantify and verify the accuracy and the sensitivity of the surrogate center of pressure corresponding to shape deformation of lifting components. The third verification case shows the capability of the approach to achieve a trim state while maintaining the low-boom characteristics of a previously untrimmed configuration. Finally, the new low-boom target generation approach is demonstrated through the early conceptual design of a demonstrator concept that is low-boom feasible, trimmed, and stable in cruise.",52,3

Short segments of data were sequentially processed to enable real-time estimation, and variations on the algorithm were used to expedite convergence from arbitrary starting values of the unknown model parameters. The method was applied to flight-test data to correct the data for systematic instrumentation errors. Results showed that the method produced accurate estimates of the data-compatibility correction parameters at a rate of 0.5 Hz.

23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033021,"The Squire–Young formula is widely used to calculate profile drag in two-dimensional airfoil analyses. Although experience shows that the formula provides reasonable and accurate predictions, full Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics allows for a numerical validation of the formula. A method is presented for evaluating the Squire–Young formula from a computational fluid dynamics solution, and demonstrated for several airfoils. The agreement between profile-drag coefficients determined using the Squire–Young formula and those calculated directly from the computational fluid dynamics solution using surface integration is typically within 2–3% in the low-drag range, with error increasing at higher lift coefficients. The applicability of the underlying assumptions is discussed, and the validity of the assumed variation of shape factor and edge velocity in the wake is investigated for a symmetric airfoil at zero lift. The formula is also demonstrated as being insensitive to spurious drag that may occur due to far-field boundary conditions.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033030,"Curved or segmented approach procedures are considered beneficial for reducing or shifting the impact of aircraft noise in the approach phase of flight. Considering airports with parallel runway systems, the usage of segmented approaches, however, no longer allows simultaneous and independent approach operations according to current guidelines and therefore reduces capacity. In previous work a safety concept was developed to pave the way towards conducting independent approach operations while utilizing segmented approaches. Although the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) is by definition not part of this kind of safety concept, an important question to answer is whether the current ACAS implementation can be characterized as compatible to the proposed approach geometry. Because classical approaches towards parallel runways are already critical with respect to generating nuisance ACAS alerts, this issue might even be exacerbated due to the segmented routing. Therefore, an approach geometry-dependent critical runway spacing that will not result in nuisance ACAS alerts will be determined in this work. The obtained value can be compared to a given runway layout to determine whether ACAS may be used or should be deactivated for a given segmented approach procedure.",52,3

Various forces acting on a hydroplaning hull form have been empirically defined. Such empirical data have shown that, under a certain set of conditions, a hydroplaning hull will begin to porpoise: an instability oscillation in both the vertical direction and about the center of gravity. To investigate the porpoising motion, a shallow water flume was used. It was the first time that such a facility had been used to simulate the dynamic motion of hydroplaning hull forms.

Forces and moments were measured by a strain gauge balance, and the pressure distribution on the lee side of the model was determined by pressure-sensitive paint.

27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032858,"Wake turbulence can be experienced by aircraft when encountering the wake vortex of another aircraft. The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of the risk posed by en route wake-vortex encounters in the en route flight phase. To quantify this risk, a simulation framework has been conceived that makes use of recorded historical surveillance data and computes the wake-vortex trajectory and decay for each aircraft based on a wake-vortex model. The simulation has been validated and subsequently used to determine the probability of encountering a wake vortex in upper European airspace. The simulation results bear out that a severe wake-vortex encounter can be expected approximately once every 38 days. Three factors have been identified that contribute to the risk of encountering a wake vortex during the en route phase of flight, viz., the characteristics of the exposed or generating aircraft, the encounter geometry, and the prevailing tropopause height in the atmosphere. The combined time evolution of these three factors suggests that the en route wake-vortex encounter risk may increase in the future. Finally, both short-term and long-term mitigation measures are proposed that can potentially reduce the severity of wake-vortex encounters or even prevent their occurrence.",52,3
