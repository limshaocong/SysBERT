A wind-tunnel study of a wing-embedded lifting fan has been conducted at the Side Wind Test Facility Göttingen of DLR, German Aerospace Center in Göttingen using force, pressure, and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry techniques. The study showed that a step on the lower side of the wing in front of the lifting fan duct increases the lift-to-drag ratio of the whole model by up to 25% for all positive angles of attack. Different sizes and inclinations of the step had limited influence on the surface pressure distribution. The data indicate that these parameters can be optimized to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio. A doubling of the curvature radius of the lifting fan duct inlet lip on the upper side of the wing affected the lift-to-drag ratio by less than 1%. The lifting fan duct inlet curvature can therefore be optimized to maximize the vertical fan thrust of the rotating lifting fan during hovering without affecting the cruise flight performance with a nonrotating fan.",57,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035531,"An aeroelastic modeling capability of a flexible aircraft with gas turbine engines is developed using a computational fluid dynamics tool as an integration platform. The new modeling capability allows for the typical aeroelastic analysis to include a nonlinear dynamic model of the turbomachinery that is capable of capturing relevant gas dynamics. An example case of the aero-propulso-elastic (APE) modeling capability is explored for a supersonic transport vehicle with turbofan engines. An overview of the methodology for integrating the propulsion system and elastic vehicle is provided. This is followed by a study to explore coupling sensitivities compared against typical aeroelastic analysis. Dynamic and static vehicle responses are considered across key flight conditions and vehicle-level angles of attack, where the inclusion of the propulsion system has a 10% increase in vehicle wing tip deformations. It is found that the propulsion system is stable at various operating conditions, with structural oscillations having little impact on propulsion system performance. Perceived loudness, a key performance metric for a supersonic transport, is investigated using the APE model. Results lead to an approximately 4 dB increase in noise over a rigid body analysis that neglects the propulsion system. The greatest impacts are shown during off-nominal conditions.",57,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035609,"Hingeless proprotor whirl flutter in cruise flight is investigated using comprehensive rotorcraft analysis codes CAMRAD II and RCAS. Generic hingeless proprotor designs include conventional soft-in-plane and stiff-in-plane rotors operating at cruise tip speeds typical of existing tiltrotor systems and a rotor that exhibits higher frequencies and operates at much lower cruise tip speed than existing rotor designs. The effects of the blade elasticity, wing/pylon model, density, speed of sound, unsteady aerodynamics, and realistic airfoil tables on whirl flutter speed are examined. CAMRAD II and RCAS show consistently excellent agreement with each other for wide variations of design variables and operating conditions.",57,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035784,"Cyclic loads have a significant impact on the fatigue life of aircraft lugs. To evaluate fatigue life of aircraft lugs, an accurate calculation of fatigue life is essential. Therefore, thermal stress and loading angle are introduced to establish the numerical model. Based on Manson–Coffin and Paris formulas, an approach is developed to predict failure of aircraft lugs under thermal stress and oblique loading angle. The numerical results show reasonable agreement with available data for a straight lug with an aligned load and a tapered lug with oblique loads. The results indicate that the fatigue life of aircraft lugs decreases as the surrounding temperature or loading angle increases. The feasibility of the numerical method is verified by the oblique load case.",57,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035606,"Flying wings achieve their roll, pitch, and yaw controllability exclusively through spanwise variations of lift and drag due to the lack of an empennage. Instead of using conventional control surfaces, which increase the aerodynamic drag due to gaps and discontinuities, a morphing structure can be employed. This work considers a previously developed camber morphing flying wing, which uses 10 electromechanical actuators to achieve spanwise-varying trailing edge deflections, resulting in variations of the lift and drag distributions and generating moments around the roll, pitch, and yaw axes. To investigate the control authority of the aircraft across all flight maneuvers, a series of multi-objective aerostructural optimizations is carried out. The performance for the individual maneuvers, as well as the interaction of simultaneous roll, pitch, and yaw moments and the resulting control authority, is assessed. Because the same actuators are used for all maneuvers, a high degree of interaction has been found between the achieved rolling and yawing moments. By minimizing the additional drag with the morphing actuation, the undesired effect of adverse yaw is minimized. The results describe a possible control strategy for flying wing aircraft with optimal drag performance.",57,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035720,"Three flutter-suppression designs for a flexible flying-wing research drone are discussed, along with the modeling and flight-test results. The drone, with wing span of 10 feet, aspect ratio of almost 9, and control surfaces along the entire wing trailing edges, was developed for flight research into the modeling and control of highly elastic aircraft. The low-speed vehicle was designed to exhibit body-freedom flutter in its flight envelope. The all-important dynamic modeling of the vehicle, used for analysis and control design, is based on a mean-axis formulation and quasi-steady aerodynamics, with the nondimensional aerodynamic/aeroelastic coefficients updated from flight tests. Flutter-modeling results were found to agree with those from NASTRAN and flight tests. The three different flutter-suppression approaches include both fairly classical and multivariable methods, all fixed gains but with different architectures. The primary control-design objective was to augment the damping of the eventual flutter mode at a design condition below the open-loop flutter speed, for safety of flight, and to achieve a closed-loop flutter speed at least as high as the open-loop flutter speed. Analysis and flight tests revealed that all three designs achieved these design goals. In addition, two of these designs actually expanded the flutter boundary. The theoretical stability robustness of all three controllers at the design flight condition is quite good, but there are differences in controller complexity. Research is currently underway to further expand the flutter boundary using all three design approaches.",57,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035707,"The study presents a frequency-domain methodology for computing the structural dynamic response of an elastic aircraft to single and ripple ejections, accounting for the time variation of the inertial properties of the configuration. The frequency-domain method has the advantage of allowing for the direct use of frequency-domain unsteady aerodynamic forces without resorting to approximations for representing the aerodynamics in the time domain. Using this methodology, the study investigates how the different load sources affect the total load, which structural modes are involved in the response (using wavelet analysis), and how the time interval between ripple ejections affects the resulting loads. The study also investigates the effect of a follower ejection force on the loads. The test case of the study is a subsonic, elastic, generic unmanned aircraft carrying up to six stores on each wing.",57,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035680,"Aero-driven bleed-air (ADB) is a flow control technology that offers a unique alternative to novel aircraft concepts that are not conducive to traditional flapped control surfaces. The primary source of mechanical energy for ADB control is derived from the motion of the vehicle. Inherent pressure differences across aerodynamic surfaces are communicated by means of internal channels, with the intent of affecting the local crossflow. Effected across a large area, ADB can significantly alter the global aerodynamic forces and moments. This investigation explores the performance of large-area-distributed ADB as a roll control mechanism on a low-speed, fixed-wing air vehicle. A series of wind tunnel experiments is presented, aimed at characterizing the effects that various porosity configurations have on the lift and drag of a Clark-Y airfoil section. ADB was found to be capable of reducing the sectional lift coefficient across a broad domain of angles of attack by as much as relative to the baseline airfoil. A mathematical model for estimating the steady-state roll rate of a wing with ADB is developed. Several pore opening schedules are considered, with an emphasis on finding a nearly linear relationship between bleed level and steady-state roll rate. The selected schedule is implemented on a flight test vehicle equipped with ADB roll control effectors. Roll rates of up to were achieved in flight, and flight test data were found to validate the steady-state roll rate model. The aircraft was piloted from takeoff through landing using ADB for roll control.",57,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035710,"This work presents modal identification results for the unsteady three-dimensional flow around a wing featuring multiple trailing edge flaps. The unsteady spanwise lift distribution is modeled using the unsteady vortex lattice method, which yields a linear, time-invariant, high-order state-space model. The eigensystem realization algorithm is applied for model order reduction and modal identification, providing aerodynamic mode shapes and associated eigenvalues. The wing is considered rigid, so that the dynamic mode shapes associated with the spanwise lift distribution are purely aerodynamic. It is observed that the spatial-temporal discretization of the numerical model and flap dimensions inherently limit the number of modes that can be properly identified. Open-loop simulation results demonstrate the modal behavior of the aerodynamic system. Finally, aerodynamic mode shapes for different wing planforms are also presented for comparison. By expanding the system output (lift distribution) as a truncated superposition of aerodynamic mode shapes, a low-order multiple-input and multiple-output modal representation can be obtained, suitable for controller synthesis. Ultimately, this novel approach will be applied to gust alleviation, in order to keep a desired lift distribution profile using shape control techniques.",57,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035458,"Performance models facilitate a wide range of safety analyses in aviation. In an ideal scenario, the performance models would show inherently good agreement with the true performance of the aircraft. However, in reality, this is rarely the case: either owing to underlying simplifications or due to the limited fidelity of applicable tools or data. In such cases, calibration is required to fine-tune the behavior of the performance models. For point-mass steady-state performance models, challenges arise due to the fact that there is no obvious, unique metric or flight condition at which to assess the accuracy of the model predictions, as well as because a large number of model parameters may potentially influence model accuracy. This work presents a two-level approach to aircraft performance model calibration. The first level consists of using manufacturer-developed performance manuals for calibration, whereas the second level provides additional refinement when flight data are available. The performance models considered in this work consist of aerodynamic and propulsion models (performance curves) that are capable of predicting the nondimensional lift, drag, thrust, and torque at any given point in time. The framework is demonstrated on two representative general aviation aircraft. The demonstrated approach results in models that can predict critical energy-based safety metrics with improved accuracy for use in retrospective safety analyses.",57,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035829,"The bifurcation analysis method is used to study the high-speed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) dynamics and directional stability during the steering process on the ground. A UAV nonlinear ground taxiing dynamic model is built considering the effects of large-angle-steering motion on the interactive aerodynamic forces. The single-parameter bifurcation analysis is first conducted to study the influence of the UAV rectilinear velocity on the system stability performance. The bifurcation parameter plane is divided into several parts by the bifurcation points to analyze different kinds of UAV steering motion states. Then the analysis of the UAV loading features and the kinetic characteristics gives further insight into the instability mechanism of the system. Moreover, the dual-parameter bifurcation analysis is carried out, and the effects of the main-wheel span and the nose wheel steering angle are investigated. Results indicate that the Bautin bifurcation and the Fold-Hopf bifurcation both increase the unstable region of the UAV ground steering dynamic system.",57,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035749,"To understand time-dependent aerodynamic loads on single and tandem (fore/aft) slender cylinders translated out into the supersonic freestream from a cavity at Mach 1.5, the normal force and pitching moment are experimentally obtained via load cells. For a single long store, the measurements were conducted with two different angles of attack at several static positions and with dynamic motions. For tandem stores, the fore- and aft-positioned stores were translated both independently and simultaneously with various time delays. The single long store results had good repeatability and revealed that the fastest dynamic motions exhibited unsteady forces and moments that differed from quasi-static results. Moreover, the results from the tandem stores showed that the aft-positioned store had more favorable aerodynamic loads as compared to the front store for the static measurements. However, when stores were ejected simultaneously or with time delay, the aft-positioned store was strongly affected by the forward-positioned store and showed bifurcation on the aerodynamic loads after the shear layer.",57,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035509,"Hybrid-electric aircraft are a potential way to reduce the environmental footprint of aviation. Research aimed at this subject has been pursued over the last decade; nevertheless, at this stage, a full overall aircraft design procedure is still an open issue. This work proposes to enrich the procedure for the conceptual design of hybrid aircraft found in literature through the definition of a multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) framework aimed at handling design problems for such kinds of aircraft. The MDO technique has been chosen because the hybrid aircraft design problem shows more interaction between disciplines than a conventional configuration, and the classical approach based on multidisciplinary design analysis may neglect relevant features. The procedure has been tested on the case study of a single-aisle aircraft featuring hybrid propulsion with distributed electric ducted fans. The analysis considers three configurations (with 16, 32, and 48 electric motors) compared with a conventional baseline at the same 2035 technological horizon. To demonstrate the framework’s capability, these configurations are optimized with respect to fuel and energy consumption. It is shown that the hybrid-electric concept consumes less fuel/energy when it flies on short range due to the partial mission electrification. When one increases the design range, penalties in weight introduced by hybrid propulsion overcome the advantages of electrified mission segment: the range for which hybrid aircraft have the same performance of the reference conventional aircraft is named the “breakdown range.” Starting from this range, the concept is no longer advantageous compared to conventional aircraft. Furthermore, a tradeoff between aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency is detected, and the optimal configuration is the one that balances these two effects. Finally, multiobjective optimization is performed to establish a tradeoff between airframe weight and energy consumption.",57,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035581,"Compared with conventional unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the propulsion systems of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and short takeoff and landing (STOL) UAVs with distributed electric propulsion (DEP) are more complex. This paper analyzes the impact of VTOL and STOL requirements and of the DEP system on the takeoff mass and flight performance of UAVs. Analytical models are developed to investigate these properties of DEP VTOL and STOL UAVs. The results of the initial sizing were compared with the parameters of a DEP STOL demonstrator that was actually built. A sensitivity analysis of the design parameters of the DEP STOL UAV was carried out based on the analytical models, and the impact of key design parameters on the takeoff mass and endurance was calculated and discussed. The results show that the propulsion system mass and cable mass of the demonstrator account for 27 and 7% of the takeoff mass, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of conventional UAVs. The key design parameters are the battery energy density, mass-specific power of the motor, lift-to-drag ratio, endurance, and electric-ducted fan efficiency, of which battery energy density has reached a technological limit. The sensitivity of takeoff mass and endurance to the key design parameters varies with the level of technology available, indicating that some currently impractical configurations may perform well at the next level of technology.",57,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035733,"This Paper describes how flight simulation has been used to investigate helicopter recovery operations to the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth, the United Kingdom’s new aircraft carrier. A helicopter flight simulation environment has been developed in which the unsteady airflow over the ship has been created using full-scale computational fluid dynamics. A six-degree-of-freedom motion flight simulator has been used to conduct real-time piloted deck landings where a helicopter flight dynamics model representative of a Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk helicopter was recovered to the designated rotorcraft landing spots toward the stern of the ship. A test pilot was instructed to land the helicopter and to give workload ratings for the difficulty of the task when flying in relative winds from Ahead, and 45 deg and 90 deg from starboard. The workload ratings, along with the corresponding pilot control activity and helicopter positional accuracy, are discussed in relation to the airflow to which the helicopter was subjected. The Paper demonstrates how flight simulation could be used to support flight trials and helicopter clearance activities but also notes that real-world trials data are needed to compare with the simulations before the techniques can be beneficially deployed.",57,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035927,"The effects of bearing friction, driving speeds, and external loads on the transmission efficiency of the trailing-edge flap motion mechanism are studied through theoretical analysis and multibody dynamics simulations. The simulation results agree well with theoretical prediction. It is found that the transmission efficiency defined by moment and power shows basically similar change trends with rotation angle and reaches the maximum value at a fixed position independent of external loads, which can be attributed to the different trends of the change of energy consumed by friction and that of input energy. In addition, the transmission efficiency decreases dramatically with the increase of friction coefficient, whereas the driving speed seems to have little effect on it. A further investigation on the effects of load direction indicates an alternative way to improve the transmission efficiency by regulating the direction of the aerodynamic force.",57,4
