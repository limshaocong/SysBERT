Wind-tunnel testing was performed in which a six-axis force balance was used to measure the total aerodynamic load on wings with winglet control surfaces. Stereoscopic digital particle image velocimetry of the near-wake plane was used to show how the topology of the tip vortices changed with winglet deflection. Shifts in the location of the right tip vortex core are considered to be responsible for roll moment generation because they indicate changes in the symmetry of suction-side flow structures. All winglet deflections were observed to shift the right tip vortex core inboard, and thereby shorten the effective span of the wing. The effect of a winglet deflection may be approximated as a change in the wing aspect ratio and a lateral shift in the wing aerodynamic center. Prandtl’s lifting line theory provides a closed-form estimate for the reduction in lift caused by a winglet deflection. A geometrical argument was made to account for the induced roll moment. The right tip vortex core also shifts vertically, following the deflected wing tip. Vertical shifts in the right tip vortex result in an angle between the wing span line and a line connecting the two tip vortices. A positive angle is defined as the right tip vortex higher over the wing than the left, and it is accompanied by a positive roll moment. While in sideslip, the wing with no winglet deflection experiences a considerable roll moment as a result of a vertical and lateral shift in the two tip vortices. The articulated winglets are observed to partially mitigate these effects when the upstream winglet is actuated, and thus show promise as a direct means of disturbance rejection.",56,2

However, minimum induced drag for steady level flight is not obtained by imposing the constraints of fixed gross weight and wingspan. Because required wing-structure weight is a function of wingspan and lift distribution, there exist an optimum lift distribution and wingspan for a given weight and weight distribution that minimizes the induced drag in steady level flight. This optimum lift distribution can vary significantly from the elliptic lift distribution, depending on the design constraints. Analytic solutions for three such optimum lift distributions are presented for rectangular wings with varying sets of design constraints. These design constraints are 1) weight, maximum stress, and chord length fixed; 2) weight, maximum stress, and wing loading fixed; and 3) weight, maximum deflection, and wing loading fixed. It is shown that each of these optimum lift distributions results in lower induced drag than a fixed elliptic lift distribution for the same design constraints.",56,2

A Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver is used for aerodynamic prediction, together with conceptual-level weight and balance models. These are coupled with a gradient-based optimizer to form a multidisciplinary optimization tool. Two HWB configurations are investigated. The first uses winglets with winglet-mounted rudders for lateral control, whereas the second uses centerbody-mounted fins with rudders. Longitudinal control is achieved with one centerbody elevator and six wing-mounted elevons. The designs are optimized for a combination of minimum/maximum takeoff weight and cruise drag. The ability of the designs to maintain lateral trim with one engine inoperative at a specified minimum control speed and to achieve a given rotational acceleration at a specified rotation speed forms the off-design S&C constraints. Additional constraints at cruise ensure trim and a required static margin. In addition to a classical HWB shape, a narrower cabin layout is also considered, which provides an improved performance. The required S&C requirements are found to be attainable using both configurations, with the fin-based control having a small performance advantage. The narrow-centerbody configuration is found to provide superior performance over the classical configuration.",56,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034875,"This Paper presents a coupled vortex particle method–computational fluid dynamics solver. The vortex particle method is used to prevent dissipation of the vortex structure on coarse computational fluid dynamics meshes. Implementation of the approach uses the split velocity method that specifies the fluid velocity as the sum of the induced vortex particle velocity and a remaining velocity. Dissipation of the vortex velocities on coarse meshes is removed, and the computational fluid dynamics equations solved for the remaining velocity have a form identical to those for a moving mesh, but with additional source terms. The coupled solver is demonstrated on a selection of two-dimensional test cases, and the results are compared to the solutions of the computational fluid dynamics solver on its own using a coarse mesh and a fine mesh. It is shown that the coupled solver preserves the vortices on a coarse mesh and is computationally more efficient than using the fine mesh.",56,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034929,"A low-speed wind tunnel investigation was conducted to characterize the performance of plain and Gurney flaps on a 55 deg sweep delta wing. The geometry of the plain trailing-edge flaps was varied in terms of their length and setting angle. The height of the Gurney flaps was altered. Both the trailing-edge flaps and the Gurney flap are effective at lift augmentation; however, the plain flap has only a moderate associated drag penalty, while that of the Gurney flap is large. The drag increment of the Gurney flap is proportional to its relative area compared to that of the wing and far outweighs the Gurney flap’s associated lift increment. Consequently, this leads to a significant drop in wing efficiency compared to the trailing-edge flap or planar wing. The addition of either type of flap causes a pitching moment reversal. Analytic modeling of both flaps successfully captured the aerodynamic effect of the flaps as a function of their geometric variables.",56,2

This paper assesses the feasibility of replacing current air traffic control sequencing and merging techniques, mainly based on path stretching and air holding, by a control based on RTA over metering fixes on known and fixed arrival routes. Because the remaining distance to the runway threshold is always known by the aircraft crew, this would allow engine-idle CDOs that do not require speed-brake usage and where only elevator control is used to meet the RTA. The assessment has been performed for Barcelona-El Prat Airport (Spain) using historical traffic demand data. The earliest and latest trajectories at a metering fix for each inbound aircraft were computed assuming engine-idle CDOs. Given the attainable RTA window for each aircraft, the aircraft sequencing problem was solved. The results show that assigning RTA allows optimizing the landing sequence when air traffic is low. For scenarios with high-traffic loads and late RTA assignments, path stretching still was found to be necessary. The minimum distance from the runway where inbound aircraft should receive the RTA to fully remove any radar vectoring was also analyzed. It was demonstrated that the assignment of RTA well before starting the descent would favor to enable full CDOs.",56,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034901,"To determine the capability of a morphing hypersonic waverider, this paper develops an optimal morphing control scheme to quantify the impact that the representative morphing error has on aerodynamic performance. The morphing waverider concept could improve thermal loading, vehicle acceleration, local and global load factors, fuel consumption, and total energy dissipation. The key design limitation of conventional waveriders is that the optimal geometry is highly dependent on the Mach number, and deviations from the design point significantly degrade performance. The Naval Research Laboratory has developed a family of morphing waveriders with a constant leading edge and a top surface with a morphing lower stream surface to enable ondesign performance across a wide Mach number range. To evaluate the morphing waverider concept, a Mach 10 waverider is designed to enable shock attachment from Mach 10 to 5. A Q-DEIM-algorithm sensitivity analysis identifies the optimal control points set (actuator locations). This paper shows that the ideal morphing waverider significantly improves performance and a two-control-point or six-control-point system provides 90 and 97% of the ideal control system performance improvements. This work demonstrates a methodology to actuate the waverider lower stream surface to enable optimum aerodynamic performance across a range of Mach numbers.",56,2

However, not all outer mold lines are obtainable from a given reference configuration as the extent to which the outer mold line can deform is restricted by both the reference airfoil shape and wing internal structure. In this Paper, the class/shape transformation parameterization method is modified for the first time to consider the kinematics of a morphing airfoil with rigid internal structure, providing structurally consistent class/shape transformation equations. Considering as an example the use of skin-based actuators and certain assumptions regarding the internal structure, accurate kinematically feasible deformed configurations are rapidly calculated without the need for structural analysis or consideration of actuation technology, enabling rapid iterative preliminary design optimization. The kinematic relations are accurate for moderate deformations (strains less than or equal to 4%) while still providing good estimates for larger deformations when comparing to finite-element analysis results.",56,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034964,"Air data systems require costly calibration of their static pressure sensors to characterize errors caused by the act of flying. Altitude-based methods for measuring these so-called static position errors, such as the tower flyby, produce accurate results but require an elaborate flyby site, multiple experiments to capture the relationship between error and airspeed, and are limited to subsonic airspeeds due to inherent hazards to land-based and aircraft structures from low-altitude supersonic flight. Airspeed-based methods using the Global Positioning System (GPS) are generally easier to execute, but they tend to yield less precise results and still require multiple experiments. Additionally, they require temperature probe calibration from external sources. This paper proposes a self-contained online method for complete air data calibration. The proposed method uses a Kalman smoother to fuse GPS altitude and airspeed measurements, aircraft attitude, and air data to produce the full static position error curve as a function of Mach number in a single experiment, with no need for external temperature calibration and with no supersonic limitations. The proposed method is validated using T-38C flight data, and it is shown to reduce cost by 88% while modeling a 42% larger domain when compared to current methods.",56,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034809,"Parametric noise assessment in the context of low-noise aircraft design and flight procedure optimization has been around for more than 15 years. Yet reliable and comprehensive uncertainty analysis of the overall aircraft noise-prediction process was not available for parametric tools in the past. This paper presents a methodology to assess the overall uncertainty of DLR, German Aerospace Center’s aircraft system noise simulation with the software Parametric Aircraft Noise Analysis Module (i.e., definition of a general approach to specify uncertainties of the predicted ground noise immission). This allows discussion of the temporal and spatial distribution of the uncertainties. The noise-prediction uncertainties vary between locations along the flight path. The impact on exposure–response relationships due to the variation in uncertainty is discussed (i.e., the influence of varying noise source dominance along simulated flights). Results of this uncertainty assessment along typical flight procedures and their impact on the A-weighted maximum sound pressure level are presented.",56,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035051,"The potential for reductions in emissions, energy costs, and maintenance costs has led to interest in battery-electric propulsion for small aircraft. However, the low specific energy of current batteries considerably limits aircraft range, payload, and speed performance. Additionally, recharge power limitations impede the ability to recharge quickly between flights, restricting the feasibility of electric aircraft for scheduled operations. This paper considers the problem of choosing the cruise airspeeds of different flights within a schedule to maximize the energy feasibility of the schedule, subject to the constraints of a fixed timeline of departures. Two types of schedules are considered: one in which every route is the same and repeating, and one in which every route may be unique. This optimization problem results in airspeeds that balance energy expended during cruise and energy replenished during recharge. A greedy algorithm is presented to determine these optimal airspeeds for schedules with unique routes.",56,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034969,"The aerodynamic shock buffet phenomenon limits the flight envelope of typical transonic aircraft at high Mach number or incidence. For future aircraft design, its correct prediction by numerical methods and control strategies are of great interest. In the present paper, simplified industrial applicable design guidelines for shock control bumps are summarized and assessed based on numerical (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations of a wing-body configuration. The design guidelines cover both design objectives, wave drag reduction at dash flight, and buffet delay/alleviation. Three different shock control bumps have been designed: a two-dimensional bump for wave drag reduction at dash flight, a two-dimensional bump for delay of buffet onset, and a three-dimensional bump array with the intention of combining both design objectives. The two-dimensional bumps mark the maximum potential for each design objective with a drag reduction of 9 drag counts at dash flight and a delay of buffet onset by 4 lift counts. Even though the three-dimensional bump array combines both design objectives, it does not perform as well as expected due to massive crest-flow separation and a (so far) minor role of the vortical wake of three-dimensional bumps in delaying buffet onset.",56,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035093,"This Paper reports a computational investigation on the effects of side gust on the performance of a double-cone external compression supersonic inlet at Mach 1.8. The supersonic inlet geometry comprises three zones: a supersonic zone, a transit zone, and a subsonic zone. The supersonic zone is designed numerically using the Taylor–Maccoll method, while the transit and subsonic zones are designed using a methodology from literature. A three-dimensional structured mesh is generated by using the ICEM computational fluid dynamics software. Detailed three-dimensional simulations are performed using the ANSYS Fluent 18.2 code. The grid independency tests are performed by using local grid refinements and varying the number of grid points from 2.5 to 9.5 million. Further, the Fluent code is validated by comparing predictions with those using the SUPIN and Wind-US codes. The effects of side gust on the flowfield and oblique and normal shocks are analyzed by examining the Mach number and pressure distributions in the three zones. The inlet performance is characterized in terms of total pressure loss, flow distortion, and mass flow ratio parameters for a side gust of and gust angles of 30, 60, and 90 deg. Results indicate that the inlet performance is significantly affected by the side gust, especially at small gust angles.",56,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034968,"Additional results about the wing-body of the NASA Common Research Model at flight conditions derived from those of the AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop are introduced in this Paper. An initial assessment compared the widely used shear stress transport model with the full Reynolds stress model as two possible closures for the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes problem. The study, based on the 6th AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop, confirmed the limitations of linear eddy-viscosity turbulence models in highly anisotropic turbulent flows. A side-of-body separation larger than previous experiments was predicted by the shear stress transport model. By comparison, the study revealed that the Reynolds stress model is capable of simulating higher-incidence transonic flight as the trends observed in the results were in overall good agreement with the experiment. The aim herein was to investigate the high-incidence transonic aerodynamics about the Common Research Model. Using Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes closed with the Reynolds stress model, the aeroelastically deformed Common Research Model was then simulated at incidences outside of the Drag Prediction Workshop remit. The evolution of shock-induced boundary-layer separation was observed. A separation bubble was first predicted at an incidence of 3.5 deg, then developed in the chordwise and spanwise directions, triggering the stall of the aircraft at an incidence of 5.75 deg. Using shear lines helps one understand the three-dimensionality of this phenomenon as large areas of crossflow are present, starting in the wing-kink region and extending toward the wing tip.",56,2

There is evidence that airframe mass distribution along the longitudinal axis can affect the gust load alleviation factor. In this paper, the inclusion of the pitching degree of freedom in the model is explored, accounting for the aircraft mass distribution along the longitudinal axis. Two different two-degree-of-freedom models are presented and numerical solutions are offered. A typical heavy transport aircraft is used for illustration. It is shown that the inclusion of the second degree of freedom results in as much as 10% reduction in the magnitude of the gust load alleviation factor.",56,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034736,"This paper details the performance and flowfield measurements on a mesoscale cycloidal rotor (rotor radius of 1 in.), which operates at ultralow Reynolds numbers and uses a design different from previous cycloidal rotor studies. The mesoscale rotor uses a cantilevered blade with a flat-plate airfoil and low-aspect-ratio elliptical blade planform. A three-component balance was developed to measure the vertical and sideward thrust, torque, and rotation frequency as the number of blades, pitch amplitude, and blade aspect ratio were varied. The studies showed that the highest efficiency was achieved with higher number of blades (4–6), high pitch amplitude (40–45 deg), and moderate aspect ratios. Phase-locked flowfield measurements were conducted using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique in two different orientations: chordwise and spanwise. PIV measurements show that the flowfield on the present mesoscale cycloidal rotor is highly three-dimensional and unsteady, characterized by the growth and shedding of leading-edge vortices and a trailing-edge vortex sheet similar to that seen on flapping wings; strong root and tip vortices that interact with each other to create an undulating wake; skewed inflow; and the strong interaction of the slip stream from the upper blade on the lower blade.",56,2

The study included tests of an airfoil model, with a heated-air IPS, installed in the NRC’s Altitude Icing Wind Tunnel (AIWT) at altitude and ground level conditions. Two scaling strategies were employed based on Reynolds number and Weber number, the latter combined with matching the ratio of water loading and evaporative rates.

The goals of the workshop continued in the tradition of the first and second high-lift workshops: to assess the numerical prediction capability of current-generation computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology for swept, medium/high-aspect-ratio wings in landing/takeoff (high-lift) configurations. This workshop analyzed the flow over two different configurations, a “clean” high-lift version of the NASA Common Research Model, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Standard Model. The former was a CFD-only study because experimental data were not available before the workshop. The latter was a nacelle/pylon installation study that included comparison with experimental wind-tunnel data. The workshop also included a two-dimensional turbulence model verification exercise. Thirty-five participants submitted a total of 79 data sets of CFD results. A variety of grid systems (both structured and unstructured) as well as different flow simulation methodologies (including Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and lattice Boltzmann) were used.

The flight data reveal that complex aerodynamic interactions could appear and significantly influence the forces and moments acting on the quadrotor, which indicate the inaccuracy of state-of-art models established based on helicopter aerodynamic theory. To cope with this problem, gray-box models considering these effects are identified from flight data using a stepwise system identification approach, which combines both prior knowledge of rotorcraft aerodynamic properties as well as data observations.

To solve this issue, a special pressure measurement system is designed. Several microtransient differential pressure sensors are placed on a plexiglass board that is arranged vertically to the plasma actuator to detect the inconspicuous changes of pressure gradient in the induced flow. The board is then moved in the horizontal direction, driven by the lead screw transmission. To verify the reliability of the experimental pressure field, the plasma computational model is applied to simulate the pressure distribution of plasma flow, and it is compared with the experimental results. To study how the pressure term contributes to the body force calculation of plasma flow, the measured pressure field from the experiment is regarded as the source term and substituted into Navier–Stokes equations to calculate the body force distribution. The body force neglecting the pressure term is compared with the body force that includes the pressure term.

Effects of the lag damper model are examined with the coupled Helios/Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis System (RCAS) by calculating lag damper loads using a nonlinear lag damper model or by applying measured lag damper loads as prescribed external loads. RCAS alone analysis is also performed by prescribing measured airloads from the tests to help identify whether sources of inaccuracies in the structural loads prediction originate from deficiencies in aerodynamics or structural dynamics. Both lag damper loads and airloads are important for the accurate prediction of chord bending moments. The effects of drivetrain dynamics on the chord bending moment for the flight test and the effects of hub impedance using test stand NASTRAN model on the chord bending moment for the wind-tunnel test are also investigated. In general, the effects of drivetrain dynamics are small. There is a slight improvement for the 4/rev and 5/rev harmonic magnitude correlation.

Therefore, the deterministic two-phase wake vortex model D2P, the aircraft vortex spacing system prediction algorithm (APA) 3.2, APA 3.4, APA 3.8, and terminal area simulation system driven algorithms for wake prediction (TDP 2.1) wake-vortex models are exchanged within the framework of a NASA/DLR cooperation. These models are fused by the Bayesian model averaging approach, which is extended by temporally increasing uncertainties. In addition, combined confidence areas for the vertical and lateral vortex positions are derived from bivariate probability density distributions that are delivered by the ensemble and allow the computation of well-defined probability levels. For ensemble training and evaluation data collected at wake-vortex campaigns accomplished by NASA (at Memphis, Dallas, and Denver airports) and DLR (at Frankfurt, Munich, and Oberpfaffenhofen airports) are employed.

SpaRibs are parameterized by third-order B-splines with constraints on the starting, ending, and various control points. A broad range of SpaRibs topologies can be created using a limited number of parameters. For local size optimization, panels are generated from the wing finite element model by an algorithm that is independent of the nodal coordinates and the order in which the elements are distributed, and which can be used for a broad range of aircraft wings. The local panel thicknesses are optimized to satisfy buckling and stress constraints of the wing using an algorithm that increases the thickness of the panels that are found to be vulnerable to buckling or wherein the stress is higher than the maximum permissible stress. This algorithm has been integrated with the particle swarm algorithm to optimize the SpaRibs topology for multiple objectives (weight and flutter velocity).

When properly designed, these models reproduce the full-scale flowfield and ice accretions on the leading edge, with reduced tunnel blockage. Although a method exists for designing hybrid airfoils, no systematic method is available in the literature for designing hybrid swept wings. This paper presents a method for designing three-dimensional swept hybrid wings using hybrid airfoils for the purpose of generating full-scale ice accretions, such as those on large commercial aircraft, in icing wind tunnels. An application example using the method is shown for the design of three hybrid wings representing different wing stations of a modern commercial aircraft. Investigations of the effects of tunnel walls, model sweep angle, model aspect ratio, model thickness, and wind-tunnel blockage are also presented. Attachment-line location was used as a first-order parameter for matching full-scale ice shapes, following the findings of previous investigations on hybrid airfoils. Methods for controlling the spanwise variation of attachment line due to flow three-dimensionality were assessed with the use of angle of attack, gap between the model and tunnel wall, aerodynamic twist, and segmented flaps.

The heading stabilization controller developed during the vertical wind-tunnel experiments is applicable during outdoor flight testing with only minor modifications, and the open-loop heading model and GR model both produce results that are consistent with data collected during outdoor flight testing. The vertical wind-tunnel testing methodology itself is discussed in terms of the cost and time savings as compared to traditional outdoor flight testing. Additionally, the extensibility of the vertical wind-tunnel testing methodology to other parachute systems is discussed. The vertical wind-tunnel approach to testing a system like the steerable cruciform provides the capability to investigate the viability of an untested parachute system rapidly while still providing realistic performance, thereby creating a repeatable and inexpensive alternative to outdoor flight testing.",56,2

The rotor is modeled using a single blade with a free flap hinge at the hub, the motion of which is suppressed at integer multiples of the blade passage frequency by introducing harmonics of the joint rotation angle as additional trim variables, efficiently simulating gimbal kinematics. Rotor frequencies are examined for a three-bladed gimbaled rotor model and are found to combine the modes of both free flap hinge and fixed flap hinge (cantilevered) one-bladed models, similar to a teetering rotor, justifying the gimbal modeling methodology. Gimbal flapping is examined for a proprotor in edgewise flight: successful suppression of steady and 3/rev flapping indicates the gimbal model accurately represents the rotor kinematics. Air loads and blade loads are examined with and without with the gimbal model, revealing an increase in 3/rev sectional normal aerodynamic force on the blade but a decrease in the 3/rev flap and lag bending moment when the gimbal is added. Three-dimensional axial stress distribution at the blade root is examined, revealing only minor differences with and without the gimbal model, primarily in the flex beam.",56,2

The DERM is a subgrid-scale model for CFD that accounts for the momentum and heat transfer aspects of large-scale roughness that displays an improvement of the heat transfer predictions beyond those of traditional sand-grain-roughness (SGR) models. The CFD-DERM approach is used to replace the built-in heat transfer prediction module of LEWICE for a multistep ice-shape prediction. Comparisons of ice-shape predictions and aerodynamics are made between the experiment, SGR-LEWICE, and DERM-LEWICE to evaluate the benefit of an improved heat transfer prediction methodology. The results indicate that the DERM model provides an improved prediction of heat transfer relevant to ice roughness. Additionally, ice-shape predictions in the glaze-icing regime are shown to be sensitive to the convective heat transfer prediction method. However, the improved heat transfer prediction does not necessarily correlate to an improved ice-shape prediction.",56,2
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035108,"A safe revision of current aircraft separation minima requires detailed knowledge of the vortex decay and its effect on encountering aircraft. The wake vortex system generated by an aircraft rolls up to a pair of counter-rotating vortices. They deform with growing vortex age due to the long-wave Crow instability, and they later break up into vortex rings. However, most encounter flight simulations to date simply consider the vortex decay by a reduction in circulation strength but not by vortex deformation. This paper investigates the impact of wake vortex deformation on the hazard and risk of aircraft encounters by means of mass encounter flight simulations. Different methods to model aging vortices are compared in terms of their ability to adequately reproduce the vortex-induced aircraft response. The results show that the vortex deformation affects the response of encountering aircraft and may cause an increased hazard in terms of bank angle upsets. It should therefore be incorporated in vortex simulation models. The encounter risk, which describes the frequency of hazardous encounters, decreases with the vortex age. The decrease is significant for large deformations and vortex rings; however, it is lower than expected for small deformations. This result provides the potential to reduce current separation minima.",56,2

The effort is performed within the context of time-accurate large-eddy simulations of Simple Frigate Shape 2, which is immersed into a turbulence-resolving atmospheric inflow that emulates the dynamics of a realistic atmospheric boundary layer. Several baseline cases are used to represent a traditional approach of modeling the incoming wind as a constant, uniform inflow. When comparing the atmospheric boundary layer-resolving to the baseline simulations, it is observed that the velocities in a ship airwake are considerably different when formed from an atmospheric boundary layer. The unsteady computational fluid dynamics solution is then saved as a database and used as external disturbances for flight dynamics analysis. Such an approach is common in piloted flight simulation. The pilot workload is evaluated using a helicopter approach scenario and multiple hover locations. Such cases are evaluated, and it is found that the large scales present in the atmospheric boundary layer notably disturb the helicopter. The disturbances result in increased controls input and aircraft movement. Frequency-domain analysis of the increased stick movement suggest that the atmospheric boundary layer impacts the 0.1–2 Hz stick controls, which comprise the frequency range known to affect pilot workload.",56,2
