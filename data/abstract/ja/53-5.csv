0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032744,"Variable-speed rotor studies represent a promising research field for rotorcraft performance improvement and fuel-consumption reduction. The problems related to employing a main rotor variable speed are numerous and require an interdisciplinary approach. There are two main variable-speed concepts, depending on the type of transmission employed: fixed-ratio transmission and continuously variable transmission rotors. The impact of the two types of transmissions upon overall helicopter performance is estimated when both are operating at their optimal speeds. This is done by using an optimization strategy able to find the optimal rotational speeds of the main rotor and turboshaft engine for each flight condition. The process makes use of two different simulation tools: a turboshaft engine performance code and a helicopter trim simulation code for steady-state level flight. The first is a gas turbine performance simulator (called TSHAFT), developed and validated at the University of Padova. The second is a simple tool used to evaluate the single blade forces and integrate them over the 360 deg revolution of the main rotor, and thus to predict an average value of the power load required by the engine. The results show that the fixed-ratio transmission does not present significant performance differences compared to the continuously variable transmission for a wide range of advancing speeds. However, close to the two conditions of maximum interest (that is, hover and cruise forward flight), the discrepancies between the two transmission types become relevant: in fact, engine performance is found to be penalized by fixed-ratio transmission, proving that significant fuel reductions can be obtained only by employing the continuously variable transmission concept. In conclusion, fixed-ratio transmission is a good way to reduce fuel consumption at intermediate advancing speeds; continuously variable transmission advantages become relevant only near hover and high-speed cruise conditions.",53,5

The objective is to minimize the makespan for all the aircraft to land at or depart from the airport. This paper presents a novel approach to deal with aircraft separation constraints. The separation time is considered as the combination of the turbulence generated by the preceding aircraft and the ability of the succeeding aircraft to resist turbulence. With this novel concept, the separation constraints are more flexible with aircraft types and are linear with the decision variables. When the sequencing matrix is used as the decision variable, the required number of separation constraints grows linearly with the number of aircraft instead of the quadratic growth with existing formulations. The current formulation also considers the problem of minimizing the deviation from scheduled arriving and departing times. The result provides the speed advisories for each aircraft to air traffic controllers. With the current optimization process, the final result can meet both optimal sequence and minimal time variation requirements. Finally, several simulation results are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.",53,5

This study investigates the potential reduction in altitude trajectory prediction errors that could be achieved for climbing flights if just one additional parameter is made available: top-of-climb time. The top-of-climb matching method developed and evaluated in this paper is straightforward: A set of candidate trajectory predictions is generated using different aircraft weight parameters, and the one that most closely matches top of climb in terms of time is selected. This algorithm was tested using more than 1000 climbing flights in Fort Worth Center. Compared with the baseline trajectory predictions of a real-time research prototype (Center/Terminal Radar Approach Control Automation System), the top-of-climb matching method reduced the altitude root mean square error for a 5 min prediction time by 38%. It also decreased the percentage of flights with absolute altitude error greater than the vertical separation standard of 1000 ft for the same look-ahead time from 55 to 30%.",53,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033624,"A method is presented for using large-eddy simulation to generate urban wake fields for use in studying the effects on the autonomous flight performance of a small quadrotor. The flowfield is solved around a single square building using OpenFOAM and stored in a database accessed by a MATLAB/Simulink flight simulator. Four flight missions are evaluated to compare the difference in performance between wake fields generated by Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and large-eddy simulation solutions. The results of the holding position in a constant freestream wind show both methods produce similar results and can hold position in all three directions within approximately body lengths. When the quadrotor is in or on the boundary of the building wake, the maximum deviation volumes, as calculated when using a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes or large-eddy simulation air wake, can differ by two orders of magnitude. Additionally, the large-eddy simulation air wakes can cause skewed deviations by as much as five to one in a given direction for both holding position and moving along a desired flight path. Since the turbulent large-eddy simulation wake field more accurately reflects the flow physics present within the wake of real-world structures, it is recommended that large-eddy-simulation-generated wake fields be used when designing and testing autonomous control algorithms for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles on the order of 0.5 m in size and 2 kg in mass.",53,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033634,"This study investigates maximizing net power input from a solar-photovoltaic array and/or a thermal updraft while performing constant bank angle, circular flight-path turns (that is, an orbit). The process inputs are the aircraft sink polar (or, equivalently, the power required curve), the date, the time, the location, and the flight altitude. A solar insolation model is combined with a best-turn performance calculation to determine the bank angle that maximizes power input from a solar-photovoltaic array at varying sun elevation angles. In general, for low sun elevation angles, the maximum net power gain from solar input and drag output is found at higher bank angles and shows 15% (absolute) gain over the limiting case of wings-level orbits in the same conditions. For high sun elevation angles, the maximum net power is found at low bank angles. The break point between high and low sun elevation angles varies with aircraft parameters and is approximately 25 deg for the example aircraft in this paper. The relative power losses of off-optimum orbits at a given bank angle are quantified. Finally, a thermal-updraft model is included in the net power calculations to determine an optimal bank angle that maximizes the average power input from a combination of solar photovoltaics and thermal updrafts. This paper shows that soaring and solar photovoltaics can be mutually beneficial, and it provides a method to calculate losses at off-optimum conditions.",53,5

The present work was aimed at providing an improved understanding of Reynolds number effects in both forward and reverse flow. Time-averaged sectional airloads and surface oil flow visualizations were obtained experimentally for four airfoil cross sections at Reynolds numbers between and . Two airfoils with a sharp geometric trailing edge (a NACA 0012 and a NACA 0024) and two airfoils with a blunt geometric trailing edge (a 24% thick elliptical airfoil and a 26% thick cambered ellipse airfoil) were tested. This work shows that the airloads for a NACA 0012 in reverse flow are insensitive to Reynolds number due to early flow separation, because it acts as a “thin” airfoil due to the sharp aerodynamic leading edge. The airloads of thicker airfoils were found to be more sensitive to Reynolds number. In reverse flow, the NACA 0024 exhibits a decrease in the magnitude of the airloads with increasing Reynolds number for . The lift curve of an elliptical airfoil becomes more linear with increasing Reynolds number. The character of the lift curve for the cambered ellipse airfoil changes drastically for in both forward and reverse flow. These results provide insight for the design of high-speed helicopter rotor blades by examining the sensitivity of airloads to the range of Reynolds numbers encountered in the reverse flow region.",53,5

The techniques were developed and demonstrated during piloted flight testing of an Aermacchi MB-326M Impala jet aircraft. Advanced piloting techniques and nonlinear modeling techniques based on fuzzy logic and multivariate orthogonal function methods were implemented with efficient onboard calculations and flight operations to achieve real-time maneuver monitoring, near-real-time global nonlinear aerodynamic modeling, and prediction validation testing in flight. Results demonstrated that global nonlinear aerodynamic models for a large portion of the flight envelope were identified rapidly and accurately using piloted flight test maneuvers during a single flight, with the final identified and validated models available before the aircraft landed.",53,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033652,"The damage tolerance analysis, which uses the force structural management plan, is usually employed in airplane fatigue life prediction. This plan, based on a mission “mix” defined at the airplane structure design phase, induces the squadrons to follow this mix and interferes in the fleet’s usage efficiency. Deviations in the mission mix have impacts on inspection intervals and maintenance costs. In this paper, a fatigue life monitoring system is proposed. It is able to incorporate each mission, individually, in a specific aircraft’s fatigue life analysis, adjusting the maintenance plan into a more realistic usage profile, based on the individual aircraft tracking methodology. This monitoring system is implemented in a computer software and it is applied to F-5E fighter aircraft of the Brazilian Air Force. In addition, experimental fatigue tests that simulate critical locations of this aircraft are compared with the proposed monitoring system, which shows ability to predict, in conservative and approximate ways, the crack length after each flight, disregarding the predefined mission mix. This makes the flexibilization of the operations possible without jeopardizing the inspection and maintenance planning.",53,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033490,"In this paper, optimum wing bending and torsion deformations are explored for a mission adaptive, highly flexible morphing aircraft. The complete highly flexible aircraft is modeled using a strain-based geometrically nonlinear beam formulation, coupled with unsteady aerodynamics and six-degree-of-freedom rigid-body motions. Since there are no conventional discrete control surfaces for trimming the flexible aircraft, the design space for searching the optimum wing geometries is enlarged. To achieve high-performance flight, the wing geometry is best tailored according to the specific flight mission needs. In this study, the steady level flight and the coordinated turn flight are considered, and the optimum wing deformations with the minimum drag at these flight conditions are searched by using a modal-based optimization procedure, subject to the trim and other constraints. The numerical study verifies the feasibility of the modal-based optimization approach, and it shows the resulting optimum wing configuration and its sensitivity under different flight profiles.",53,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032757,"A flight parameter sensor simulation model was developed to assess the conservatism of the landing gear component loads calculated using a typical hard-landing analysis process. Conservatism exists due to factors of safety that are incorporated into any hard-landing analysis process to account for uncertainty in the measurement of certain flight parameters. The flight parameter sensor simulation model consists of 1) an aircraft and landing gear dynamic model to determine the “actual” landing gear loads during a hard landing; 2) an aircraft sensor and data acquisition model to represent the aircraft sensors and flight data recorder systems to investigate the effect of signal processing on the flight parameters; and 3) an automated hard-landing analysis process, representative of that used by airframe and equipment manufacturers, to determine the “simulated” landing gear loads. Using a technique of Bayesian sensitivity analysis, a number of flight parameters are varied in the flight parameter sensor simulation model to gain an understanding of the sensitivity of the difference between actual and simulated loads to the individual flight parameters in symmetric and asymmetric two-point landings. This study shows that the error can be reduced by learning the true value of the following flight parameters: longitudinal tire–runway friction coefficient, aircraft vertical acceleration (related to vertical descent velocity), lateral acceleration (related to lateral velocity), Euler roll angle, mass, center of gravity position, and main landing gear tire type. It was also shown that, due to the modeling techniques used, shock absorber servicing state and tire pressure do not contribute significantly to the error.",53,5

The research in this paper was developed on the observations made in the experiments and conducted numerical simulations to further investigate the parametric design space. Two linear-time-invariant models were developed: rigid-body planing craft (conventional float planes or flying boats), and flexibly supported planing craft. The latter could simulate the new method found in the experiments for suppressing porpoising. In this study, the stability of the oscillatory motions was analyzed to see the effect of design variables on the inception of porpoising. The parametric study of flexibly supported float planes in the context of porpoising was a new contribution in the conceptual design of seaplanes.",53,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033819,"Experimental data are presented for the parasite drag of various helicopter fuselage components, such as skids, external fuel tanks, and tailplane. The experiments were conducted at the Kazan National Research Technical University (Kazan Aviation Institute) T-1K wind tunnel, investigating four versions of a fuselage similar to the Ansat helicopter. It was found that, for the range of pitch angles , the skids added 80% to the drag of the bare fuselage, whereas the tailplane increased the drag by 20%. At the same conditions, external fuel tanks were found to add 48% to the clean fuselage drag. A simple rotor hub with a tail support added 74% to the bare fuselage in the range of pitch angles . Streamlining the rear fuselage was found to reduce the drag by 16% over the range of pitch angles . Apart from the parasite drag, ideas for drag reduction are also discussed.",53,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033591,"This study investigates the potential of unconventional aircraft transports through numerical optimization. Three distinct configurations are investigated: a box wing, a C-tip blended wing–body, and a braced wing. Each transport is sized for the same regional mission and is subjected to the same optimization strategy based on the Euler equations. The figure of merit is inviscid pressure drag at transonic speed; the nonlinear constraints are lift, pitching moment, and internal volume. The design variables include the section shape and twist distribution of the main lifting surfaces. It is found that the box-wing, C-tip blended-wing–body, and braced-wing configurations investigated here are, respectively, 34.1, 36.2, and 40.3% more efficient than a similarly optimized conventional tube-and-wing configuration. Each optimization revealed, in one way or another, the importance of accounting for flow nonlinearity during the early stages of unconventional aircraft design. For the blended wing–body, the C tip does not appear to provide a drag benefit over a purely vertical winglet, presumably as a result of the compressibility effects prevalent in the C opening. For the braced wing, compressibility effects also lead to a curious result, where the supporting strut finds itself carrying negative lift at the optimum.",53,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033610,"This paper presents a study that numerically investigated which cruise speed the next generation of short-haul aircraft with 150 seats should fly at, and whether a conventional two- or three-shaft turbofan, a geared turbofan, a turboprop, or an open rotor should be employed to make the aircraft’s direct operating cost robust to uncertain fuel and carbon prices in the year 2030, taking the aircraft productivity, the passenger value of time, and the modal shift into account. To answer this question, an optimization loop was set up in MATLAB consisting of nine modules covering gas turbine and airframe design and performance, flight and aircraft-fleet simulation, operating cost, and optimization. If the passenger value of time is included, the most robust aircraft design is powered by geared turbofan engines and cruises at Mach 0.80. If the value of time is ignored, however, then a turboprop aircraft flying at Mach 0.70 is the optimum solution. This demonstrates that the most fuel-efficient option, the open rotor, is not automatically the most cost-efficient solution because of the relatively high engine and airframe costs.",53,5

This study builds on previous work investigating the effect of exploiting folding wing tips in-flight as a device to reduce dynamic gust loads, but now with the introduction of a passive nonlinear hinge spring to allow wing-tip deflections only for larger load cases. A representative civil jet aircraft aeroelastic model is used in a multibody simulation code to explore the effect of introducing such a hinged wing-tip device on the loads behavior.

15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033683,"One of the most important tasks of aircraft vulnerability assessment is to rank vulnerable components so that proper actions can be applied to the weaker components to improve survivability. Currently, when comparing the contributions of components to the overall aircraft vulnerability in a military context, existing methods focused on the aircraft kill state without considering the intermediate states that are related to performance degradations. This work aims to investigate how performance-related importance measures in the field of reliability can be modified to rank the vulnerable components. Component vulnerability importance measures considering performance degradations are proposed. Two applications, one with eight critical components and one consisting of 84 noncritical components and 28 critical components dealing with aircraft being hit by metallic fragments detonated from a missile, are provided. The analysis shows that the proposed method is useful for engineers to determine which components are more likely to cause aircraft performance degradations in the combat environment from the standpoint of vulnerability.",53,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033247,"It is shown that the time-dependent aerodynamic forces acting on a flapping airfoil in forward flight are functions of both axial and normal reduced frequencies. The axial reduced frequency is based on the chord length, and the normal reduced frequency is based on the plunging amplitude. Furthermore, the time-dependent aerodynamic forces are related to two Fourier coefficients, which are evaluated here from computational results. Correlation equations for these Fourier coefficients are obtained from a large number of grid- and time-step-resolved inviscid computational-fluid-dynamics solutions, conducted over a range of both axial and normal reduced frequencies. The correlation results can be used to predict the thrust, required power, and propulsive efficiency for airfoils in forward flight with sinusoidal pitching and plunging motion. Within the range of parameters typically encountered in the efficient forward flight of birds, results obtained from the correlation equations match the computational-fluid-dynamics results more closely than do those obtained from the classical Theodorsen model.",53,5

The configuration consists of a baseline laminar flow geometry, with smoothly deflected leading- and trailing-edge flaps, corresponding to a wind-tunnel model. Both flaps are deployed at a 45 deg angle with respect to the undeflected state, and blowing from internal plenums is employed to mitigate transition, increase attached flow, and enhance lift. Solutions were obtained to the Navier–Stokes equations, at the experimental chord-based Reynolds number of and Mach number of 0.14. The numerical method is based upon a high-fidelity scheme and an implicit time-marching approach. Results were generated for two different angles of attack, in freestream conditions and within the confines of wind-tunnel walls. Comparisons are made with available experimental data in terms of surface pressure distributions, and the effect of blowing is quantified by comparison to baseline cases without control. Details of the computations are described, and physical features of the computed flowfields are characterized. Disparities between measurements and computations were attributable to many details of the experimental arrangement that were unknown or that could not be duplicated in the numerical calculations. The large-scale simulations provided much information of a complex flow situation, by capturing detailed physics of the configuration, that could not be obtained through alternative methods.",53,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033715,"Residual stress induced by riveting process is critical to the fatigue life of riveted structures. A residual stress model is proposed to predict the residual stress distribution after riveting process. In the residual stress model, the radial pressure at the hole boundary is obtained, and the strain hardening effect of the rivet material is taken into consideration. The other characteristic of the model is that the solution of radial and circumferential residual stresses is extended to include an unfree springback process by using a springback coefficient. The residual stresses on the faying surface with various parameters, such as the height of the rivet drive head, the hole diameter, and the material property, are predicted with the residual stress model. The residual stresses calculated by the model are employed in the fatigue life prediction using the multi-axial fatigue criterion. The predicted results of the fatigue life show a good agreement with the experimental data. The investigation in this paper can help the residual stress prediction of riveted joints and improve the awareness of the effect of the residual stress on the fatigue behavior of riveted structures.",53,5

The tests were conducted at a freestream Mach number of 0.71. Both leading-edge and trailing-edge modifications were included in the studies. Results from surface pressure measurements showed that leading-edge control techniques were more effective at suppressing cavity tone amplitudes than trailing-edge modifications. A square-tooth spoiler showed the greatest reduction in tonal amplitude (8.8 dB); however, a sawtooth spoiler showed the greatest reduction in overall sound pressure level (8.13 dB). Velocity measurements inside the cavity were made using particle image velocimetry for the clean cavity and the cavity with sawtooth spoilers. The results showed a reduction in momentum exchange between the freestream flow and the cavity when spoilers were used. This is proposed to be the main reason for the reduced tonal amplitudes.",53,5

A classical Monte Carlo simulation was carried out at greatly reduced computational cost through dual-level Kriging surrogate models, and it determines the variance of the simulation for uncertainty quantification. The accuracy and numerical stability of the Kriging model were improved by a mathematical indicator of the function trend. The numerical instabilities of the Kriging model in finding distribution parameters were also reduced by the approaches of penalization and cross-validation in a maximum likelihood evaluation. Finally, the robust design optimization framework was applied to a low-noise DLR, German Aerospace Center contrarotating open rotor at a nominal takeoff condition. The objective function was to minimize an overall sound power level at the baseline thrust level. An efficient computational-fluid-dynamics approach of the harmonic balance method solved unsteady open-rotor flows, and aeroacoustic characteristics were computed by Ffowcs-Williams–Hawkings equations.

By replacing the mechanism’s rotational joints with equivalent high-stiffness elastic joints, numerical-continuation methods can be applied directly to dynamic models of landing-gear mechanisms. The effects of using elastic joints are considered through two applications: an overcenter mechanism and a nose-landing-gear mechanism. In both cases, selecting a sufficient stiffness for the elastic joint is shown to provide accurate continuation results. The advantages of this new modeling approach are then demonstrated by considering the unlocking of a nose landing gear with a single uplock/downlock mechanism, when subjected to different orientations and magnitudes of gravitational loading. The unlocking process is shown to be qualitatively insensitive to changes in both load angle and load magnitude, ratifying the robustness of a previously proposed control methodology for unlocking a nose landing gear with a single uplock/downlock mechanism.",53,5

The numerical results show good potentialities in performance and consistent geometrical properties along the family. The 21% thick geometry has been wind-tunnel tested to validate the predictions. The tests have been carried out in free and fixed transitions at different Reynolds numbers. Special tests also include vortex generators.

The economic and environmental sustainability of commercial aviation requires not only the design of efficient new aircraft but also consideration of the operations of these aircraft. This can be achieved by coupling the design optimization of multiple aircraft families with the simultaneous allocation of these aircraft in multiple markets. Including operational allocation of aircraft in the design stage can reduce operational inefficiencies, whereas the design of aircraft families aims at reducing costs through the use of common components and providing increased flexibility for different markets. To investigate the tradeoffs involved in designing efficient, environmentally sustainable aircraft, a coupled design optimization of two aircraft families involving uncertainties in passenger demand over multiple years of operations was conducted. The results obtained show that the coupled design of aircraft families with the allocation of these aircraft to two distinct markets can significantly reduce fuel burn, as well as operating and acquisition costs, when compared to existing aircraft. The optimized aircraft also provide higher operational flexibility, with respect to variations in passenger demand, and improved performance when compared against aircraft optimized individually, taking into consideration routes being flown but decoupled from fleet allocation.",53,5
