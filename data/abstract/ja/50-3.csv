For this study, nonclassical parameters such as warping restraint, transverse shear flexibility, and bending–twist structural coupling are incorporated. Further, design parameters of wings such as taper and aspect ratios, sweep angle, initial angle of attack, aileron deflection, and ratios of spanwise and chordwise lengths of the aileron to the wing are newly investigated. The results of this study could play an important role in more efficient designs of composite thin-walled swept wings.",50,3

The use of computational fluid dynamics has potential to supplement costly wind-tunnel testing. The paper considers the problem of the fast computation of forced periodic motions using the Euler equations. Three methods are evaluated. The first is computation in the time domain, which provides the benchmark solution in the sense that the time-accurate solution is obtained. Two acceleration techniques in the frequency domain are compared. The first uses a harmonic solution of the linearized problem, referred to as the linear frequency-domain approach. The second uses the harmonic balance method, which approximates the nonlinear problem using a number of Fourier modes. These approaches are compared for the ability to predict dynamic derivatives and for computational cost. The NACA 0012 aerofoil and the DLR-F12 passenger jet wind-tunnel model are the test cases. Compared to time-domain simulations, an order of magnitude reduction in computational costs is achieved and satisfactory predictions are obtained for cases with a narrow frequency spectrum and moderate amplitudes using the frequency-domain methods.",50,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031693,"A reliability-based multidisciplinary optimization framework is constructed by coupling high-fidelity commercial solvers for aeroelastic analysis and an in-house code developed for reliability analysis. The finite volume-based flow solver Fluent is used to solve inviscid three-dimensional Euler equations, whereas three-dimensional solid models are updated using Catia parametrically. A mesh-based parallel code coupling interface (MPCCI), is used to exchange the pressure and displacement information between Fluent and Abaqus to perform a loosely coupled aeroelastic analysis. The optimization criteria include both deterministic and probabilistic constraints with both structural and aerodynamic uncertainties, such as in yield strength, Mach number, and angle of attack. To evaluate the probability of failure for the probabilistic constraints a first-order reliability analysis method, the Hasofer–Lind iteration method, is implemented in MATLAB to compute the most probable failure point solution. The integrated framework is validated with structural problems and then extended to more realistic wing configurations with aeroelastic criteria. The presented reliability-based multidisciplinary optimization process is proven to be fully automatic, modular, and practical, which could find potential applications in industrial problems.",50,3

Two open-bay door configurations were considered: both doors open and the outboard door closed. The partially closed case produced broadband and tonal noise levels up to 20 dB higher than the fully open bay. At Mach 0.75, a noise suppression method employing both a longitudinal baffle and the fluidic spoiler at a flow rate of was found most effective with overall sound pressure level reduction of 16 dB, and a dominant tone reduction of 15 dB. At Mach 1.5, a suppression method employing both the fluidic spoiler and the aft wall suction was found most effective with overall and tonal reductions of 10 and 15 dB, respectively. Analysis of the spatial distribution of the pressure in the bay was performed using proper orthogonal decomposition, and it demonstrated that the effective suppression did not alter the distributions, which corresponded to those typical of open cavity flows.",50,3

An integrated store-separation-dynamics suite has been developed and applied to study the separation of an air-to-air missile from a fighter aircraft. The suite consists of a preprocessor to generate connectivity using overlapped unstructured grids, a three-dimensional grid-free Euler solver to obtain aerodynamic forces and moments on the missile and a six-degrees-of-freedom solver to integrate the equations of motion. A quasi-steady approach has been used to simulate the separation dynamic of rail-launched missile. The motion of the missile guided by the rail launcher has been modeled using constrained-force method and implemented in the six-degrees-of-freedom code. The surface transpiration boundary condition has been incorporated in the Euler solver to mimic the aerodynamic damping and the relative motion of the missile with respect to the aircraft. The store-separation-dynamics suite has been applied to obtain the trajectory of the missile at various aircraft launch-envelope conditions.",50,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031859,"In this paper, a novel aeroservoelastic effector configuration that is actuated by piezoelectric tabs is presented. The effector exploits trailing-edge tabs installed on free-floating flaps (FFFs). These flaps are used to prevent flutter from occurring and to alleviate loads originating from external excitations such as gusts. A vertical tailplane wind-tunnel model with two free-floating rudders and a flutter control mechanism were designed, and the aeroelastic stability and response characteristics have been modeled numerically. The controller uses the tailplane tip acceleration as a sensor and sends control signals to the piezoelectrically actuated tabs. Wind-tunnel experiments were performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the technology. It was demonstrated experimentally that the flutter speed associated with the free rudders could be increased by 80%. The same controller, applied to the external rudder, was used to alleviate the aeroelastic response of the tailplane to the excitation of the other rudder, which resulted in a significant decrease in the root bending moment of the tailplane. The results indicate that the FFFs can be very effective in alleviating gust responses and also can be used to prevent freeplay-related limit-cycle oscillations, which are typical for tailplane–rudder combinations.",50,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031878,"The design requirements for a next-generation commercial aircraft can do much to secure its fate as a success or failure. New aircraft are often designed to meet or surpass the capabilities of an existing aircraft they are intended to replace. However, in the case of unconventional aircraft, this could lead to significant overdesign resulting in nonviable concepts. Instead, a method of analyzing observed aircraft use is presented with the intent of establishing a set of requirements based on replacing aircraft utility instead of capability. Two aircraft in the commercial fleet are used as example cases, and launch customers for each aircraft are assumed. Data originating from diverse sources are combined to present a probabilistic representation of aircraft use. The data collected include the payloads carried, ranges flown, and assigned cruise altitudes as well as the field length, elevation, and hot day characteristics of the airports used, and the launch customers’ fleet size history. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the compiled aircraft use data are used to justify a set of requirements for a replacement aircraft, which differ substantially from the established performance of the existing aircraft. New aircraft designed to these requirements are expected to be smaller and less expensive than those designed to the original aircraft’s capabilities.",50,3

To this purpose, a series of numerical analyses at were performed in order to obtain the best shape and location of the suction/blowing slot in terms of aerodynamic efficiency and maximum lift gain with respect to the baseline.

8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031937,"A low-speed experimental investigation detailing the design and evaluation of a self-contained circulation-control wing is presented. A moderate aspect-ratio wing (3.34) utilizing a low-Reynolds-number S8036 profile was tested at . The trailing-edge jet was produced using two internal impellers drawing air off the wing tips. The effect of trailing-edge bluntness was examined as was the jet’s quiescent characteristics. Achievable jet-momentum coefficients were low, limiting circulation control to the boundary-layer control regime. Force-balance testing indicated that the circulation-control system could achieve a moderate zero-lift angle-of-attack shift; however, the primary effect of the jet was flow control at high incidence, in which stall was delayed significantly. The blunt trailing edge (Coanda surface) caused a significant increase in the minimum drag coefficient, reducing both the range and endurance parameters.",50,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031943,A tetrahedral mesh generation method for acquiring accurate sonic boom pressure signatures several body lengths from an aircraft model has been developed. The method serves as a tool for aerodynamicists to efficiently create useful meshes for sonic boom analysis. The procedure includes generating a refined near-field grid with a cylindrically shaped boundary that encompasses the model just beyond its surface and a prismatic mesh from the cylindrical boundary to the far field. Projecting the boundary in the radial direction and forming prisms between neighboring layer faces creates the prism mesh. Each prism is subdivided into three tetrahedra resulting in a mesh comprised entirely of tetrahedral cells. The prism structure permits radial stretching and mesh alignment with the Mach cone around the aircraft model for accurate on- and offtrack signatures. Computational results for four models compared with experimental data validate this methodology.,50,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031981,"The measurement and prediction of the aerodynamic performance of airfoils and wings at chord Reynolds numbers below are both difficult and increasingly important in the application to small-scale aircraft. Not only are the aerodynamics strongly affected by the dynamics of the unstable laminar boundary layer, but the flow is decreasingly likely to be two-dimensional as the Reynolds number decreases. The spanwise variation of the nominally two-dimensional flow along a two-dimensional geometry is often held to be responsible for the large variations in the measured profile drag coefficient at this scale. Here, local two-dimensional drag coefficients are measured along a finite wing using nonintrusive particle image velocimetry methods. Variations in can be related to local flow variations on the wing itself. Integrated values can then be compared with direct force balance data, and the dynamical significance of spanwise variability will be reevaluated.",50,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031991,"A method for the optimization of a nonplanar airplane wing shape with respect to the total of induced and profile wing drags is presented. Optimization is performed subject to the lift constraint and one of the following: fixed span; fixed arc length; or fixed wing root bending moment. A planar wing is demonstrated to be the optimal solution in all cases for which the profile drag contributes most to the total drag. In the cases of fixed span and fixed root bending moment calculations, the emergence of nonplanar wings occurs as the optimal solution when the induced drag becomes the more significant component. This is marked by a break point in which the induced and profile drags are comparable.",50,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032000,"The continuous-descent approach is among the key concepts of the Next Generation Air Transportation System. Although a considerable number of researchers have been devoted to the estimation of potential fuel savings of the continuous-descent approach, few have attempted to explain the fuel savings observed in field tests from an analytical point of view. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the continuous-descent approach as a fuel-reduction procedure. This research gives insights into the reasons why the continuous-descent approach saves fuel, and design guidelines for the continuous-descent-approach procedures are derived. The analytical relationship between speed, altitude, and fuel burn is derived based on the base of aircraft data total-energy model. A theoretical analysis implies that speed profile has an impact as substantial as, if not more than, vertical profile on the fuel consumption in the terminal area. In addition, the continuous-descent approach is not intrinsically a fuel-saving procedure: whether the continuous-descent approach saves fuel or not is contingent upon whether the speed schedule is properly designed or not. Based on this model, the potential fuel savings due to the continuous-descent approach at the San Francisco International Airport are estimated, and the accuracy of this estimation is analyzed.",50,3

A proper quantification of the induced damage will enable a simultaneous comparison among various structural materials based on their dynamic responses in the simulated lightning environment. As an initial approach, evolution of damage was investigated in the lightning quasi electrostatic fields with the ensuing formation of the thermal plasma discharge characterized by the 200–500 A current in the 0.14–3.86 s time range in the unpainted aluminum cathodes at atmospheric pressure in air. Development of damage followed the kinetics law, where the process rate constant, , expressed as a dimensionless quantity of the relative change in damage volume or in material residual ultimate tensile strength, showed independence on current amplitude or material’s thickness with . Comparison of the damage volume and material’s loss through ablation suggested formation of damage as a result of metal melting.

17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032020,"An efficient method to analyze a low-aspect-ratio composite wing with a control surface is developed in this paper. To reduce the problem size and the computational cost, two special schemes are applied. The first is an equivalent-plate methodology and the second is an expanded type of component-mode synthesis. An equivalent-plate analysis was adopted for a semimonocoque main wing, which consists of skins, spars, and ribs, and a thin solid control surface. The main wing and control surface were connected by torsional springs, and the expanded component-mode synthesis was used to combine these two separate components with torsional springs. The first-order shear-deformation theory of plates was the basis of the present equivalent-plate analysis, and a finite element method was applied to solve it. To validate this development, a free-vibration analysis for a cantilevered plate with torsional springs was conducted. Various semimonocoque wings were analyzed, and the results were compared with those using MSC Nastran. A further complex three-dimensional analysis for a composite wing with a control surface was then conducted. The results were compared with those obtained from MSC Nastran to demonstrate the levels of accuracy and the reduction of the problem size.",50,3

The objective of this research was to investigate how large levels of freestream turbulence affect a fixed wing in a low-speed turbulent flow. This paper specifically focuses on time-averaged mean load measurements of wings with three aspect ratios in highly turbulent and low-turbulence baseline flows. Relevant findings are that the presence of turbulence decreases the mean lift for an aspect ratio of 1 wing while increasing the mean lift for an aspect ratio of 2 and 4 wings. The stall angle of attack was increased for all aspect ratios investigated. Turbulence also modifies pitching moments to behave more smoothly than baseline cases. The standard deviations of the loads were found to be constant across the angle of attack, but the rolling moment was significantly increased with increasing aspect ratios.",50,3

In an attempt to approximate passenger impact in formation flight, a simple aerodynamic model for two aircraft in formation was developed. The wing trailing vortices were assumed to shift in an ideal fashion within atmospheric turbulence resulting in aerodynamic disturbance loads acting on the trailing aircraft. As the sensitivity of the human body to vibrations is frequency dependent, a spectral representation of atmospheric turbulence was incorporated. Monte Carlo simulations were done for various levels of turbulence intensity. The predicted acceleration responses of the trailing aircraft were used to determine the passenger comfort levels by applying the criteria of standard 2631-1 from the International Organization for Standardization and comparing with comfort levels experienced in an aircraft flying in isolation in the same turbulent atmosphere. A significant increase in discomfort was predicted for the lateral separations corresponding to the location for optimum drag benefit.

First, the traditional, sequential approach in which a satisfactory control system is designed for a given helicopter is applied. Then, a novel approach, in which the helicopter and control system are simultaneously designed, is applied to redesign the entire system. This redesign process involves selecting certain helicopter parameters as well as control system parameters. For both design procedures the key objectives are to minimize control energy and satisfy prescribed variance constraints on specific outputs. In order to solve the complex optimization problem corresponding to the simultaneous design approach, an efficient solution algorithm is developed by modifying the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation method to account for limits on optimization parameters. The algorithm is applied to redesign helicopters using models generated in straight level as well as maneuvering flight conditions.

These flights, usually flown during the summer months in the central and high plains in the United States, targeted regions of convective storms containing vigorous updrafts, downdrafts, and precipitation, including hail. Observations indicate that three of the most hazardous components of flying in summertime deep convective clouds are aircraft icing, turbulence from strong vertical wind gradients, and hail. There is also a smaller, but still important, threat from lightning. Statistics of the observations show that at any given time there is approximately a 10% probability of encountering severe icing conditions, approximately a 0.1% probability of encountering extreme turbulence, and approximately a 0.2% probability of encountering hail with mean diameter 2.5 cm or greater within convective clouds in the 4–7 km mean sea level altitude range.

25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032074,"The previous works of Prandtl, Jones, and Klein and Viswanathan addressed the problem of determining the lift distribution that minimizes induced drag for a given lift and specified bending moment. In these formulations, bending moment is considered to be a surrogate for wing weight. These classical methods require the bending constraints to be imposed at the same lift coefficient at which drag is minimized. In practice, however, it is commonly desired to minimize drag at a representative cruise lift coefficient while imposing the bending constraints at a limiting structural load condition, such as a maneuver lift coefficient. This paper presents an approach to extend the classical methods by allowing the bending constraints to be imposed at different lift coefficients than that at which induced drag is minimized. An example for a wing planform similar to that of a Boeing 737 shows that the penalty for optimizing induced drag at the maneuver lift coefficient as implied in the classical methods results in between a 1–10% increase in drag at cruise compared to the results from this new approach. It is expected that the new approach will enable the classical methods to be extended to practical applications in multidisciplinary wing design.",50,3
