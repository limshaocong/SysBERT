The paper focuses on the contribution aircraft operations make to those goals. It describes a multiobjective optimization methodology intended to support the planning of environmentally efficient departure procedures. The methodology treats the problem as a multiobjective optimal control problem that is solved through the application of a direct method of trajectory optimization and a multiobjective version of the differential evolution algorithm. The method generates Pareto fronts between several competing objectives, allowing the decision maker to make informed decisions about potential tradeoffs between different environmental goals. The methodology is demonstrated through its application to a real-world many-objective procedure optimization study. The method supports in-depth analysis of the problem not achievable through existing methods and is used to identify a solution set that offers improvements in all environmental objectives relative to the existing procedure design.",55,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034281,"This paper presents the concept and design of an on-board decision support tool for planning energy recovery strategies in time-constrained descents. The recovery advisories generated by the tool enables crew to capture altitude and speed targets at selected constraint points along the descent using a combination of adjustments in both the vertical and lateral flight trajectories. The energy recovery problem is formulated as a parameter optimization problem that allows consideration for various maneuvers, including speed adjustments, changes in aerodynamic configuration, and alterations to the remaining flight distance. The resulting problem is then solved using static optimization techniques. The results show that a feasible recovery solution is always identified and large energy deviations can be recovered with minimal violation of arrival time at the fix.",55,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034368,"A method is proposed for modeling average generic vehicles for fleet-level analysis of technology impacts on environmental metrics. Vehicles are grouped into classes distinguished by aircraft-level metrics, which include fuel burn (a surrogate of carbon dioxide emissions), nitrogen oxide species emissions, and sound exposure level noise contours. Target metrics are established for a subset of 94 airports by designing a series of tests of sequentially increasing complexity, with ideal average generic vehicle models minimizing the error distributions across these airports when aircraft-level performance is aggregated to fleet levels. A Latin hypercube design of experiments is employed to explore the aircraft-level design space and construct surrogate models for each metric. Monte Carlo samplings of these surrogate models are paired with desirability functions to rapidly identify locations in the design space that simultaneously match aggregate fuel burn, emissions, and day/night-level contours. In general, the average generic vehicles provide greater accuracy for each of these metrics across the 94 airports for a representative six weeks of operations as compared to the traditional approach of choosing a representative vehicle per class. These average generic vehicles can be paired with a fleet-level tool, where the baseline models represent current technology aircraft and serve as virtual testbeds for projecting impacts of future technology implementation.",55,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034422,"This paper describes the conceptual design and evaluation results of both manual and automatic variants of an aircraft upset-recovery system that has been assessed by experienced airline pilots. The two system variants provide additional layers of protection to what currently exists in aircraft flight-control systems. Apart from the manual pilot-assisted guidance variant, the other variant takes over full automatic control of the aircraft when it accidentally enters an upset due to a range of potentially catastrophic loss of control in-flight scenarios (e.g., crew incapacitation, adverse atmospheric conditions, and onboard system failures). The aim of the piloted-evaluation campaign was to assess the added value of the different upset-recovery-guidance variants in a relevant operational environment, and how well they relieve or assist the pilot in recovering the aircraft, hence bringing the aircraft back into the safe flight envelope following an upset. An initial assessment was made in terms of the preference of the tested automatic upset-recovery system configurations to reduce pilot workload, increase situation awareness, and allow safe interaction with the manual or automated system for upset recovery. The piloted-simulator results show that the functionalities of the system adequately support pilots during upset recovery. Specifically, the automatic modes have the highest impact on workload reduction, situation awareness, stress reduction, and acceptability. The study shows that longer-term solutions for upset-recovery guidance and loss-of-control prevention should focus on automatic solutions in combination with visual-guidance and monitoring cues.",55,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034378,"Due to the coupled nature of aircraft design, it is important to consider all major subsystems when optimizing a configuration. This is difficult when each individual subsystem model can be arbitrarily complex. By restricting an optimization problem to have a certain mathematical structure, significantly more effective and tractable solution techniques can be used. Geometric programming, one such technique, guarantees finding a globally optimal solution. Although it has been shown that geometric programming can be used to solve some aircraft design problems, the required formulation can prove too restrictive for certain relationships. Signomial programming is a relaxation of geometric programming that offers enhanced expressiveness. Although they do not guarantee global optimality, solution methods for signomial programs are disciplined and effective. In this work, signomial programming models are proposed for optimal sizing of the wing, tail, fuselage, and landing gear of a commercial aircraft. These models are combined together to produce a system-level optimization model. Signomial programming’s formulation allows it to handle some key constraints in aircraft design, and therefore an improvement in fidelity over geometric programming models is achieved. A primary contribution of this work is to demonstrate signomial programming as a viable tool for multidisciplinary aircraft design optimization.",55,3

The model is formulated as a signomial program, which is a type of optimization problem that can be solved locally using sequential convex optimization. Signomial programs can be solved reliably and efficiently and are straightforward to integrate with other optimization models in an all-at-once manner. To demonstrate this, the turbofan model is integrated with a simple commercial aircraft sizing model. The turbofan model is validated against the Transport Aircraft System Optimization turbofan model as well as two Georgia Institute of Technology Numerical Propulsion System Simulation turbofan models. Four integrated engine/aircraft parametric studies are performed, including a multimission optimization with over 2400 variables that solves in under 4 s.",55,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033860,"Characterization of nonlinear slosh loads in aircraft remains a challenging problem. This work benchmarks a frozen fuel mass model against computational fluid dynamics data across a complete flight envelope. Thereafter, a novel surrogate reduced-order model aimed at improving on frozen fuel mass predictions is proposed. For a given tank geometry, the surrogate reduced-order model employs computational fluid dynamics simulations from which limit state slosh loads may be computed. These are calculated as a function of the mode of excitation (vertical or lateral), fill level, excitation frequency, and excitation amplitude. The resulting response surface is then described via a kriging interpolation-based surrogate reduced-order model. The surrogate is combined with a novel metric for the amplification factor (the ratio of the actual load to that induced by a frozen fuel mass) to predict the transient slosh-induced force due to arbitrary gust-type excitations. The latter is characterized as a priori in terms of acceleration amplitude and frequency via Fourier decomposition. It is demonstrated that the proposed surrogate reduced-order model improves the accuracy in predicting lateral slosh-induced loads by an average of 150% as compared to a frozen fuel mass model for a range of excitations, while being conservative.",55,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034573,"A hybrid control technique combining both proportional derivative (PD) and adaptive integral backstepping (AIB) control strategies is proposed for position control within a building-generated wind wake. Position hold performance for a quadrotor (, ) within windfields obtained from large-eddy simulations are used to compare control strategies. Simulated results show that both the PD and AIB control approaches can outperform each other depending on position within the wake. Over multiple positions within a wake, simulations show the hybrid approach reduces the average volume within which the vehicle remains by approximately 50% over both an exclusively PD or AIB control approach. Simulations also show the hybrid approach can hold the quadrotor to within an average of approximately one body length of the desired position compared to one to two body lengths using a PD control and two body lengths using an AIB control. Flight tests performed using PD and hybrid approaches confirm the improved position hold ability of the hybrid controller in building wake environments. Flight data show the hybrid controller reduces the average volume within which the vehicle remains bounded by approximately 50% compared to the volume obtained using the PD controller.",55,3

Both single rotating propellers and contrarotating open rotors are investigated. The related structural subsystems are modeled through finite element analyses; the aerodynamic subsystems exploit a finite volume, full potential formulation suitable for unsteady transonic flows. An ad hoc technique is developed for simulating the flowfield around a contrarotating open rotor configuration. The effectiveness of the proposed aeroelastic analysis is successfully assessed for single propellers through comparisons with reference numerical and experimental data available in the literature, as well as against Euler flow-based solutions. The results for contrarotating open rotors cannot be validated because of the lack of corresponding open-literature data.",55,3

One such system, based on a standard round canopy with a slightly modified rigging, was developed and demonstrated in the early 2000s. This paper capitalizes on controllable round canopy developments and considers using inexpensive cruciform-type canopies with a single-actuator control paradigm. Although the aerodynamics of cruciform-type canopies were extensively studied in the past, lesser efforts were devoted to converting them into a steerable platform. This paper presents the conceptual design and prototyping of a cruciform parachute-based aerial payload delivery system and discusses the results of the initial subscale developmental tests devoted to studying the control authorities and dynamics of such a system.",55,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034415,"A computational study has been conducted on various airfoils to simulate flows at Reynolds numbers primarily between and to provide understanding and guidance for MAV and other low-Reynolds-number designs. The computational fluid dynamics tool used in this study is a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver with a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model and a correlation-based laminar–turbulent boundary-layer transition model. The airfoils investigated in this study include NACA 0009, NACA 0012 (conventional and reversed configuration), Clark-Y, flat plate airfoils (1, 3, and 5% thickness), and thin cambered plates (3, 6, and 9% camber). Airfoils were examined for lift and drag performance as well as surface pressure and flow field characteristics. In general, it is observed that below the Reynolds number of , lift and drag characteristics for most airfoils cannot be assumed to be constant with the Reynolds number. Below the Reynolds number of , cambered plate airfoils are shown to have better lift and drag characteristics than thick conventional airfoils with rounded-leading edges. Flat plate performance is generally invariant to the Reynolds number, but performance improves as thickness is decreased for a given Reynolds number.",55,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034483,"The increasing usage of low-Reynolds-number (10,000–100,000 tip Reynolds number) scale quadrotors for civilian and military applications provides the impetus for the development of reliable design methodologies. At present, there is limited understanding of how to accurately size quadrotor components for a specific mission. These components include the rotors, motors, speed controllers, batteries, and airframe. However, empirical relationships may be derived for these components based on manufacturer data. The present research identifies the key factors driving vehicle weight and provides a framework for implementing these factors in a micro air vehicle design tool. Starting from basic rotor parameters (such as radius, solidity, and airfoil section) and an initial gross takeoff weight estimate, a blade element momentum theory framework coupled with computational-fluid-dynamics-generated sectional airfoil tables provides an acceptable estimate of low-Reynolds-number rotor power and torque for required thrust. The aerodynamic power and torque along with desired flight time and speed drive the weights of the quadrotor components. The proposed sizing tool has been validated against a series of existing quadrotors with 30–1000 g gross takeoff weights. Current results show that individual weight groups can be predicted generally within a deviation and the gross takeoff weight of each vehicle is predicted within a variation.",55,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034171,"The generation of shock waves is inevitable in supersonic cruise, which results in the generation of wave drag as well as sonic boom on the ground. Some innovative concepts such as the supersonic biplane concept and the supersonic twin-body fuselage concept have been proposed recently to reduce the supersonic wave drag dramatically. In this study, the aerodynamic and sonic-boom performance of innovative supersonic transport wing–body configurations is discussed by numerical approaches. The wing section shape of a Busemann biplane wing/twin-body model is optimized at a design Mach number of 1.7 and angle of attack of 2 deg. The optimized results show the tradeoff between aerodynamic performance (lift/drag ratio) and sonic-boom performance (maximum overpressure of sonic-boom distribution). It is confirmed that aerodynamic performance is mainly affected by the thickness difference between the upper/lower wings. Then, the trailing-edge shape of the upper wing has also a significant influence on aerodynamic performance. On the other hand, sonic-boom performance is mainly affected by the lower surface shape of the lower wing, to make the pressure wave pattern of “expansion–compression”, which can attenuate the pressure waves propagating to the ground.",55,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034529,"For most turboprop transport and passenger airplanes, the engine nacelle is connected directly to the lower surface of the wing, which causes unfavorable effects on the aerodynamic performance of the airplane. Through numerical simulations, the influence of a wing-mounted engine nacelle on the high-lift performance of a typical twin-engine turboprop regional airliner is investigated. Compared with a clean wing situation, a wing-mounted engine nacelle reduces the maximum lift coefficient of the landing configuration by 0.24 and makes the stall characteristic steeper. The mechanism that causes such loss of performance is mainly four unfavorable effects, which coupled act on the high-lift system. Reducing the installation height of the engine nacelle can partly recover the performance loss, but also brings significant penalty for cruise efficiency. By modifying the intersection area, the lift performance of the high-lift configuration can be raised to almost the same level, but the drag performance of the cruise configuration is not substantially deteriorated.",55,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034473,"Delta-canard shapes allow for maneuverable, supersonic combat aircraft. A configuration of medium aspect ratio was investigated to extend its maneuverability to very high angle of attack. Here, leading-edge vortex flows with intense interaction and breakdown effects dominate the flow. To appreciably enhance the maneuverability beyond limits, aerodynamic means had to be found. In-depth understanding of the interactions of the vortex systems was necessary to improve the aircraft capabilities. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations simulations were performed via the unstructured DLR-Tau code. The aircraft was modeled without compromising geometrical details. It was found that asymmetric vortex breakdown features and unfavorable interactions at sideslips are the cause of the limited maneuverability. Means were deduced to control the vortex systems to mitigate or even avoid previous limits. This was done via a combination of theoretical thinking and computational fluid dynamics flow simulations. Aerodynamic means to control the lateral stability were investigated. Wind-tunnel tests secured this process. Small but effective fuselage strakes and leading-edge root extensions between the canard and the wing enhanced the lateral stability considerably. Much higher angle of attack can be reached for increased maneuverability. The design concept was confirmed through intense wind-tunnel campaigns and successfully flown in a test program covering the envelope.",55,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034430,"Simulation results are presented for a C-130 aircraft configured to perform cargo airdrop operations. Flight operations with the cargo ramp open lead to strong vortical flow structures and unsteady flows, which can adversely affect airdrop operations and parachute deployments. The results document complex wake structures formed behind the C-130 with the cargo ramp open at 0 and 50% flap settings. In particular, the wake contains two asymmetric counter-rotating vortices formed between the open ramp and the upsweep section of the aircraft and near the rear edges of the ramp. The flow separates along these edges because of the sharp turn that flow makes as it enters the cargo compartment. The separated flow then rolls up into two vortices. These vortices move outward and upward, and then they pass very near the lower surface of the horizontal stabilizer. These vortical flows lead to unsteady airloads on the horizontal stabilizer, and thus the aircraft. The wake effects are larger behind the upper upsweep section and are minimum at the lower positions. Grid and time sensitivity studies are performed for several geometries to ensure numerical simulations are accurate for the separated and vortical flows. The results show that, as the grid becomes more refined in the region behind the upsweep section of the aircraft, the localized wake structures and unsteady effects are better captured by the flow solver.",55,3

By leveraging wing flexibility, wing-mounted distributed propulsion can be used to re-twist wing shapes in-flight to improve aerodynamic efficiency. A multidisciplinary approach is used to develop an aero-propulsive-elastic model of a highly flexible wing distributed propulsion transport aircraft. The conceptual model is used to evaluate the aerodynamic benefit of the distributed propulsion aircraft. The initial conceptual analysis shows that an improvement in the aerodynamic efficiency quantity of lift-to-drag ratio is possible with the proposed aeroelastic wing shaping control for distributed propulsion aircraft. Two concepts are studied: single-generator configuration and dual-generator configuration with four propulsors per wing. The baseline aircraft model is NASA Generic Transport Model. A fan performance analysis is developed for propulsion sizing. Cruise performance analysis is conducted to evaluate the potential improvement in the cruise range for the configurations under study. A flutter analysis is performed to address the potential flutter issue as the propulsors are placed toward the wing tip, which would cause a reduction in the wing natural frequencies.

The numerical propulsion system simulation environment is used to generate engine conditions for computational fluid dynamics analyses. Improvements to the boundary-layer ingestion geometry are made using the constrained direct iterative surface curvature design method. The potential benefits of the boundary-layer ingestion system relating to cruise propulsive power are quantified using a power balance method, and a comparison to the baseline case is made. Iterations of the boundary-layer ingestion geometric design are shown, and improvements between subsequent boundary-layer ingestion designs are presented. Simulations are conducted for a cruise flight condition of Mach 0.85 at an altitude of 38,500 ft, with a Reynolds number of 40 million based on the mean aerodynamic chord and an angle of attack of 2 deg for all geometries. The results indicate an 8% reduction in engine power requirements at cruise for the boundary-layer ingestion configuration as compared to the baseline geometry. Small geometric alterations of the aft portion of the fuselage using constrained direct iterative surface curvature are shown to marginally increase the benefit from boundary-layer ingestion further, resulting in an 8.7% reduction in power requirements for cruise, as well as a drag reduction of approximately 12 counts over the baseline geometry.",55,3

First, the finite element analysis of the key components of the steering mechanism is carried out. Second, the reliability of the steering mechanism is analyzed through combining the dynamic simulation model and the first-order second-moment method based on an artificial neural network. Additionally, the analytical results of reliability and parameter sensitivity show that the steering mechanism has very high reliability, and the turning moment and load torque are the factors that have great influence on the reliability of the steering mechanism. Third, an environmental test system is designed for the reliability test of this nose landing gear. After 300,000 different-temperature environmental tests, the high reliability of the landing-gear steering mechanism is verified. It can be known from the test data that the failure data of the steering mechanism are in accordance with the bathtub curve law in each environmental test, and the temperature has a significant impact on the reliability of the steering mechanism. This paper’s work provides a consolidated test basis and method for analyzing and verifying the performance and reliability of other aircraft landing-gear systems.",55,3

This motivates a more detailed study of the boundary layer ingestion propulsor design, which requires considering the fully coupled airframe propulsion integration problem. However, boundary layer ingestion studies thus far have accounted only for the aerodynamic effects on the propulsion system, or vice versa, but have not considered the two-way coupling. This work presents a new approach for building fully coupled aeropropulsive models of boundary layer ingestion propulsion systems. A one-dimensional thermodynamic cycle analysis is coupled to a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation. This aeropropulsive model is used to assess how the propulsor design affects the overall performance for a simplified model of the single-aisle turboelectric aircraft with an aft boundary-layer propulsor. The results indicate that both propulsion and aerodynamic effects contribute equally toward the overall performance and that the fully coupled model yields substantially different results compared to the uncoupled model.

22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034401,"The use of active flow control technology for augmentation of aircraft aerodynamic performance is of considerable interest to the aerospace industry. Research to date has included subscale and full-scale wind-tunnel experiments as well as limited flight-test demonstrations. Out of several possible applications of active flow control to commercial aircraft, this paper focuses on its application to high-lift devices, which may permit weight and drag reduction through simplification of the flap mechanism. These, however, must be traded off against the additional weight of the active flow control system, its power requirements, and redundancy considerations to assess net system-level impacts. In this work, the Integrated Subsystem Sizing and Architecture Assessment Capability is used to assess the system-level impact of multiple high-lift device active flow control architectures for a small twin-aisle aircraft. A comparative assessment of these architectures reveals a strong dependency of fuel burn performance and the identity of the best-performing architecture on the system total mass flow requirements. For a selected architecture, the impact of the system mass flow requirements on the off-design performance is investigated. Despite an increase in vehicle operating empty weight, fuel consumption still decreases for most missions in the payload–range envelope. Finally, the sensitivity of the architecture’s performance to several sources of uncertainty is ascertained through a sensitivity analysis, and it is observed that the uncertainty in estimation of flap track fairing drag has the most significant impact on the estimation of mission fuel burn.",55,3

Parawings are conically shaped geometries that possess significant washout and camber variation across the span. A series of models with a planar leading-edge sweep of 55 deg increasing to 65 deg to form the parawing canopy were tested. Asymmetric wing tests were also conducted to explore the ability of the configurations to generate moments suitable for roll control. The results indicate a significant reduction in lift with increasing wing slackness stemming from both a reduction in the lift curve slope and positive shift in the zero-lift angle of attack. The angle of attack for zero lift is shown to correlate strongly with the peak lobe height. Asymmetric wing setting showed the generation of rolling moments comparable in magnitude with those produced by traditional ailerons. Numerical simulation indicated that a freely available lifting-surface theory application is able to accurately simulate the performance of the parawing geometry.,55,3

As shown in the Results section, relationships between technical-only figures of merit hold and their behavior is even mathematically predictable. On the other hand, technical–financial relationships depend on market variables (price and market forecast, mainly) that can be captured only by proper market and financial models.

Given automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast intent information, the future state of potential intruder aircraft are predicted, and this nominal trajectory is used as a constraint in the ownship trajectory optimization process. In it, a continuous multiphase optimal control problem is solved, taking into account spatial and temporal constraints. Additionally, a linearized Kalman filter keeps track of the target by estimating the deviations of its actual trajectory from its nominal trajectory, issuing a warning when an appropriate threshold is exceeded. This may be due to unexpected events, biases in the performance and weather models, wrong parameter assumptions, etc. An illustrative example is given, based on a computer simulation of two hypothetical trajectories in the Barcelona terminal maneuvering area.

The drooped wing is a nonplanar configuration with downward spanwise camber from the wing root to the tip. The aerostructural optimization cases include two load conditions: cruise and . The single maneuver load condition is used for structural sizing of the wing. In all cases, the projected span of the wing remains unchanged. The results show that such a wing has the potential to improve aircraft range by 2.6% relative to an optimized planar wing of the same projected span. The reason is that the drooped wing pushes the tip vortex further away than the planar wing and increases the projected span at the deflected state. Furthermore, if the drooped wing is permitted to have curved leading and trailing edges, a 4.9% range improvement in comparison to an optimized planar wing with straight leading and trailing edges is possible by further reducing wing weight and wave drag.",55,3

The relationship of interface temperature and velocity is analyzed and fitted into a quadratic function. In most aviation ice accretion situations, the degree of nonequilibrium condition at the ice–water interface falls in a range of interfacial supercooling from 0 to 4 K.

The rotor employs hollow blades with slots for flow suction at the root and ejection at the tip. The centrifugal acceleration of the fluid created inside the blade by the rotational motion of the propeller is used to displace a considerable amount of flow momentum from the most inboard part of the blade to the tip. The particular technology is quite attractive because it does not require additional external power sources to drive the fluid. Test are performed in a low-speed wind tunnel with the propeller mounted at zero angle of attack. Oil-flow visualizations are used to characterize the change of the flow on the blade surface, whereas particle image velocimetry measurements are carried out to quantify the diffusion of the vorticity field obtained for three propeller advance ratios. Results show that the application of tip blowing considerably reduces the blade-tip vortex peak swirl velocity (33% for 0.24 propeller advance ratio) with a considerable increase in the vortex core radius (64% for 0.24 propeller advance ratio) and vortex diffusion.
