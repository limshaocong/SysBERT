5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031500,"This paper presents the design of a safety augmentation system for aircraft that prevents intrusions into a no-fly zone, representing a class of static external hazards. Additionally, when the risk of intrusion is most imminent, the system features an automated fail safe. Different from current alerting systems that only target the visual and aural communication channels, the safety augmentation system also uses the haptic channel to communicate its intent and to provide a smooth transition in control authority from human to machine. The goal of this paper was to investigate what combination of communication modalities would best fit such a system to benefit safety, performance, risk awareness, pilot workload, and acceptance. An experiment with 10 professional airline pilots in a fixed-base simulator showed that safety significantly increased when more communication channels were targeted, in which the visual information contributed most to the pilot’s risk awareness. Haptic feedback showed significant improvements in secondary-task performance, but it also frustrated pilots because the cues were not always clear. Subjective measurements revealed that, although hardly being activated, the automated fail safe gained low pilot acceptance as a means to increase safety.",51,1

Evaluating the robustness of new low-boom concepts is important for the conceptual design of supersonic aircraft. Here, robustness means that the aircraft configuration has a low-boom ground signature at both under- and off-track locations. An integrated process for under- and off-track sonic boom analysis is developed to facilitate the design of robust low-boom supersonic aircraft. The key enabler for sonic boom analysis is accurate computational fluid dynamics solutions for off-body pressure distributions. To ensure the numerical accuracy of the off-body pressure distributions, a mesh study is performed with Cart3D (an inviscid computational fluid dynamics solver) to determine the mesh requirements for off-body computational fluid dynamics analysis. Comparisons are made between the sonic boom analysis results conducted with the Cart3D and USM3D inviscid computational fluid dynamics solvers. The variation in the ground signature that results from changes in the location of the computational fluid dynamics off-body pressure distribution is also examined. Finally, a complete under- and off-track sonic boom analysis is presented for two distinct supersonic concepts to demonstrate the capability of the integrated analysis process.",51,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031551,"A promising path for developing a low-boom configuration is a multifidelity approach that starts from a low-fidelity low-boom design, refines the low-fidelity design with computational fluid dynamics equivalent-area analysis, and improves the design with sonic-boom analysis by using computational fluid dynamics off-body pressure distributions. The focus of this paper is on the third step of this approach, in which the design is improved with sonic-boom analysis through the use of computational fluid dynamics calculations. A new inverse design process for off-body pressure tailoring is formulated and demonstrated with a low-boom supersonic configuration that was developed by using the mixed-fidelity design method with computational fluid dynamics equivalent-area analysis. The new inverse design process uses the reverse propagation of the pressure distribution from a mid-field location to a near-field location, converts the near-field into an equivalent-area distribution, generates a low-boom target for the reversed equivalent area of the configuration, and modifies the configuration to minimize the differences between the configuration’s reversed equivalent area and the low-boom target. The new inverse design process is used to modify a supersonic demonstrator concept for a cruise Mach number of 1.6 and a cruise weight of 30,000 lb. The modified configuration has a fully shaped ground signature that has a perceived loudness value of 78.5, whereas the original configuration has a partially shaped aft signature with a perceived loudness of 82.3.",51,1

Simulations were conducted at Mach numbers of 0.5, 0.7, and 1.5. The discrete suction control generates and positions a large-scale counter-rotating vortex pair that induces a strong downwash over the hemispheric beam director. Flow attachment is maintained regardless of the position of the optical window and whether a shock is present. The density fluctuation in the wake is greatly reduced. Consequently, an improvement in the optical environment over the baseline can be expected for the Mach number range studied.",51,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031793,"The aviation industry lived through the global economic crisis by mergers and a review of cost cent factors. Maintaining a fleet is more delicate than ever because low price is the focus of demand, but providing safety is the greatest cost. These facts lead to dynamic maintenance of the aircraft in order to eliminate excessive maintenance costs while ensuring safety. Preemptive maintenance can be run only if the failure times of aircraft are predicted ahead of occurrence. This study aims to predict when the failure will happen by aircraft type and age. An application of 60 aircraft, which lived through 532 failures, is modeled with artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms, which are known to be the preferred forecasting tools. The model proposed gives a good forecast correlation rate between the target and actual failure schedules of aircraft.",51,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031807,"A highly efficient unsteady panel time-marching free wake is established to achieve fast and accurate prediction of the unsteady aerodynamics of a helicopter. The unsteady panel method is used to calculate the airload of rotor blades, and the free-wake method is applied to simulate the dynamics of rotor wake. The two methods are tightly coupled by convecting panels to vortex filaments, and the rotor wake is divided into three parts to reduce the computational cost. The first is shed wake indicated by doublet panels. The second is near-wake filaments, which are described by a series of vortex filaments attaching to the shed wake. The third is far-wake filaments connecting to the near-wake filaments. A velocity-field integration technique is adopted to overcome the singularity problem during the interaction of the rotor wake with blades. Helicopter rotors including the Caradonna–Tung and the AH-1G rotors are simulated in hover and forward flight to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the present approach. The predicted blade pressure and load distribution agree well with the measured data and computational-fluid-dynamics results in hover and low-speed forward flight. Compared to computational fluid dynamics and the traditional panel/vortex-rings free-wake method, the present method is more efficient.",51,1

The data used for this report consist of 5316 flight files, collected during the 2008 and 2009 fire seasons. Flights have been divided into multiple phases, separating the segments when retardant is dropped from others. Basic flight parameters such as airspeed, altitude, flight duration and distance, bank, and pitch angles are shown in statistical form. Vertical accelerations are used to construct diagrams for comparison with the manufacturers’ data. Airframe cycle times are shown to be approximately 45 min. Several coincident flight events are shown and compared with operational limits when available. The altitudes, the normal accelerations, and the airspeeds have not revealed any operation outside of the established boundaries. Relatively large dive and roll angles were prominently present during all but the drop phases. Nonetheless, they are shown to remain within the limits stated by the manufacturer or imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration type certificate data sheets. Cumulative occurrences of maneuver loads have been examined and compared with data from other sources when available. It is shown that the cumulative occurrences of maneuver load factor varies by flight phase, with the largest values associated with the drop and exit phases. For the overall flight, maneuver loads were shown to occur at lower frequencies than those stated in Military specification MIL-A-8866C(AS).",51,1

The hydrofoil for a sailing craft should have high lift at lower speeds and low drag at higher speeds. Computations are performed for a hydrofoil in deep water as well as one close to the free surface. Commercially available software is employed for calculation of the flowfield. It is shown that the genetic algorithm based shape optimization technique is capable of accurately and efficiently finding globally optimal hydrofoils.",51,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032045,"A phenomenological noise-modeling method called Fundamental Rotorcraft Acoustic Modeling from Experiments is used to demonstrate the changes in rotor harmonic noise generation of a helicopter operating at different ambient conditions. The method is based upon a nondimensional representation of the governing acoustic and performance equations of a single-rotor helicopter. Measured external noise is used together with parameter-identification techniques to develop a model of helicopter external noise that is a hybrid between theory and experiment. The method is used to evaluate the main rotor harmonic noise of a Bell 206B3 helicopter operating at different altitudes. The variation with altitude of blade–vortex interaction noise, known to be a strong function of the helicopter’s advance ratio, depends upon which definition of airspeed is used. If normal flight procedures are followed and indicated airspeed is held constant, the true airspeed of the helicopter increases with altitude. This causes an increase in advance ratio and a decrease in the speed of sound, which results in large changes to blade–vortex interaction noise levels. Additionally, thickness noise on this helicopter becomes more intense with increasing altitude. The noise magnitude and directivity variations differ when flight conditions are defined by true airspeed. These results suggest that existing empirical helicopter rotor noise-source models may give incorrect noise estimates when they are used at conditions where data were not measured and may need to be corrected for mission land-use planning purposes.",51,1

15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032131,"The mathematical model and experimental verification of flexible propeller blades are presented in this paper. The propeller aerodynamics model is based on an extended blade-element momentum model, while the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory and Saint–Venant theory of torsion are used to account for bending and torsional deformations of the blades, respectively. The proposed blade-element momentum model extends the standard blade-element momentum theory with the aim of providing a quick and robust model of propeller action capable of treating high-aspect-ratio propeller blades with a blade axis of arbitrary geometry. Based on the proposed mathematical model, a static flexible propeller blade design procedure and its associated analysis algorithm are established. Dynamic aeroelastic phenomena like propeller flutter and divergence are not covered by the presented mathematical model, design, and analysis algorithm. Experimental validation was carried out with an objective of evaluating the performance of the developed mathematical model and the design strategy. Both theoretical and experimental results are presented along with pertinent concluding remarks.",51,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032130,"A model of a three-dimensional dual-sidestay landing gear mechanism is presented and employed in an investigation of the sensitivity of the downlocking mechanism to attachment point deflections. A motivation for this study is the desire to understand the underlying nonlinear behavior, which may prevent a dual-sidestay landing gear from downlocking under certain conditions. The model formulates the mechanism as a set of steady-state constraint equations. Solutions to these equations are then continued numerically in state and parameter space, providing all state parameter dependencies within the model from a single computation. The capability of this analysis approach is demonstrated with an investigation into the effects of the aft sidestay angle on retraction actuator loads. It was found that the retraction loads are not significantly affected by the sidestay plane angle, but the landing gear’s ability to be retracted fully is impeded at certain sidestay plane angles. This result is attributed to the landing gear’s geometry, as the locklinks are placed under tension and cause the mechanism to lock. Sidestay flexibilities and attachment point deflections are then introduced to enable the downlock loads to be investigated. The investigation into the dual sidestay’s downlock sensitivity to attachment point deflections yields an underlying double-hysteresis loop, which is highly sensitive to these deflections. Attachment point deflections of a few millimeters were found to prevent the locklinks from automatically downlocking under their own weight, hence requiring some external force to downlock the landing gear. Sidestay stiffness was also found to influence the downlock loads, although not to the extent of attachment point deflection.",51,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032150,"This paper presents multipoint high-fidelity aerostructural optimizations of a long-range wide-body transonic transport aircraft configuration. The aerostructural analysis employs Euler computational fluid dynamics with a 2-million-cell mesh and a structural finite-element model with 300,000 degrees of freedom. The coupled adjoint sensitivity method is used to efficiently compute gradients, enabling the use of gradient-based optimization with respect to hundreds of aerodynamic shape and structural sizing variables. The NASA Common Research Model is used as the baseline configuration, together with a wing box structure that was designed for this study. Two design optimization problems are solved: one where takeoff gross weight is minimized, and another where fuel burn is minimized. Each optimization uses a multipoint formulation with five cruise conditions and two maneuver conditions. Each of the optimization problems have 476 design variables, including wing planform, airfoil shape, and structural thickness variables. Optimized results are obtained within 36 h of wall time using 435 processors. The resulting optimal configurations are discussed and analyzed for the aerostructural tradeoffs resulting from each objective. The takeoff gross weight minimization results in a 4.2% reduction in takeoff gross weight with a 6.6% fuel burn reduction, whereas the fuel-burn optimization resulted in an 11.2% fuel burn reduction with no significant change in the takeoff gross weight.",51,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032195,"Schemes for anisotropic grid adaptation for dynamic overset simulations are presented. These approaches permit adaptation over a periodic time window in a dynamic flowfield so that an accurate evolution of the unsteady wake may be obtained, as demonstrated on an unstructured flow solver. Unlike prior adaptive schemes, this approach permits grid adaptation to occur seamlessly across any number of grids that are overset, excluding only the boundary layer to avoid surface manipulations. A demonstration on a rotor/fuselage-interaction configuration includes correlations with time-averaged and instantaneous fuselage pressures, and wake trajectories. Additionally, the effects of modeling the flow as inviscid and turbulent are reported. The ability of the methodology to improve these predictions is confirmed, including a vortex/fuselage-impingement phenomenon that has before now not been captured by computational simulations. The adapted solutions exhibit dependency based on the choice of the feature to form the adaptation indicator, indicating that there is no single best practice for feature-based adaptation across the spectrum of rotorcraft applications.",51,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032206,"Velocities measured in turbulent boundary layers over yawed flat plates confirmed that the mean velocity profiles normal to the leading edge are proportional to the velocity profiles parallel to it, with a proportionality constant depending on the yaw angle. This turned out to be the necessary and sufficient condition to make the wall stress components normal and parallel to the leading edge also proportional in the same manner, thus reaffirming the boundary-layer independence principle for turbulent and laminar flows alike. Reinterpretation of old experiments thus changed the mantra stating, “the independence principle does not apply to turbulent flow”, thus providing a new insight into three-dimensional boundary-layer flows on yawed, high-aspect-ratio wings. It explains the prevalence of attached spanwise flow near the trailing edges of such wings, and it provides a rationale for turbulence modeling on them. Furthermore, it indicates the direction along which active separation control should take place.",51,1

The theoretical methods used are the potential-flow/integral boundary-layer methods XFOIL 6.96 and PROFIL07 and the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver OVERFLOW 2.2e. This version of the OVERFLOW solver contains an implementation of the transitional shear-stress transport turbulence model developed by Langtry and Menter (“Correlation-Based Transition Modeling for Unstructured Parallelized Computational Fluid Dynamics Codes,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 47, No. 12, 2009, pp. 2894–2906). This model is capable of capturing the influence of transition on the flowfield through a local-correlation method. The airfoils considered for this study are the E 387, S805, PSU 94-097, HTR1555, S903, and S824. Although none of the theoretical methods considered were consistently the best overall, all codes predicted the drag well in the low-drag regions of these airfoils and the codes incorporating integral boundary-layer methods generally agreed better with the experimental data. The methods also all showed inconsistencies in predicting the maximum lift coefficient, with XFOIL and OVERFLOW frequently overpredicting this value.",51,1

First, the aeroelastic stability of a typical section representative of a control surface on a hypersonic vehicle is examined. Variability in the uncoupled natural frequencies of the system is modeled using beta probability distributions. Uncertainty in the flutter Mach number is computed using stochastic collocation. Next, the stability of an aerodynamically heated panel representing a component of the skin of a hypersonic vehicle is considered. In this case, uncertainty is due to the location of transition from laminar to turbulent flow and the heat flux prediction. The effect of propagating these uncertainties on vehicle behavior is determined. For both cases, uncertainty is treated using stochastic collocation, which is a new and effective approach for incorporating uncertainty in this class of problems.",51,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032251,"Autonomous guided airdrop systems based on steerable ram-air parafoils rely on differential deflection of the canopy trailing edge for lateral control with very limited longitudinal control. This work explores an alternative method that achieves both lateral and longitudinal control by shifting the center of gravity of the payload relative to the canopy rigging attachments. A multibody simulation model is required to capture the complex motion associated with the flexible nature of the parafoil, payload, and rigging system and simulate the effects of both longitudinal and lateral shifting of the center of gravity. Simulation results show that longitudinal weight shift can be an effective means of providing airspeed and glide slope control, and lateral weight shift can be an effective means of providing turn rate control. Results demonstrate that, for both lateral and longitudinal control, spreading the attachment points of the rigging to the payload will cause the aircraft to be more sensitive to shifts in the payload center of gravity. It was also found that, for both lateral and longitudinal control, decreasing the vertical distance from the rigging attachments to the center of gravity on the payload causes the aircraft to be more sensitive to shifts in the payload center of gravity. Finally, dynamic results demonstrate that the forces and moments required to induce a weight shift in the payload will often cause an initial response in the opposite direction of the final steady-state response.",51,1

Conflicting disciplines and technologies are always involved in aerospace systems design processes. Multicriteria Decision Analysis techniques can help decision makers to effectively deal with such situations and make wise design decisions. There is a variety of existing methods; thus, selection of the most appropriate method is critical because the use of inappropriate methods is often the cause of misleading design decisions. In this paper, an appropriateness index is used to quantify the goodness of a method for solving the problem under consideration. This method selection approach is implemented and an intelligent knowledge-based system is developed consisting of a multicriteria decision analysis library storing widely used decision analysis methods and a knowledge base providing the information required for the method selection process. Furthermore, a new approach for uncertainty assessment in the decision analysis process is proposed in this study. This novel approach for uncertainty assessment can be used to aggregate input data from tools with different fidelity levels and is capable of propagating uncertainties in an assessment chain.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032304,"Comparisons between one-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses are conducted systematically for advanced geometry blades, which have tip sweep, tip taper, and planform variations near the root with various materials and effects of boundary conditions in order to better understand the differences between the two approaches and the physics behind them. One-dimensional beam analysis is conducted using the rotorcraft comprehensive analysis system with variational asymptotical beam sectional analysis calculated two-dimensional cross-sectional properties. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is conducted using a commercial code MSC/Marc. Natural frequencies are calculated at various rotor rotational speeds, and the differences are quantified. There is very good agreement between the one-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses for free–free aluminum beams, even for a very short beam with beam length five times chord . The one-dimensional analysis accurately captures the planform variation near the root for an aluminum beam. In general, the differences between the one-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses occur when there is coupling, either generated from geometry (tip sweep) or material (composite), especially for high-frequency modes. Without coupling, the one-dimensional analysis appears to capture free vibration characteristics of various advanced geometry beams and blades reasonably well for at least the six lowest frequency modes when the beam length is greater than 10 times chord.",51,1

26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032307,"Preliminary design studies indicate that a cruise-efficient short takeoff and landing aircraft has enhanced takeoff performance at competitive direct operating costs when using high-speed propellers in combination with internally blown flaps. The original tractor configuration is compared to an over-the-wing propeller, which allows for noise shielding. An additional geometry with partially embedded rotor similar to a channel wing is considered to increase the beneficial interaction. This paper shows the aerodynamic integration effects with a focus on climb performance and provides an assessment of the three aforementioned configurations for a simplified wing segment at takeoff conditions. Steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations have been conducted using an actuator disk model and were evaluated based on the overall design. Interacting with the blown flap, the conventional tractor propeller induces large lift and drag increments due to the vectored sliptream. Although this effect is much smaller for an over-the-wing configuration, by halving the lift augmentation, the lift-to-drag ratio and the propulsive efficiency are considerably improved. Besides a moderate lift gain, the main advantage of a channel wing design is the location of the thrust vector close to the center of gravity resulting in a smaller nosedown pitching moment due to thrust. A disadvantage of over-the-wing propellers is the inhomogeneous inflow at higher velocity, which leads to oscillating blade loads and reduced efficiency.",51,1
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032324,"Under certain conditions during takeoff and landing, pilots may sometimes experience vibrations in the cockpit. Because the cockpit is located right above the nose landing gear, which is known to potentially be prone to self-excited vibrations at certain velocities, an explanation for those vibrations might be oscillations of the landing gear feeding into the fuselage. However, the fuselage dynamics itself may also influence the dynamics of the landing gear, meaning that the coupling must be considered as bidirectional. A mathematical model is developed to study a coupled nose-landing-gear–fuselage system, which allows to assess the overall influence of the coupling on the system dynamics. Bifurcation analysis reveals that this interaction may be significant in both directions and that the system behavior depends strongly on the modal characteristics of the fuselage.",51,1
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032334,"A relevant outcome of aircraft vulnerability assessment is the identification of the vulnerability importance of components for survivability design. However, when comparing the contribution of the components to the whole aircraft vulnerability, there is no accepted criterion regarding the component vulnerability. This work is aimed at investigating how importance measures in the field of reliability can be accounted for in the ranking of vulnerable components. The traditional importance measures (e.g., Birnbaum, Fussell–Vesely, criticality, reliability achievement worth, and reliability reduction worth) are modified to rank the component vulnerability. Three examples of increasing complexity are provided. Analysis shows that the traditional single-hit vulnerable area criterion is a special case among the proposed importance measures, and it can only apply for the nonredundant aircraft model with no component overlap; the importance measures can be applied to rank the component vulnerability of a complex aircraft (i.e., redundant aircraft model with component overlap). Another important aspect different from reliability analysis is that, in an overlap region, the change of the vulnerability of one component will probably lead to the change of the vulnerability of the shielded components, and in the process of computing the vulnerability importance measure metrics, this chain reaction should be considered.",51,1
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032341,"A model-reduction method for linear, parameter-varying systems based on parameter-varying balanced realizations is proposed for a body freedom flutter vehicle. A high-order linear, parameter-varying model with hundreds of states describes the coupling between the short period and first bending mode with additional structural bending and torsion modes that couple with the rigid body dynamics. However, these high-order state–space models result in a challenging control design, and hence a reduced-order linear, parameter-varying model is desired. The objective is to reduce the model state order across the flight envelope while retaining a common set of states in the linear, parameter-varying model. A reduced-order linear, parameter-varying model with tens of states is obtained by combining classical model reduction and parameter-varying balanced realizations reduction techniques. The resulting reduced-order model captures the unstable dynamics of the vehicle and is well suited for the synthesis of active flutter suppression controllers.",51,1
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032349,"Integration is ubiquitous in systems development. Although much has been written about the need to explicitly characterize integration in the context of technology development and maturation, current technology readiness level evaluation methods do so implicitly or altogether incorrectly. It is argued that integration is an inherent subattribute of technology readiness and that technology readiness level descriptions hold some of the conceptual building blocks with which such an explicit characterization of integration may be constructed. To do so, the concept of integration in the context of technology maturation is elaborated on, drawn from well-established published work to generate characterizations of integration for each readiness level. These descriptions build upon fundamental concepts of systems integration such as system architectures, abstraction, interfaces, and interactions. The use of these generic descriptions to create specific ones for a representative emerging technology in aeronautics is illustrated. Lastly, the proposed approach is compared to prior work, and the case is made for the former’s advantages in benchmarking integration for a current assumed technology readiness level and articulating integration goals for higher levels of technology readiness.",51,1

The present study focuses on the most frequent damage type, dent, and uses probabilistic approaches to analyze statistical characteristics of the damage based on maintenance data from a Chinese airline. Dent sizes are considered from three dimensions: the damage diameter, the damage depth, and the diameter/depth ratio. The life-cycle strength of a composite structure is obtained by Monte Carlo simulation, and the probability of failure is quantified corresponding to different inspection intervals. Maintenance cost is introduced, as another criterion, to optimize inspection intervals from both safety and economy. This method enables the dent damage to be assessed quantitatively, which can facilitate engineers from airlines or manufacturers to evaluate the damage tolerance of the composite structure and adjust their related inspection schedules flexibly.",51,1

Because such a simulation requires high computational processing unit time, researchers are looking for alternative methods to simulate adhesive joints of aircraft structures for saving the computational processing unit time. Another high computational processing unit requiring the study of aircraft structures is the evaluation of delamination growth in adhesive joints and crack propagation in brittle materials using cohesive zone modeling along with the very fine finite element mesh for the bulk material. To reduce these computational times, a possible alternative is to use a global–local finite element method. Therefore, both the crack propagation and the characteristics of adhesive joints were studied using a global–local finite element method. Three cases were studied using the proposed global–local finite element method, including 1) an adhesively bonded double cantilever beam, 2) an adhesive lap joint, and 3) a three-point bending test specimen. Using global–local methods, in a crack propagation problem of an adhesively bonded double cantilever beam, more than 80% data storage space and more than 65% computational processing unit time requirement could be saved. In the adhesive lap joints, around 70% data storage space and 70% computational processing unit time requirement could be saved using the global–local method. For the three-point bending test specimen case, more than 90% for both data storage space and computational processing unit time requirement could be saved using the global–local method.",51,1

These filters are highly effective at collecting solid and liquid particulates. Identification of engine oil contaminants arriving through the bleed air system on the filter was chosen as the initial focus. A two-step study was undertaken. First, a compressor/bleed air simulator was developed to simulate an engine oil leak, and samples were analyzed with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. These samples provided a concrete link between tricresyl phosphates and a homologous series of synthetic pentaerythritol esters from oil and contaminants found on the sample paper. The second step was to test 184 used aircraft filters with the same gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry system; of that total, 107 were standard filters, and 77 were nonstandard. Four of the standard filters had both markers for oil, with the homologous series synthetic pentaerythritol esters being the less common marker. It was also found that 90% of the filters had some detectable level of tricresyl phosphates. Of the 77 nonstandard filters, 30 had both markers for oil, a significantly higher percent than the standard filters.",51,1
