1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034906,"The development of a wing–body–nacelle–pylon–horizontal-tail configuration for a common research model is presented, with the focus on the aerodynamic design of the wing. A contemporary transonic supercritical wing design is developed with aerodynamic characteristics that are well behaved and of high performance for configurations with and without the nacelle–pylon group. The horizontal tail is robustly designed for dive Mach number conditions and is suitably sized for typical stability and control requirements. The fuselage is representative of a wide-body commercial transport aircraft; it includes a wing–body fairing, as well as a scrubbing seal for the horizontal tail. The nacelle is a single-cowl high-bypass-ratio flowthrough design with an exit area sized to achieve a natural unforced mass flow ratio typical of commercial aircraft engines at cruise. The simplicity of this un-bifurcated unpowered nacelle geometry facilitates experimental data collection and grid generation efforts for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) validations. Detailed aerodynamic performance data are provided; however, this information was originally presented in such a manner as to not bias CFD predictions planned for the fourth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop in 2009 (DPW-IV); the DPW-IV incorporated this common research model into its blind test cases. The fifth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop in 2012 and the sixth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop in 2016 also used this configuration as the basis of their test cases. The CFD results presented include wing pressure distributions with and without the nacelle–pylon Mach lift-to-drag ratio (ML/D) trend lines, as well as the drag-divergence curves. The design point for the wing–body configuration is within 1% of its maximum ML/D. The original plans to test the common research model in the National Transonic Facility at NASA Langley Research Center and the 11-by-11 ft wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center are discussed. Furthermore, wind-tunnel models have been replicated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab, the University of Washington, as well as by numerous other laboratories. A Web site has been established to collect, archive, and freely provide wind-tunnel data from these various experimental campaigns. The geometry definition has been extended to include a high-lift system. It has been used to form the basis for experimental swept-wing icing studies. Finite element models have been developed for the wind-tunnel environment, as well as to be more representative of a full-scale aircraft in flight. A simple search for technical papers related to this configuration yields thousands of results. Needless to say, with a decade in retrospect, the NASA Common Research Model has significantly exceeded the initial most-optimistic goals, and it has become the de facto standard test case for present-day transonic CFD validations.",55,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034856,"Results from the Sixth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop: Case 1 Code Verification are presented. This test case is for the turbulent flow over a two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence models. A numerical benchmark solution is available for the standard Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model that can be used for code verification purposes. There are 31 data submissions from 16 teams: 23 with the SA model (various versions), 4 with -omega SST (two variants), and one each with , -epsilon, an explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model, and the lattice Boltzmann method with very large eddy simulation. Various grid types were employed including structured, unstructured, Cartesian, and adapted grids. The benchmark numerical solution was deemed to be the correct solution for the 21 submissions with the standard Spalart–Allmaras model, the Spalart–Allmaras without the term variant, and the negative Spalart–Allmaras mode variant. Although many of these 21 submissions demonstrate first-order convergence on the finer meshes, others either showed nonconvergent solutions in terms of the aerodynamic forces and moments or converged to the wrong answer. Results for this case highlight the continuing need for rigorous code verification to be conducted as a prerequisite for design, model validation, and analysis studies.",55,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034409,"Results from the Sixth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop Cases 2 to 5 are presented. These cases focused on force/moment and pressure predictions for the NASA Common Research Model wing–body and wing–body–nacelle–pylon configurations. The Common Research Model geometry differed from previous workshops in that it was deformed to the appropriate static aeroelastic twist and deflection at each specified angle of attack. The grid refinement study and nacelle–pylon drag increment prediction (Case 2) used a common set of overset and unstructured grids, as well as user-created multiblock structured, unstructured, and Cartesian-based grids. Solutions were requested for both the wing–body and wing–body–nacelle–pylon at a fixed Mach number and lift coefficient. The wing–body static aeroelastic/buffet study (Case 3) specified an angle-of-attack sweep at finely spaced intervals through the zone where wing separation was expected to begin. The optional Case 4 requested grid adaption solutions of the wing–body at a specified flight condition. Optional Case 5 requested coupled aerostructural wing–body solutions. Results from this workshop highlight the progress made since the last workshop, and the continuing need for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) improvement, particularly for conditions with significant flow separation. These comparisons also suggest the need for improved experimental diagnostics to guide future CFD development.",55,4

The test case focuses on a static aeroelastic simulation of NASA’s Common Research Model civil transport aircraft in the wing/body configuration (i.e., without engines, pylons, and empennage). Flow conditions include the design point lift coefficient at cruise flight. Aeroelastic simulations are performed on the “medium” baseline grid, coupled to a computational structural analysis, using either an existing finite element model or modal data. Experimental validation data for this test case are available from a wind-tunnel test campaign performed at the European Transonic Wind Tunnel in Cologne, Germany.",55,4

The solutions were obtained by code developers and users from North America, Europe, Asia, and South America using both common and custom grid sequences, as well as multiple turbulence models. The aerodynamic configuration for the workshop was the Common Research Model, which is a subsonic transport wing–body previously used for both the Fourth and Fifth Drag Prediction Workshops. This work continues the statistical analysis begun in the earlier workshops and compares the results from the grid-convergence study of the most recent workshop with previous workshops. Most notably, the results demonstrate that predicted drag increments show less scatter between codes than the predicted absolute values of drag for a given configuration, and also serve to reinforce a lesson learned from the Fifth Drag Prediction Workshop regarding the importance of a common grid sequence in decreasing the solution variation regardless of the computed output quantity.",55,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034428,"A method for modifying the shape of digital geometry representations used in computer-aided design applications according to experimental pointwise deflection data is described. In the pilot study presented here, the method is applied to the computer-aided design geometry of an aircraft wing that is deformed using measured deflections obtained from the associated wing model during a wind-tunnel test. The method provides various advantages in computational fluid dynamics and other applications. Numerical grids generated on the deformed geometry yield an improved correlation of computational fluid dynamics results to wind-tunnel data without the need for aeroelastic computations, which require coupling to a structural model. Additionally, the method is beneficial in aerodynamic optimization, where the optimized shape is usually given in the form of a computational fluid dynamics surface mesh or nodal deflections that, for further processing or manufacturing purposes, need to be transferred into a computer-aided design geometry description. The paper presents an application to NASA’s Common Research Model transport aircraft configuration, where deformation measurements from a test campaign in the European Transonic Wind Tunnel are processed to provide deformed computer-aided design geometries for the Sixth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop.",55,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034486,"Structured-grid solutions obtained for the NASA Common Research Model for the Sixth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop are detailed. Three different flow solvers were used among the contributors, and the numerical methodologies and turbulence modeling strategies employed by each code are described. Key results for all authors include grid convergence studies for the drag increment of a nacelle and pylon added to a wing–body configuration and a buffet study accounting for static aeroelastic deformation. Additional studies performed include feature-based adaptive mesh refinement and higher-order convective flux discretization, among others.",55,4

The flow solvers were run on a sequence of fixed unstructured grids built for the 6th AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop (DPW-6) and compared with solutions generated on solution adaptive grids. The fixed and adaptive mesh generation processes and resulting grids and solutions are presented and discussed. Both approaches achieve asymptotic grid convergence of less than two counts of drag. The fixed grid approach is based on gridding guidelines developed over many years of CFD application experience on similar applications and required an expert user several weeks of effort to develop a grid family conforming to the guidelines. In contrast, the adaptive grid approach is automatic, relying on an estimate of solution discretization error to guide grid construction. The adaptive grids were generated with less than 2 days of user interaction, requiring very few user decisions and almost no expert knowledge.",55,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034421,"Three mixed-element unstructured Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solvers, the TAS code, FaSTAR, and Cflow, were applied to the Sixth AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop test cases to investigate the accuracy of the solvers with committee-provided grids and custom participant-generated grids by MEGG3D, BOXFUN, and the Cflow built-in grid generator. Solutions were obtained for the verification study using the two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil (test case 1), the NASA common research model nacelle–pylon drag incremental study (test case 2), and the common research model wing/body static aeroelastic effect study (test case 3). In test case 1, the three solvers used the same turbulence model, the Spalart–Allmaras one-equation turbulence model without the trip term for transition and without the ft2 function, and their grid convergence trends for lift, drag, and pitching moment coefficients were similar to that of FUN3D, CFL3D, and TAU. In test case 2, the TAS code with the NASA GeoLab grids and with MEGG3D grids, FaSTAR with the NASA GeoLab grids, and Cflow with its own grids predicted nacelle–pylon drag increment well. In test case 3, the three solvers predicted force and moment fairly comparable with experiment if support system interference effects were considered.",55,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034481,"The Common Research Model wing/body configuration is investigated with the k-kL-MEAH2015 turbulence model implemented in FUN3D. This includes results presented at the Sixth Drag Prediction Workshop and additional results generated after the workshop with a nonlinear quadratic constitutive relation variant of the same turbulence model. The workshop-provided grids are used, and a uniform grid refinement study is performed at the design condition. A large variation between results with and without a reconstruction limiter is exhibited on “medium” grid sizes, indicating that the medium grid size is too coarse for drawing conclusions in comparison with experiment. This variation is reduced with grid refinement. At a fixed angle of attack near design conditions, the quadratic constitutive relation variant yielded decreased lift and drag compared with the linear eddy-viscosity model by an amount that was approximately constant with grid refinement. The k-kL-MEAH2015 turbulence model produced wing–root junction flow behavior consistent with wind-tunnel observations.",55,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034370,"Numerical investigations of the NASA Common Research Model from the 6th AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop are performed with in-house solver MFlow. The solver is based on a cell-centered finite volume method and is capable of handling various element types. Hybrid grids supplied by the committee and generated in-house are used in the simulations. Grid convergence properties, polar lines, and pressure distributions are analyzed and compared with experimental data. A nearly linear convergence property is achieved with grid refinement for own-generated hybrid grids. The drag increment due to nacelle and pylon is well predicted. As angle of attack increases, the simulations with the original Spalart–Allmaras or shear-stress transport model exhibit a large side-of-body separation, whereas the results obtained with quadratic constitutive relation present a negligible separation bubble, which is more reasonable judging from experimental data. The solver shows good agreement with experiment. The predictions are much improved with the static aeroelastic effect considered in simulations.",55,4

The context for the development of this unique new method is briefly described. The results of a grid convergence study are presented and discussed, and it is shown that the numerical method is capable of accurately predicting incremental drag changes. The occurrence of unsteady flow at higher angles of attack during an alpha sweep for the model including static aeroelastic wing deformations is discussed. Buffet is already shown to start locally on the wing for angles of attack considered for the workshop. Additional simulations for higher angles, deep into the buffet range and close to the high-speed stall of the model, are also shown and highlight the method’s capability to handle highly unsteady flows with massive turbulent separations.",55,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034414,"This paper aims to present some of the experimental and numerical results obtained with the NASA–Boeing Common Research Model at ONERA. The wind tunnel model used in the present study is the ONERA Large Reference Model (1/16.835), which has the same geometry as the Common Resarch Model considered in the latest AIAA Drag Prediction Workshops. Experimental data have been collected from the ONERA-S1MA wind tunnel at Mach numbers between 0.30 and 0.95 and a mean aerodynamic chord Reynolds number of 5 million for four different configurations: wing/body only and wing/body with horizontal or vertical tails or both. Force and moment and pressure and surface flow measurements have been performed. Concerning the numerical study, all the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations have been completed with the structured solver elsA, and the Spalart–Allmaras and with shear stress transport turbulence models have been used in addition to the quadratic constitutive relation. In this paper, configuration effects (increments due to horizontal and/or vertical tails) are assessed both numerically and experimentally for several Mach numbers and angles of attack. The delicate issue of flow separation at the wing/body junction is also addressed with the support of oil flow visualizations. elsA and S1MA skin pressure distributions are presented; the agreement is satisfactory except for some outboard wing sections at high lift levels. Finally, comparisons of drag and moment values including computational fluid dynamics and test data from different wind tunnels are proposed (S1MA, NASA Ames Research Center and National Transonic Facility, and European Transonic Wind Tunnel).",55,4

Different configurations of the well-known Common Research Model have been used to perform drag analyses and increment assessments. The structured overset grids provided by The Boeing Company to the DPW community have been preprocessed with the in-house software Cassiopée: CGNS conversion, cell blanking, and overlapping issues have been handled before running these grids with the RANS solver elsA and the far-field code ffd72. Contrary to the original CRM configuration used in DPW-5, the wing shape is now based on wind-tunnel aeroelastic measurements: through a grid convergence process, a four-count drag increment between new and former wing–body geometries has been quantified, which is very consistent with previous ONERA results. Then, a CRM configuration including a throughflow nacelle–pylon installation has been computed: the corresponding drag increment of about 22 counts is in very close agreement with the NASA experimental data. Finally, horizontal and vertical tails have been added to the wing–body–nacelle–pylon geometry so that the aerodynamic performance of such a complete cruise configuration can be assessed. Numerical considerations involving the SA-QCR2000 turbulence model are highlighted.",55,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034675,"Structural optimization with a flutter constraint for a vehicle designed to fly in the transonic regime is a particularly difficult task. In this speed range, the flutter boundary is very sensitive to aerodynamic nonlinearities, typically requiring high-fidelity Navier–Stokes simulations. However, the repeated application of unsteady computational fluid dynamics to guide an aeroelastic optimization process is very computationally expensive. This expense has motivated the development of methods that incorporate aspects of the aerodynamic nonlinearity, classical tools of flutter analysis, and more recent methods of optimization. Although it is possible to use doublet-lattice method aerodynamics, this paper focuses on the use of an unsteady high-fidelity aerodynamic reduced-order model combined with successive transformations that allows for an economical way of using high-fidelity aerodynamics in the optimization process. This approach is applied to the common research model wing structural design. The high-fidelity aerodynamics produces a heavier wing than that optimized with doublet-lattice aerodynamics. It is found that the optimized lower wing skin thickness distribution using high-fidelity aerodynamics differs significantly from that using doublet-lattice aerodynamics.",55,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034645,"Aeroelastic systems including all-moving control surfaces and aircraft wings with stores may experience limit cycling caused by nonlinear structural and/or aerodynamic mechanisms. These systems are examined here via two different and complementary models, with nonlinear wing-root and nonlinear wing-store attachments, respectively, subjected to linear potential flow aerodynamic forces. Limit-cycle responses are obtained through an efficient computational method based on harmonic balance by using the spatially localized (hence mathematically separable) nature of the assumed nonlinearities. Results pertaining to a cubic hardening or softening restoring force in stiffness or damping, freeplay, and Coulomb friction are discussed along with confirmatory time-marching responses for selected cases. Clear relationships are established between the linear flutter behavior and the limit-cycle responses corresponding to each nonlinearity.

17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034581,"This paper presents the development of a new framework of multiblock structured elliptic grid smoothing for full-aircraft configurations. The framework is fully automated and applies different solvers on blocks based on their properties. Blocks with a solid wall are initialized by algebraic orthogonal grids and solved with a line SOR implicit elliptic solver. The remaining blocks are initialized by transfinite interpolation grids and solved with an SOR explicit elliptic solver. Both solvers apply spacing and curvature source terms. This combination results in orthogonal grids close to walls while imposing elliptic spacing and curvature control using variable relaxation factors in the field, including across the block boundaries. The orthogonality close to the solid walls is improved by using the properties of the initial algebraic orthogonal grids. The code is parallelized using Message Passing Interface for acceleration. The performance of the framework is demonstrated in a first step on 2D problems: a canonical test case and a multi-element high-lift airfoil. In a second step, the performance is analyzed on a full three-dimensional aircraft configurations (wing/body/engine) case at Bombardier Aerospace. The paper examines the effect of the proposed approach through various assessments of grid metrics and flow solver behaviors. In particular, the study highlights the improvements in reducing spurious drag through a far-field drag analysis.",55,4

This is achieved thanks to a compact residualized modal projection of the aeroelastic equations of motion, including large (geometrically nonlinear) wing deflections, that is used to describe the vehicle dynamics. This study shows that a model-predictive control system can then be built with an internal model based on successive linearization of the equations of motion around the instantaneous vehicle geometry. Significant improvements in stability against large disturbances and maneuverability are demonstrated on numerical simulations of a very flexible flying wing when geometrically nonlinear effects are included in the internal model of the controller.",55,4

The model evaluates maintenance costs at a subsystem level in order to quantify the effective impact of each aircraft part on the total maintenance cost. An analysis at the subsystem level can offer a more precise cost estimation because the most influential parameters (that is, the cost drivers) should be different for each aircraft part. Emphasis is given on the updating of a cost-estimating model proposed in 1966 that provided equations for the maintenance cost assessment at a subsystem level using the Air Transport Association nomenclature. The reference method is enhanced with additional cost items, and the choice of cost drivers is accurately considered.

20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034718,"An investigation into an aerodynamic optimization benchmark case that exhibits multimodality is presented using a global optimization approach. The recently suggested case 6 of the AIAA Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group involves the drag minimization of a rectangular NACA0012 wing subject to lift and the root bending moment, as well as other geometric constraints. In this paper, optimization of that case using a state-of-the-art constrained population-based global optimization framework is presented. Shape control is achieved via a hierarchical application of the radial basis function domain element approach. Three different fidelities of optimization cases are performed to investigate the multimodality of various aspects of the full problem, with four independent runs of each case being performed. When considering chord optimization, the optimizer converges to two independently identifiable minima with very similar performances. When adding dihedral and sweep variation, further multimodality is introduced, although this multimodality is reasonably well defined, with minima including forward and rearward sweeps, and an upward and a downward winglet. Introducing thickness variables leads to a highly multimodal problem due to the coupling between the chord and thickness variables. The theoretical minimum drag for this case is 24.7 counts, which a number of the runs gets close to achieving.",55,4
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034754,"This paper investigates the ride quality for persons located within a trail aircraft flying in formation behind a lead aircraft to obtain fuel savings. As the trail aircraft flies at the optimum location with the largest fuel-saving benefits of formation, also termed the “sweet spot,” it is subjected to a nonuniform induced wind field generated by the wingtip vortices of the lead. It is important to study the effect of this nonuniform wind field on the levels of comfort for passengers and crew located within the trail as it flies within and outside the aerodynamic influence of the lead aircraft. In this paper, aircraft formation pairs subjected to varying atmospheric conditions are modeled and simulated using different trail aircraft types. The ride quality/comfort levels are computed for persons at various locations within the trail aircraft in accordance with International Organization for Standardization Standard ISO 2631-1 (“Mechanical Vibration and Shock–Evaluation of Human Exposure to Whole-Body Vibration—Part 1: General Requirements,” Geneva, 1997). It is demonstrated that, if a trail aircraft flies at the sweet spot and is subjected to the nonuniform induced wind field and/or atmospheric turbulence, the comfort levels are comparable to flight outside the aerodynamic influence of the lead aircraft with no additional detrimental impact, in terms of ride quality, to persons on board the trail aircraft.",55,4
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034696,"An experimental analysis was performed of the unsteady aerodynamic loading caused by the impingement of a propeller slipstream on a downstream lifting surface. When installed on an aircraft, this unsteady loading results in vibrations that are transmitted to the fuselage and are perceived inside the cabin as structure-borne noise. A pylon-mounted tractor–propeller configuration was installed in a low-speed wind tunnel at Delft University of Technology. Surface-microphone and particle-image-velocimetry measurements were taken to quantify the pressure fluctuations on the pylon and visualize the impingement phenomena. It was confirmed that the propeller tip vortex is the dominant source of pressure fluctuations on the pylon. Along the path of the tip vortex on the pylon, a periodic pressure response occurs with strong harmonics. The amplitude of the pressure fluctuations increases with increasing thrust setting, whereas the unsteady lift coefficient displays a nonmonotonic dependency on the propeller thrust. The lowest integral unsteady loads were obtained for cases with approximately integer ratios between the pylon chord and the wavelength of the perturbation associated with the propeller tip vortices. This implies that structure-borne-noise reductions might be obtained by matching the pylon chord with an integer multiple of the axial separation between the propeller tip vortices.",55,4

To this goal, an aeroservoelastic reduced-order model is generated. The model capitalizes on two key aspects: a dimensional reduction through proper orthogonal decomposition, further enhanced via balanced truncation, and an analytically derived mechanism to reproduce the gust effects in the reduced-order model. The compact model in state-space form thus obtained was then used for control design synthesis. Assuming that information on the structural motion only is accessible for feedback, a linear quadratic regular was designed first on the reduced model and then validated on the large computational model. Results are presented for two configurations: an aerofoil and the modified AGARD 445.6 wing, both with a trailing-edge control surface.

Furthermore, this work explores the effect of implementing trajectory constraints as a supplementary input to the multidisciplinary design optimization process and presents a method that enables the optimization of the aircraft under a three-dimensional flight scenario.

The operability limits computed include the maximum values of flight Mach number, dynamic pressure, and the flight time before one of several temperature limits is exceeded. To compute operability limits, efficient aerodynamic heating and thermal protection system models were added to the reduced-order model MASIV, which contains an advanced combustion analysis and a trim code. Results show the effects of varying the thickness of the three-layer thermal protection system that consists of a radiation shield, an insulation layer, and the vehicle wall. Results also show the effect of varying the fraction of fuel in the active cooling system that is recirculated back into the fuel tank. Recirculating the heated fuel raises the fuel tank temperature and decreases the fuel density (increasing the volume); the analysis computes the maximum flight time before the fuel tank temperature and fuel volume exceed acceptable limits. By extending the active cooling system to a small region of the inlet (instead of just around the combustor), the operability limits are increased from a flight Mach number of 7.3 to 8.6.",55,4

Three experimental sources are used to validate the multibody model. The influence of the number of blades, their stiffnesses, and their skin thicknesses are investigated. At high pitch angles, before stall and flexibility effects occur, increasing the number of blades produces more thrust for the same power. Flexibility and skin thickness considerably affect the required pivot rod strength and blade deformation. Simply supported blades exhibit severe deformations when compared to clamped blades. Thrust and power are both influenced in a similar and moderate way by flexibility. The rotor response to wind gusts is also analyzed. The angular velocity of the rotor significantly affects the response of the rotor to wind gusts. The direction of the gusting wind has an important influence on power, whereas thrust increases regardless of wind direction. Finally, the rotor response lags minimally behind the arrival of the gust.",55,4

Predictions using Euler-based local piston theory are compared to Euler solutions for the deformed geometry. Moderate to large deformations are investigated for the leeside wing on a cruciform wing/body configuration. It is shown that local piston theory is suitable even for large deformations, with the perturbation downwash/Mach number supersonic, provided that the loading induced by deformation is not dominated by interaction with body vortices or other sources of aerodynamic interference. Second-order local piston theory is recommended for deformations producing downwash/Mach numbers approaching sonic. The influence of the choice of piston theory coefficients is in producing an estimation band for the local piston theory load prediction, with insignificant influence on the load slope in the present investigation. In conclusion, local piston theory is put forward as a viable alternative to mesh deformation toward reduction of the computational cost of aerodynamic load prediction for static aeroelasticity, provided that perturbation loads are dominated by local twist and not by vortex interaction.",55,4
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034702,"The present study investigates possible lift gains generated by spanwise-varied blowing on a high-lift configuration equipped with a droop nose and a Coanda flap. Two types of numerical simulations are performed and compared: unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations and improved delayed detached-eddy simulations with algebraic sensors. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations achieve the best actuation settings at an actuation amplitude of 25% of the jet slit height and an actuation frequency of . No relevant sensitivity is detected with regard to the phase shift of the actuated spanwise segments. In contrast, the algebraic improved delayed detached-eddy simulations results show clear sensitivity to actuation phase shift. The algebraic improved delayed detached-eddy scale-resolving simulations also exhibit different wake dynamics from those of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes. Based on both the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and algebraic improved delayed detached-eddy simulations results, this study demonstrates the benefits that the superposition of a two-dimensional periodic actuation component (no phase shift between actuated segments) has on the lift. The benefits of three-dimensional segmented actuation remain unknown and await further research.",55,4
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034208,"The objective of this research is to investigate the efficacy of circulation control (CC) at low Reynolds numbers with relatively low and high blowing rates on a circulation control wing (CCW). Four dual-radius flap geometries are developed and tested by varying specific flap parameters from a previously studied baseline configuration. A two-dimensional low-speed wind-tunnel experimental study is undertaken to evaluate the effect of trailing edge upper slot blowing at cruise flight and takeoff (0° and 30° flap deflection). The wind tunnel tests are conducted at Mach numbers of 0.03, with momentum coefficients of blowing ranging from 0.0 to 0.3. The research presented in this paper is the natural outgrowth of results reported in previous work related to the wind tunnel testing of a CCW with dual-radius flaps. This investigation explores the design of CC dual-radius flaps to improve the performance of existing CC flap configurations. This research also provides insight into how the characteristics of the CC flap geometry affect CC performance.",55,4
