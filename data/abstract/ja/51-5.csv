1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032149,"The most frequently used excess attenuation method for noise contour models is called the lateral attenuation correction. This empirical method disregards varying atmospheric conditions. It is known that varying atmospheric conditions can lead to large discrepancies for single-event cases. This paper studies these atmospheric effects for a longer period, thus involving multi-event calculations. A European Civil Aviation Conference Document 29 compliant noise model is used with the extended functionality to apply results from a ray-tracing excess attenuation calculation. Results are shown for monthly and yearly noise contours around an example airport using three different modeling options: the standard Document 29 methodology, the standard methodology augmented by varying atmospheric absorption, and the ray-tracing excess attenuation method. The differences found in excess attenuation between the standard Document 29 method and ray tracing are small. It is argued that the main differences are related to varying atmospheric absorption and ground attenuation. For the case considered, wind effects are of minor importance when modeling monthly or yearly contours. In conclusion, the empirical lateral attenuation model, used to estimate the average excess attenuation in a varying atmosphere, provides a practical and realistic estimate for yearly and monthly noise contours for the used atmosphere.",51,5

No longer can the design problem be assimilated and steered by a single chief engineer. Rather, to find consensus, design involves a complex iterative process between the different specialist committees (weights, aerodynamics, structures, cost, etc.). Furthermore, there is a growing need to take into account the life-cycle implications of low-level design decisions in addition to their more direct implications on performance. The Decision Environment for Complex Designs project at the University of Southampton aims to explore how the design process may be streamlined under these circumstances. The case study presented here centers around a maritime surveillance unmanned aerial vehicle for search and rescue tasks, developed in association with the U.K. Coastguard. The focus is on “value-driven” design and how advances in software engineering, rationale capture, operational simulation, and rapid prototyping can be leveraged to create an integrated design suite that allows the rapid design and manufacture of low-cost civilian unmanned aerial vehicles.",51,5

By retaining the essential strongly nonlinear behaviors and the dominant system dynamics, a low-order model of the time-dependent behaviors of shock motion is developed to describe the bistability and hysteresis behaviors of shock motion in a supersonic inlet. Assumptions of inviscid and quasi-one-dimensional flow are invoked to ensure an analytic description of the dynamic process. Comparisons between the low-order model and unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulation results show the low-order model has the capability of qualitatively describing the bistability and hysteresis behaviors of shock motion.",51,5

This work presents experimental results of vortex-flow manipulation on a generic delta-wing configuration using pulsed blowing slot actuators along the leading edge. The frequencies of the examined blowing cases are chosen on the basis of unsteady characteristics that occur in the shear-layer roll-up during vortex formation and vortex breakdown. The results of hot-wire measurements substantiate the receptivity of the shear layer for the pulsed excitation until into the vortex core. The flowfield response to this periodic forcing is shown by the displacement of the vortex bursting location in a chordwise direction, thus satisfying the aim of enhancing the aerodynamic performance.",51,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032234,"An experimental study was conducted to investigate the aeroacoustics of open- and closed-cavity configurations with and without flow control using microjets at low speeds. The cavity models had length-to-depth ratios of 2, 10, and 18, representing open, transitional, and closed cavities, respectively. The investigation was carried out at a flow speed of 16 meters per second. The microjet effectiveness was tested for jet velocities of 8, 16 and 24 meters per second. The vortex shedding aft of the trailing edge was reduced when the microjet velocity was equal to that of the freestream (16 meters per second). The results from the transitional cavity experiment, with a length-to-depth ratio of 10, showed that either higher microjet velocities or different locations of the microjets may be required to have any significant effect on the cavity flow characteristics.",51,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032283,"Based on a hierarchical overset-grid strategy, enhanced implicit-hole-cutting method has been applied to the study of viscous flows around 30P30N multi-element airfoil and the wing–body configuration of the NASA common research model. Numerical simulations were performed on overlapping grids by an in-house computational fluid dynamics solver called Exstream. The present paper conducted the grid-convergence and buffet study of the NASA common research model, which was used in the Fifth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop. The result of the 30P30N multi-element airfoil proves that the enhanced implicit-hole-cutting method and Exstream solver could obtain great robustness and accurateness. From the result of the grid-convergence study, the value of total drag follows a nearly linear trend and seems to converge to a given value under different grid refinements. Moreover, grid density has a nonnegligible impact on the skin-friction drag component. The consequence of buffet study reveals that there is a very interesting variation of lift coefficient that it decreases from 0.599 to 0.587 when the angle of attack increases from 3.00 to 3.25 deg. The streamlines and surface-pressure contours show that a flow separation bubble appears near the trailing edge of the wing–fuselage junction. Extrafine overlapping grid, matched structured grid, and different turbulence models have been tested for the flow separation bubble.",51,5

Lagrange equations are used for flexible degrees of freedom, discretized by means of the Galërkin method. The evolution of transport degrees of freedom (position and attitude variables) is obtained by means of Newton’s second law and a generalized Euler equation. A strong link with conventional rigid aircraft equations of motion is maintained, which allows to highlight those terms less relevant for aircraft response. When negligible, these terms are removed, and a minimum-complexity flexible aircraft model is derived, suitable for real-time simulation and control law synthesis. Numerical results demonstrate how the approach correctly represents flexibility effects on aircraft response for a large transport aircraft model.",51,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032299,"Previous studies have shown that chord extension morphing over a spanwise section of helicopter rotor blades can reduce main rotor power requirements in stall-dominant flight conditions while being able to increase the maximum gross weight, altitude, and flight speed capability of the aircraft. This study examines a centrifugally driven, fully passive chord morphing mechanism for helicopter rotor blades. It is based on a von Mises truss connected to a rigid extension plate that deploys through a slit in the trailing edge. When the rotor revolutions per minute increases beyond a critical value, the chordwise component of centrifugal force on the assembly results in the deployment of the plate beyond the slit in the trailing edge, effectively increasing chord length. On reducing the revolutions per minute, a retraction spring pulls the plate back within the confines of the blade. This study presents the design process, iterations, and final design solution for a configuration that undergoes 20% chord extension. A prototype was fabricated and tested on the bench top as well as on a rotor test stand at rotational speeds simulating more than 60% full-scale centrifugal loads. The test results demonstrate that the concept works. However, effects such as friction lead to revolutions-per-minute requirements different from those predicted by simulation.",51,5

The proposed methodology is an extension of the NOISHHH tool originally developed for the optimization of single-event trajectories. The new optimization framework has been developed to synthesize multi-event area navigation trajectories that minimize the community noise impact in near-airport communities due to the aggregated noise impact on near-airport communities of all inbound and outbound flights on a representative day. The methodology has been applied to nightly inbound flights at a large international airport, revealing a significant improvement of the community noise impact in terms of the number of people highly annoyed due to aircraft noise.",51,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032313,"Superposition of spanwise lift distributions is a familiar concept from lifting-line theory. However, even for linear potential flows, superposition is not rigorously applicable for aerodynamic models and wing geometries in which the shape of the wake vortex system changes with angle of attack. Nonetheless, the influence of these wake effects could generally be expected to be small, insofar as downstream vortices have a weaker influence than the vortex system in the near field of the wing. In this paper, the theoretical framework for lift distribution superposition is first examined. Next, empirical studies conducted with a panel code are presented that show that superposition remains a very good approximation for a wide range of wing geometries and operating conditions. A method for correcting the small errors in induced drag predictions that result from the application of superposition is also provided. Finally, an application for wing design in which an additional and a design distribution are superimposed to produce lift distributions at other operating conditions is presented. This formulation reveals insights into the influence of the design distribution and the planform characteristics, and it supports computationally inexpensive optimization of wing twist.",51,5

The aeroelastic response modes of the wing with a nonlinear energy sink coupled to the tip are identified and tested for robustness using a medium-fidelity computational aeroelasticity model, and confirm that robust suppression of transonic aeroelastic instabilities is achievable. Accordingly, a nonlinear energy sink is designed based on a parametric study, and its transonic aeroelastic effects are studied using medium- and high-fidelity models. The results of both models indicate an improvement in stability over a broad range of conditions; the high-fidelity model predicts an approximately 40% increase in the dynamic pressure at the critical stability condition. Finally, a prototype winglet-mounted nonlinear energy sink is modeled to examine its aeroelastic effects. The results show that the nonlinear-energy-sink design is robust, but the winglet design plays a critical role that must be considered in the overall effect.",51,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032359,"Many efforts to mitigate the environmental impact of aviation, like NASA’s Subsonic Fixed Wing Project, place high importance on reducing fuel burn, nitrogen oxide emissions, and noise of future aircraft. However, the environmental and economic impact of a new aircraft is not solely a function of the aircraft’s performance but also of how airlines use new aircraft along with other existing aircraft to satisfy the passenger demand for air transportation. In this work, an optimization problem finds the optimal allocation of existing and future aircraft to routes representing commercial air transportation within or to/from the United States to measure various fleet-level metrics. Examining fleet-level environmental metrics helps assess how aircraft meeting NASA’s Subsonic Fixed Wing Project goals could impact fleet-level environmental goals established by the International Air Transport Association. The goal set forth by the International Air Transport Association examined in this paper is to reduce total aviation emission levels to 50% of 2005 levels in 2050. The International Air Transport Association recognizes multiple approaches to reduce emissions, referred to as the “four-pillar strategy for reducing emissions.” Of these approaches, this paper looks specifically at how improvements in aircraft concepts and technology will impact systemwide environmental impacts. Results indicate that goals set forth by the International Air Transport Association for 2050 emissions appear attainable, with an aircraft allocation to minimize fuel burn and future aircraft that meet the NASA and Subsonic Fixed Wing Project fuel-consumption goals.",51,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032366,"This study investigates the impact of meteorological parameters (crosswind, headwind, wind shear, thermal stratification, turbulent kinetic energy, dissipation rate, and density) and aircraft parameters (position, heading, speed, weight, span, and spanwise load factor) on wake-vortex behavior. Typical measurement uncertainties of these parameters, on one hand, and the range in which they typically reside, on the other hand, are mapped on variations of lateral and vertical position and lifetime of the wake vortices. For this mapping process, the deterministic two-phase wake-vortex model is employed, complemented by some simple considerations, dimensional analysis, and sources from literature. Three scenarios comprising cruise conditions, flight within the atmospheric boundary layer, and ground proximity are considered. From these investigations, the following ranking of the impact parameters has been deduced: wind, thermal stratification, turbulence, position, mass, and spanwise load factor. The relevance of the remaining parameters appears small.",51,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032385,"Aircraft flown in formation can realize significant reductions in drag by flying in regions of wake upwash. However, most transports fly at transonic speeds where the impact of compressibility on formation flight is not well understood. This study uses an Euler solver to analyze the inviscid aerodynamic forces and moments of transonic wing/body configurations flying in a two-aircraft formation. Formations with large streamwise separation distances (10–50 wingspans) are considered. This work indicates that compressibility-related drag penalties in formation flight may be eliminated by slowing 2–3% below the nominal out-of-formation cruise Mach number, either at fixed lift coefficient or fixed altitude. The latter option has the additional benefit that the aerodynamic performance of the formation improves slightly at higher lift coefficients. Although optimal in-formation lift coefficients are not as high as those estimated by incompressible analyses, modest increases in altitude can yield further improvements in aerodynamic efficiency. Increasing the lateral separation of the aircraft allows for slightly higher cruise speeds in exchange for higher induced drag. For the configurations examined here, a 1–2% reduction in Mach number combined with a lateral spacing increase of 5% span (vertical spacing aligned with the vortex) achieves a total formation drag savings of about 10%.",51,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032388,"The presented investigation focuses on the determination of unsteady aerodynamic loads for different kinds of wake vortex encounters. The wake-generating aircraft is a delta–canard configuration, whereas for the penetration, just a delta wing is considered. Based on extensive experimental and numerical investigations of the wake vortex system of a preceding aircraft, the wake-induced angle of attack on an encountering aircraft is determined. Therefore, the induced flowfield of the wake-generating aircraft is transformed into the coordinate system of the penetrating aircraft. Because the unsteadiness results on the one hand from the velocity fluctuations inside the wake, and on the other hand from the relative movement of the two aircraft, the wake problem is split into a discrete and a continuous wake problem. Both problems lead to an unsteady distribution of the angle of attack, which is variable in the chord and spanwise directions. The resulting lift and pitching moment distribution is calculated by an alternative approach to the unsteady lifting surface method. For the discrete wake problem, the resulting loads depend on the heading and bank angle of the penetrating aircraft relative to the vortex axes. In general, negative lift, rolling, and pitching moments can be observed. Their magnitude varies with the encounter maneuver. The continuous wake problem refers to the unsteady loads due to velocity fluctuations inside the wake on an aircraft following the wake-generating aircraft. Thereby, high-frequency forces and moments act upon the following aircraft.",51,5

18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032402,"Maneuver load alleviation, gust load alleviation, and natural laminar flow are integrated into aircraft conceptual design. The concurrent design of the aircraft and its active load alleviation systems can yield significant gains. The simultaneous application of maneuver load alleviation and gust load alleviation to a short-haul aircraft leads to an 11% reduction in fuel burn and 7% reduction in direct operating cost. These savings are diminished if maneuver load alleviation and gust load alleviation are applied independently. The synergy between active load control and natural laminar flow is also explored. It is possible to invest some of the weight savings from load alleviation to achieve extensive laminar flow. The combination of load alleviation and natural laminar flow increases the fuel and cost savings to upwards of 18 and 11%, respectively. It is concluded that load alleviation can shift the transonic transport optimum toward low-sweep, natural laminar flow wings. Sensitivity studies finally demonstrate that contemporary commercial aircraft should be able to meet the control requirements for effective gust load alleviation.",51,5

Reliable systems require both agility and tolerance to gusts. This research develops a method to quantify the maneuverability and gust tolerance of bare airframes, independent of stabilizing controllers, using reachability and disturbance sensitivity sets. The method is applied to a stable flybar helicopter and an unstable flybarless helicopter, for which the state-space models were formed through system identification. It is shown that the flybar restricts the bare airframe’s ability to maneuver in translational velocity directions. As such, the flybarless helicopter proved more maneuverable and gust tolerant than the flybar helicopter. This approach was specifically applied here to compare stable and unstable helicopter platforms; however, the framework may be used to assess a broad range of aerial microsystems.",51,5

The results have applications in the design and control of small-scale aircraft for robustness with respect to turbulence. Using linearized equations of motion and the Dryden model of gusts, the paper presents analytical and numerical scaling laws for the phugoid natural frequency and damping ratio, and the variances of the airspeed and flight-path angle. The results show that small aircraft are more susceptible to high frequency gusts, that the phugoid damping ratio does not depend directly on airplane size, that the airspeed and flight-path angle variances can be parameterized by the ratio of the phugoid natural frequency to a characteristic turbulence frequency, and that the coefficient of variation of the airspeed decreases with increasing airplane size.

The main objectives are to increase the stall angle of attack and reduce the power required by the high-lift system. A two-dimensional sensitivity analysis explores the effects of varying airfoil camber and thickness in the first 20% of the chord. The resulting droop nose configuration improves the maximum lift coefficient by about 20% and increases the stall angle of attack by around 10–15 deg. A target lift coefficient of about 4.7 is reached with 28% less jet momentum coefficient, compared to the clean nose. As the modified leading-edge geometry presents different stall mechanisms, the aerodynamic response to variations of jet momentum is also different. In particular, for a jet momentum coefficient above 0.035, the stall angle of attack increases with jet momentum, in contrast with the behavior observed with the clean nose.",51,5

However, the design of the blended wing is challenging due to the tight coupling between aerodynamic performance, trim, and stability. Other design challenges include the nature and number of the design variables involved, and the transonic flow conditions. To address these issues, a series of aerodynamic shape optimization studies using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics with a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model is performed. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with a discrete adjoint method that computes the derivatives of the aerodynamic forces. A total of 273 design variables—twist, airfoil shape, sweep, chord, and span—are considered. The drag coefficient at the cruise condition is minimized subject to lift, trim, static margin, and center plane bending moment constraints. The studies investigate the impact of the various constraints and design variables on optimized blended-wing-body configurations. The lowest drag among the trimmed and stable configurations is obtained by enforcing a 1% static margin constraint, resulting in a nearly elliptical spanwise lift distribution. Trim and static stability are investigated at both on- and off-design flight conditions.
