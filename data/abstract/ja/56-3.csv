1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034866,"A summary is provided for the Second AIAA Sonic Boom Workshop held on January 8–9, 2017, in conjunction with AIAA SciTech 2017. The workshop used four models of increasing complexity: an axisymmetric body, a wing-body, and a wing-body with tail configuration with either flow-through nacelles or propulsion boundary conditions. The last configuration was optional. The models were designed with similar nearfield signatures to isolate geometry and shock/expansion interaction effects. These cases are more relevant to vehicles with lower ground loudness and have the potential for lower annoyance than those in previous workshops. Eleven international participant groups submitted nearfield signatures. In addition, noise levels were computed by propagating the nearfield signatures to the ground. This allowed the evaluation of grid convergence and statistical distribution with respect to the noise metric. Prediction dramatically improved for the wing-body with tail and flow-through nacelle case between the first and second workshops. The models for the second workshop with quieter ground noise levels than those in the first workshop exposed weaknesses in analysis, particularly in convective discretization. While progress is documented since the first workshop, improvement to the analysis methods for a possible subsequent workshop is also provided.",56,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034805,"A summary is provided for the propagation portion of the second AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop, held 8 January 2017 in conjunction with the AIAA SciTech 2017 Conference. Near-field pressure waveforms for two cases were supplied, and ground signatures at multiple azimuthal angles as well as their corresponding loudness metrics were requested from 10 participants, representing three countries. Each case had some required as well as some optional runs. The required cases included atmospheric profiles with measured data including winds, using radiosonde balloon data at multiple geographically spread locations. The humidity profiles provided for the optional cases were taken from American National Standards Institute guidance. Participants provided ground signatures along with the requested data, including some loudness metrics using their best practices, which included lossy as well as lossless atmospheric propagation schemes. All the participants’ submissions, for each case, are compared and discussed. Noise or loudness measures are calculated, and detailed comparisons and statistical analyses are performed and presented. It has been observed that the variation in the loudness measures and spread between participants’ submissions increased as the computation proceeded from undertrack locations toward the lateral cutoff. Lessons learned during this workshop are discussed, and recommendations are made for potential improvements and possible subsequent workshops.",56,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034842,"Simulation results are presented for all test cases prescribed in the Second AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop. An inviscid, embedded-boundary Cartesian-mesh flow solver is used to compute “boom carpets”—pressure signatures at a range of specified distances and off-track angles. To accelerate the process, each boom carpet is automatically decomposed into several independent meshes, computed in parallel. Each mesh uses output-based mesh adaptation to affordably obtain credible results. This paper discusses improved Cartesian meshing strategies for boom prediction, including Mach alignment, azimuthal alignment, high-aspect-ratio cells, and adaptation functional weighting. The resulting nearfield signatures generally exhibit good convergence with mesh refinement. For an independent evaluation of our results, this study introduces a local error estimation procedure that highlights regions of the signatures most sensitive to mesh refinement. Results are also presented for the two atmospheric propagation test cases, which investigate the effects of atmospheric profiles on ground noise. Propagation is handled with an augmented Burgers’ equation method (NASA’s sBOOM), and ground noise metrics are compared.",56,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034819,"The accurate prediction of the sonic boom is essential for the development of a future low-boom supersonic aircraft. In this paper, geometries and grids provided by the Second AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop are used to improve a best practice for predicting near-field pressure signatures with the DLR TAU code. The workshop-provided low-boom geometries with different complexities, such as an axisymmetric body, a delta-wing body, and a full aircraft configuration with a cruciform tail and an engine. Results for the DLR TAU simulations on the workshop-provided grids are presented for different grid refinement levels using both Euler and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. In addition to the provided grids, mixed-element grids with varying setups are generated. The positions of the shocks and expansions are essentially identical for all medium to fine grids but vary for very coarse grids due to the surface triangulation. The pressure magnitude at shocks and expansions is higher for simulations on fine grids compared to coarse grids. It is shown that the influence of the viscosity on the pressure signatures is more significant than the influence of the grid resolution. The agreement between TAU solutions and other participants’ solutions is good.",56,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034831,"The NASA Tetrahedral Unstructured Software System with the USM3D flow solver was used to compute the test cases for the Second AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop (SBPW2). The intent of this paper is to document the USM3D results for SBPW2 test cases. The test cases included an axisymmetric equivalent area body, a Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency wing–body, and a NASA low-boom supersonic configuration modeled with flow-through nacelles and engine boundary conditions. All simulations were conducted for a freestream Mach number of 1.6, 0 deg angle of attack, and a Reynolds number of 5.7 million per meter. Simulations were conducted on the tetrahedral grids provided by the workshop committee as well as a family of grids generated by an in-house approach for sonic-boom analyses known as BoomGrid using current best practices. The near-field pressure signatures were extracted and propagated to the ground with the atmospheric propagation code sBOOM. The USM3D near-field pressure signatures, corresponding sBOOM ground signatures, and loudness levels on the ground are compared with mean values from other workshop participants.",56,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034840,"The recent release of the second AIAA sonic boom geometry offers the opportunity to review the classical anisotropic adaptive strategies for complex geometries. The design of Mach-aligned tailored grids is also a great challenge to see how adaptivity can compete with user-defined tailored grids. Two classical adaptive strategies, multiscale and goal-oriented, are compared with the results obtained on tailored grids. For the flow solver, several low-dissipation numerical schemes of order 4 and 6 are discussed with respect to regular second-order scheme both on inviscid and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow models. Finally, a nonlinear error analysis is performed to assess the convergence of the sequence of adaptive meshes with respect to tailored grids. All results and discussions are based on the C25D baseline geometry provided for the Second AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop.",56,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034841,"The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) prediction workshops sponsored by the AIAA have created invaluable opportunities to discuss the predictive capabilities of CFD in areas in which it has struggled, for example, sonic boom prediction. While there are many factors that contribute to disagreement between simulated and experimental results, such as modeling or discretization errors, quantifying the errors contained in a simulation is important for those who make decisions based on the computational results. The linearized error transport equations (ETE) combined with a truncation error estimate is a method to quantify one source of error. The ETE are implemented with a complex-step method to provide an exact linearization with minimal source code modifications to CFD and multidisciplinary analysis methods including atmospheric propagation of sonic boom signatures. Uniformly refined grids from the 2nd AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop demonstrate the utility of the linearized ETE for multidisciplinary analysis, capturing the general trends of the discretization error when flow features are resolved while also demonstrating issues related to error prediction near strong shocks or when under-resolved flow features are present.",56,3

9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034961,"The final approach and touchdown of a landing aircraft is studied numerically with different hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)/large-eddy simulations (LES) approaches. Particular emphasis is put on the ground effect and the wake vortex evolution before and after touchdown. Additionally, the effect of the landing gear on the aircraft’s aerodynamics during landing is analyzed. The near field around the landing aircraft is generated using two different RANS methods. In a number of steady-state simulations the altitude of the aircraft above ground was varied in fixed steps. Furthermore, a simplified continuous landing maneuver was simulated by applying unsteady RANS simulations. The resulting RANS fields are then coupled with an LES simulation using three different approaches. The computed vortex circulation is compared with aircraft measurements. As a result it can be seen that the new transient hybrid approach provides physically reasonable results. The landing gears have a notable effect on the aircraft’s drag, as well as on the wake footprint. However, the effect on the wake vortex circulation evolution is moderate. Remarkably, the simulations with landing gear show a strong coherent vortex, merging late with the main vortex. A particular emphasis is put on the comparison with light detection and ranging (LIDAR) measurement data collected in a recent campaign at Vienna airport. The vortex structures predicted by the simulations are clearly visible in those measurements. Simulated tangential velocity profiles are compared with vortex model profiles. It is observed that standard vortex models fail to capture the complex vortex structures emerging during the landing process but can be improved including mirror vortices.",56,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035094,"This paper presents an aeroelastic tailoring procedure used to design wing structures to meet strength, buckling, and flutter requirements simultaneously. The optimization process is divided into a continuous optimization step using lamination parameters, and a discrete optimization step, which produces detailed blended stacking sequences satisfying complex design and manufacturing guidelines. The implementation of the continuous optimization step benefits from recent advances in lamination parameter constraints, allowing for close approximation of realistic directional stiffness requirements. In the final discrete optimization step, a novel and efficient parametrization scheme called the Slice and Swap Method is developed. The scheme provides a design space that is simple to implement, allows for an ample family of blended stacking sequences to be explored, and includes a number of design requirements satisfied by suitable encoding. The efficiency of the aeroelastic tailoring procedure is demonstrated via a sample application to a realistic industry-scale regional jet wing.",56,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035188,"The aircraft takeoff maneuver for onboard operations is the most critical aspect of maritime performance. In the last decades, several improvements have been made to reduce the number of accidents. One of them is the ski-jump ramp, a modern takeoff system that allows the maneuver to be performed more safely and using less runway distance. Thus, a new in-depth aerodynamic study of the ramp is required. A wind-tunnel test campaign was developed to study the disturbances caused by the ski-jump ramp over the flight deck and the influence on an aircraft carrier performance. Smoke visualizations over the ramp revealed a detached unsteady recirculation bubble at the ramp and a turbulent flow over the flight deck. Velocity measurements were carried out by means of particle image velocimetry. The influence of these disturbances was evaluated for the takeoff performance of the AV-8B Harrier II. The results proved the importance of taking into account these disturbance effects and provided a detailed characterization of the flow over the carrier deck, resulting in establishment of a useful background for future studies on aircraft–ship interference.",56,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034845,"The propeller is a fundamental part of an aircraft powered by the turboprops, piston engines, or electric motors. A propeller that spins efficiently through air directly results in environmentally friendly and cost-effective flights. As a part of this novel study, the effect of leading-edge tubercle amplitude and wavelength on propeller efficiency was explored. The effect of leading-edge tubercles on various propeller solidities was also investigated. In addition, the effect of leading-edge tubercles on propeller diameter-to-pitch ratio was also studied for a wide range of advance ratios and rotational velocities. Small-sized aeronautic propellers were considered for the present study. The results predict an increase in efficiency of the modified propellers in comparison with the baseline propellers for all the cases considered in the present study. Therefore, a propeller-driven aircraft with the modified propeller installed in place of the baseline propeller, with an increased thrust-to-torque ratio, will have the potential for a higher maximum rate of climb, lower time to climb, higher absolute and service ceilings, and higher range and endurance, leading to greener and cost-effective flights.",56,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034995,"The high-incidence aerodynamics of a lightweight jet trainer aircraft model has been investigated using a novel five-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic maneuver rig, recently updated with improved actuation and data acquisition systems, in the closed-section low-speed wind tunnel at the University of Bristol. The major focus was to identify the nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic characteristics specific to the stall region and which affect free-to-move aircraft-model behavior. First, the unstable equilibrium states in the limit-cycle regions were stabilized, and so observed, over a wide range of angles of attack using a simple elevator feedback control law based on pitch angle and pitch-rate sensor measurements. Tests with two DOF, namely, the aircraft model and rig-arm pitch angles, revealed the existence of static hysteresis in the normal force acting on the aircraft model in the stall region. Unlocking the aircraft model in roll and yaw accompanied by feedback stabilization of the lateral–directional modes of motion demonstrated the onset of asymmetric aerodynamic rolling and yawing moments in this four-DOF configuration. This observation implicitly indicates a link between the static hystereses in the normal aerodynamic force with an onset of aerodynamic asymmetry. The experimental results show the efficiency of the updated multi-DOF actively controlled maneuver rig in providing insight into complicated aerodynamic effects within the stall region.",56,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035149,"The current Spalart–Allmaras (SA) laminar–turbulent transition model is evaluated through the representative two- and three-dimensional test cases within the line-based Hamiltonian–Strand grid flow solver. To consider crossflow instability on transition onset, the baseline SA model has been extended by incorporating the existing crossflow model, which was originally developed to be coupled with the model. For the extension, a simple modification is only required on the baseline transition model, and the extended model has been used with both structured and unstructured/strand grid types using the present flow solver. The extended transition model is applied on the representative test cases where crossflow is dominant, such as the NLF(2)-0415 wing, ONERA M6 swept wing, inclined prolate spheroid, and a challenging sickle wing. By comparing the results with the baseline SA model, predictive results are observed through the validation of test cases. The limitations of the extended model are also found through the sickle-wing test.",56,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035160,"This paper describes system identification of a nonlinear flight dynamic model for a small, low-cost, fixed-wing unmanned aircraft with a limited instrumentation system. Unique challenges include greater sensitivity to atmospheric disturbances and degraded data quality. Methods are presented to improve the fidelity of the identified model, including use of the vortex lattice method to supplement flight-test data and the synthesis of data from distinct flight-test maneuvers. The parameter estimation strategy is based on the time-domain formulation of the output-error method using the nonlinear flight dynamic equations for a rigid aircraft with a nonlinear aerodynamic model. Methods are presented that increase the accuracy of parameter estimates compared with standard procedures based solely on flight-test data. The paper describes a detailed application of these procedures to a particular small, fixed-wing aircraft so that they can readily be adapted to other aircraft at a similar scale.",56,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035069,"With the advances being made in additive manufacturing, it is becoming increasingly possible to fabricate a broad class of complex-shaped designs for practical applications. This manufacturing capability has allowed structural designers to implement the use of bio-inspired curvilinear stiffeners for achieving better designs of stiffened plate and shell structures. Curvilinear stiffeners have proven to be useful over straight stiffeners in some applications for achieving better structural efficiency. A framework has been developed that employs a hybrid optimization technique of using particle swarm optimization for stiffener shape optimization and gradient-based optimization as implemented in MSC.NASTRAN SOL 200 for optimization of stiffener cross section and shell thickness. Parallel processing has been used to save extensive wall-clock time. The framework has been employed for optimally designing cylindrical shells/panels stiffened by arbitrarily placed stiffeners, the motivation being lighter-weight fuselage and space launch vehicle designs. Structural optimization results have been presented for the optimal design of stiffened shells with the objective of weight minimization for shells subjected to both buckling and stress constraints. Optimization studies show that both the stiffener placement and the stiffener geometric curvature influence the shell buckling load, which can help to decrease the structural weight by optimizing the cross-sectional dimensions for stiffeners and panel thickness. In this paper, cylindrical shells, stiffened by four stiffeners, placed arbitrarily, are studied under compression and shear load cases. It is seen that arbitrarily placed curvilinear stiffeners lead to a potential 13% weight saving as compared to the use of equally spaced straight stiffeners when designed for the compression load case.",56,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035131,"This paper is based on results presented at the Third High Lift Prediction Workshop. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency provided computer-aided design models and experimental results of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Standard Model to the workshop as a test case. An unstructured hybrid mesh generator, MEGG3D, was applied to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Standard Model wing-body and wing-body-nacelle-pylon configurations to generate grids, which were provided for the use of workshop participants by the committee. This paper presents details of experimental results and the method for deforming the computer-aided design models and volume grids based on the experiment. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., performed computational fluid dynamics simulations of the test case as workshop participants. Kawasaki Heavy Industries also generated custom participant-generated grids. Their computational results using the TAS code and Cflow are discussed.",56,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035039,"The objective of this paper is to investigate the impact of two commonly used turbulence models with three different shape parameterization techniques in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations on two-dimensional optimum design obtained with gradient-based deterministic and robust aerodynamic shape optimization in transonic, viscous, turbulent flow. The main contribution of this study to aerodynamic design area is to evaluate the impact of turbulence models and shape parameterization techniques on the computational cost, optimal shape, and its performance obtained with robust optimization under uncertainty. The two turbulence models investigated include Spalart–Allmaras and Menter’s shear-stress transport models. Hicks–Henne bump functions, B-spline curves, and free-form deformation are used as shape parameterization techniques. The results of the current study show that the shape parameterization technique has a larger impact on the computational cost compared to the turbulence model in both deterministic and robust design. Robust design tends to reduce the impact of the turbulence model selection on the optimum shape and performance, whereas the turbulence model becomes important for the deterministic design at off-design conditions. In this study, the robustness of the final design obtained with stochastic optimization approach is also demonstrated over the Mach number range considered as the uncertain operating condition.",56,3
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035170,"By modeling compatibilities, benefits, and penalties of various technology packages at the subsystem level in a vehicle design tool, bottom-up assessments of projected technological benefits can be conducted. Fleet-level exploratory forecasting requires linking these vehicle level benefits to forecasts of operations in the National Airspace System. By synthesizing a system-wide/fleet-level environmental performance model and a rapid fleet-level noise computation model, the tradeoffs between fuel burn, emissions, and noise can be compared for a variety of technology infusion scenarios and various retirement/replacement strategies. These synthesized models serve as a screening-level tool to identify promising scenarios for technology investments. The best scenarios can then be modeled in higher-fidelity tools to verify the potential gains from the technology investment. A few examples of the screening-level capabilities for fleet-level scenario analysis are demonstrated.",56,3
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035141,"This paper presents a system identification procedure for a class of small, rudderless, fixed-wing unmanned aircraft. The procedure is demonstrated on an aircraft that is equipped with only two aerodynamic control surfaces (called elevons) and one electric motor. A physics-based, first-principles approach is used to obtain the initial model parameters. The initial model is used to design flight tests wherein the longitudinal and the lateral-directional dynamics are separately excited. The aircraft is rudderless and this introduces a key challenge in the model identification. Specifically, the lateral-directional model has more free parameters than can be identified using the elevon excitations alone. This paper resorts to two novel steps to navigate this roadblock. First, this paper uses black-box methods to identify sensitive modes whose damping ratios and natural frequencies change significantly compared with their initial values. Second, gray-box methods are used to update the stability and control derivatives related to these sensitive modes, while retaining the remaining derivatives at their respective initial values. Additional flight tests are conducted to validate the updated model parameters.",56,3
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035201,"Cooperative transportation of payloads by multiple unmanned air vehicles has received increasing interest due to unique operational advantages. These include the portability of the individual vehicles and the scalability of the lifting strategy in the presence of differing payloads. By rigidly attaching a set of unmanned air vehicles to a payload, the control effort required to transport the payload is divided across the vehicles. In the presence of uncertainty about a payload’s mass and inertial characteristics, there is no inherent flightworthiness guarantee for a specific connected unmanned air vehicle configuration. This Paper describes a method for determining on-ground flightworthiness of the unmanned air vehicle-payload system while making minimal assumptions about inertial properties of the payload or the attachment configuration of the unmanned air vehicles. The probabilistic model itself is initialized and updated (built) by the algorithm. Within the model, the vehicles are positioned. Building upon prior theoretical developments, this Paper explores the differing sources of error in the estimates and experimentally validates the algorithm through a series of tests using prototype modular vehicles. Overall, simulation and test results highlight the dominant performance factors and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach for a range of payload geometries.",56,3

The paper addresses a number of long-standing challenges of automatic control of hypersonic vehicles that exhibit numerous aerodynamic and structural uncertainties over a wide Mach-altitude flight envelope. A full-state feedback stabilizing controller that is augmented by an adaptive controller is implemented to control the vehicle. Furthermore, the controllers are able to bring the vehicle to the right initial conditions at an altitude of 26 km to start a scramjet, which are at a speed of Mach 6.",56,3
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035082,"Traditionally, computational design optimization of commercial aircraft is performed by considering a small number of representative operating conditions. These conditions are based on the design Mach number, altitude, payload, and range for which the aircraft will be flown. However, the design also influences which routes and mission parameters are optimal, and so there is coupling that is ignored when using the traditional approach. Here, the aircraft design, mission profiles, and the allocation of aircraft to routes in an airline network are simultaneously optimized. This is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem that is reformulated as a nonlinear programming problem because of the large number of design variables. The reformulated problem is solved using a gradient-based optimization approach with a parallel computational framework that facilitates the multidisciplinary analysis and the derivative computation. A surrogate model is used for the computational fluid dynamics analysis that is retrained in each optimization iteration given the new set of shape design variables. The resulting optimization problem contains over 4,000 design variables and close to 14,000 constraints. The optimization results show a 2% increase in airline profit compared with the traditional multipoint optimization approach. The wing area increases to the upper bound, enabling a higher cruise altitude that improves propulsive efficiency. This study finds that simultaneously optimizing the allocation, mission, and design to maximize airline profit results in a different optimized wing design from that resulting from the multipoint optimization approach.",56,3
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034776,"This paper provides a fundamental understanding of the unsteady aerodynamic phenomena on a cycloidal rotor blade operating with symmetric as well as asymmetric pitching at ultralow Reynolds numbers by using a combination of experimental (force and flowfield measurements) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies. The instantaneous blade fluid dynamic forces on a rotating cycloidal rotor blade were measured, which, along with particle image velocimetry (PIV) based flowfield measurements revealed the key fluid dynamic mechanisms acting on the blade. A two-dimensional CFD analysis of the cycloidal rotor was developed and systematically validated using both force and flowfield measurements. The CFD flow solution and PIV-measured flowfield correlated well, especially in the upper half of the circular blade trajectory, and both showed the formation and shedding of strong dynamic stall or leading-edge vortices at high pitch amplitudes, which is the reason for the stall delay and force enhancement. The dynamic virtual camber induced by the flow curvature decreased the blade lift in the upper half due to negative induced camber; however, the lift increased in the lower half due to positive camber. Therefore, introducing an asymmetry in pitch kinematics with higher pitch in the upper half and lower pitch in the bottom half counteracted this inherent lift asymmetry and improved efficiency through a more uniform lift production.",56,3

A flight performance simulation was developed in a MATLAB/Simulink environment using publicly available aircraft data for the Boeing 737-700 commercial transport aircraft and the CFM56-7B26 turbofan engine. A parallel hybrid drivetrain was integrated into the aircraft performance model. Various missions with different degrees of hybridization and battery specific energy densities were simulated and compared to the conventional turbofan case. emissions associated with fuel burn and electricity generation for charging battery systems were modeled for each hybrid aircraft configuration. The results indicated that reductions in emissions per passenger mile were achievable using a parallel hybrid propulsion system as compared to conventional systems of equivalent range. A candidate propulsion system configuration was defined, which used a 50% electrical-power drivetrain and a battery specific energy density of . This configuration was estimated to produce 49.6% less lifecycle emissions than a modern conventional aircraft, with a maximum range equivalent to that of the average of all global flights, making it a viable option for environmentally responsible aviation.",56,3
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035250,"The impingement of a propeller slipstream on a downstream surface causes unsteady loading, which may lead to vibrations responsible for structure-borne noise. A low-speed wind-tunnel experiment was performed to quantify the potential of a flow-permeable leading edge to alleviate the slipstream-induced unsteady loading. For this purpose, a tractor propeller was installed at the tip of a pylon featuring a replaceable leading-edge insert in the region of slipstream impingement. Tests were carried out with four flow-permeable inserts, with different hole diameters and cavity depths, and a baseline solid insert. Particle-image-velocimetry measurements showed that the flow through the permeable surface caused an increase in boundary-layer thickness on the pylon’s suction side. This led to a local drag increase and reduced lift, especially for angles of attack above 6 deg. Furthermore, it amplified the viscous interaction with the propeller tip-vortex cores, reducing the velocity fluctuations near the pylon surface by up to 35%. Consequently, lower tonal noise emissions from the pylon were measured in the far field. This suggests that the desired reduction in surface pressure fluctuations was achieved by application of the flow-permeable leading edge.",56,3
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035204,"The study explores wing elasticity effects on the store-separation process. The nominal test case is that of an unmanned aerial vehicle that carries two identical stores on two wing stations. The stores are ejected during straight and level flight at , 2500 m. Simultaneous, time-accurate analysis of the dynamic aeroelastic wing response and the store’s trajectory reveals that the most significant aeroelastic effect is a roll motion developed by the store. This roll motion is due to misalignment of the ejection force vector and the store’s center of gravity, due to the wing’s static and dynamic elastic deformations. The second part of the paper presents a parametric study of the effects of various structural and configurational parameters on the wing’s response and consequently on the store’s rolling motion. A more flexible wing, a heavier store, a larger ejection force, or a shorter ejection period all result in increased store rolling. Store ejection from an asymmetric configuration (of a single store) yielded a very similar store roll compared to the symmetric ejection. The dynamic wing response plays a major role in generating the store roll, in different conditions of friction between the store body and ejection piston. A practical observation is that the store roll is dependent on the relation between the ejection period and the low structural frequencies of the wing. This can be used to plan an optimal ejection profile.",56,3

The applied aircraft separations are analyzed, depending on the involved aircraft types and compared to the International Civil Aviation Organization and recategorization separation standards. Furthermore, the distances between the wake generated by the leading aircraft and the follower are evaluated. The results reveal that, in at least 3.7% of the landings in which the measured vortices are generated in an altitude below 50 m, the luff vortex remains within a distance of 50 m to the follower within a temporal buffer of of flyby. In only three landings, the encounters exceed a roll-control ratio of 0.2: a limit beneath which encounters are considered acceptable by pilots.",56,3
