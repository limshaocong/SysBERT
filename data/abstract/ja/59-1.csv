1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036157,"Wind tunnel oscillatory testing is a technique conventionally used for the measurement of dynamic aerodynamic loads on subscale aircraft models. Oscillatory testing is commonly used for identification of dynamic stability derivatives for flight mechanics models. Model oscillation is normally driven by a rig drive mechanism, or with the use of its control surfaces. This paper presents a new test technique in which self-induced coupled roll and yaw oscillations are driven purely by the aircraft’s natural modes of motion when constrained in translation and in pitch rotation. This method does not require external mechanisms to drive the motion, nor the use of aircraft control surface inputs to sustain the oscillation. Without these sources of error, it is potentially advantageous for identification of dynamic stability derivatives using parameter estimation techniques. The mechanics of and requirements for this self-induced oscillation are discussed. Computational simulation and dynamic wind tunnel tests of a subscale BAe Hawk model are used to demonstrate the self-induced roll–yaw oscillations and their results are compared. Effects of varying parameters such as wind tunnel speed and the addition of spring stiffness onto the aircraft rotation axes on the frequency and stability of the oscillation are investigated.",59,1
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036372,"Future aircraft designs look set to use longer wingspans to increase the aspect ratio and therefore overall aerodynamic efficiency of the airframe. Such larger wingspans also reduce roll rates and require increased control surface area to achieve the roll maneuver requirements for certification. In this work, the effect of using flared folding wingtips (FFWTs) on the roll performance of simple aircraft wings is investigated numerically and experimentally. A unique rolling rig is designed, manufactured, and tested, with a series of steady roll and transient tests performed for different wingspans, with and without folding wingtips. It is shown that the use of FFWTs on aircraft wings can enable improved aerodynamic performance due to the increased span while also significantly reducing the aerodynamic damping due to roll, such that the roll performance of a wing incorporating FFWTs is comparable to that of one without the additional span.",59,1

Validation of the crossflow model implementation has been performed using standard test cases. The pressure-sensitive-paint rotor is simulated in hover for various collective pitch angles as a test case for the transition model. The OVERFLOW 2.2n solver is used with laminar–turbulent transition modeling and hybrid Reynolds–averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation turbulence modeling enabled. Grid generation, numerical methods, and transition modeling are described. The effects of crossflow transition are qualitatively and quantitatively assessed through comparisons to experiments, to a transition model without crossflow, and to a fully turbulent model. Additionally, several techniques for evaluating unsteady boundary-layer transition are described and are applied to solutions for the pressure-sensitive-paint rotor in hover.",59,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036383,"Aircraft-mounted gas turbine engines may need to employ a variety of inlet ducts to perform various missions. An inertial particle separator (IPS) is a type of inlet duct that can remove harmful dust and debris from an engine’s flow path. The IPS is a bifurcating duct that is designed to remove particles, but it may also cause undesired flow separation. A novel study on such a bifurcating duct at high Reynolds number is undertaken. This is the first study to perform unsteady, three-dimensional simulations of the flow inside an IPS. The improved delayed detached eddy simulation numerical method is applied to a time-resolved experimental S-duct case to ensure the approach is valid. Results showed highly unsteady, separated flow, consistent with experiments. The time-resolved, three-dimensional structure of flow inside an IPS is visualized for the first time.",59,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036298,"Compressible cavity flows exist widely in aeronautical vehicles. The cost of the computational fluid dynamics to solve compressible cavity flows is high. To address this issue, in this work, a novel reduced-order model (ROM) combining proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network named LSTM-ROM for predicting the compressible cavity flows is proposed. First, POD is used to provide a low-dimensional subspace. Then, the LSTM neural network is designed to predict the POD coefficients with time evolution. The results show that the LSTM-ROM can accurately predict the POD coefficients for a long time and capture the shock wave structures at supersonic speed. The predicted density and normal velocity field are consistent with those simulated by direct numerical simulation (DNS). The calculation time of LSTM-ROM is almost one-seventh of that of DNS. By comparing the performance of LSTM-ROM with that of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and multilayer perceptron (MLP), it is found that the root mean square errors of density and normal velocity field predicted by LSTM-ROM are smaller than those predicted by DMD and MLP. In addition, the LSTM-ROM can accurately and efficiently predict the flows over cavities with different inclination angles at subsonic speed. Therefore, the LSTM-ROM is an accurate and efficient method for predicting the compressible cavity flows, which lays a foundation for other complex flows.",59,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036217,"This paper analyzes the effects of the helicopter dynamics on pilots’ learning process and transfer of learned skills during autorotation training. A quasi-transfer-of-training experiment was performed with 14 experienced helicopter pilots in a moving-base flight simulator. Two types of helicopter dynamics, characterized by a different autorotative index, were considered: “hard,” with high pilot compensation required, and “easy,” with low compensation required. Two groups of pilots tested the two types of dynamics in a different training sequence: hard-easy-hard (HEH group) and easy-hard-easy (EHE group). Participants of both groups were able to attain adequate performance at touchdown in most of the landings with both types of dynamics. However, a clear positive transfer effect in terms of acquired skills is found in both groups from the hard to the easy dynamics, but not from the easy to the hard dynamics, confirming previous experimental evidence. Positive transfer is especially observed for the rate of descent at touchdown. The two groups differed in the control strategy applied, with the HEH group having developed a more robust control technique. During the last training phase the EHE group aligned its control strategy with that of the HEH group.",59,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036377,"To improve robustness and efficiency of automatic transition prediction in aerodynamic design, a reduced model of linear stability analysis is usually adopted, such as -envelope or -database method. Nevertheless, building such a model is challenging when it comes to compressible flows, as the transition mechanism is more complex and multiple flow parameters should be taken into consideration. To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient surrogate-based method for compressible boundary layers that uses pretrained surrogate models to substitute linear stability analysis, concerning stability analysis of both Tollmien–Schlichting and Mack modes, as well as transition prediction of flow over arbitrary-shaped airfoils. The proposed method is demonstrated by stability analysis of compressible flat-plate boundary layers at a wide range of Mach numbers of . It is also validated by transition prediction of flow over a low-speed natural-laminar-flow (NLF) airfoil NLF-0416 and a transonic NLF airfoil NPU-LSC-72613. Besides, a sample partitioning method is presented to accelerate surrogate-model training with large samples. Results show that the predicted growth rates of perturbations, factors, and corresponding transition locations by our method of using surrogate-based stability analysis agree well with those by a standard method of solving full linear stability equations.",59,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036374,"As contemporary aerostructural research for aircraft design trends toward high-fidelity computational methods, aerostructural solutions based on theory are often neglected or forgotten. In fact, in many modern aerostructural wing optimization studies, the elliptic lift distribution is used as a reference in place of theoretical aerostructural solutions with more appropriate constraints. In this paper, the authors review several theoretical aerostructural solutions that could be used as reference cases for wing design studies, and these are compared to high-fidelity solutions with similar constraints. Solutions are presented for studies with 1) constraints related to the wing integrated bending moment, 2) constraints related to the wing root bending moment, and 3) structural constraints combined with operational constraints related to either wing stall or wing loading. It is shown that, under appropriate design constraints, theoretical solutions for the optimum lift distribution may capture aerostructural coupling sufficiently to serve as appropriate reference cases for higher-fidelity solvers. A comparison of theoretical and high-fidelity solutions for the optimum wingspan and corresponding drag reveals important insights into the effects of certain aerodynamic and structural parameters and constraints on the aerodynamic and structural coupling involved in aerostructural wing design and optimization.",59,1

Change in store pitch was observed using a high-speed camera. Trajectories were grouped using machine learning with a -means clustering, followed by a Gaussian mixture model clustering approach. The -means clustering revealed two primary groups and one outlier group. The statistical strength of the primary groups was confirmed with the Gaussian mixture model, which places 89% of trajectories into one of two groups. The existence of two primary groups is strong evidence of a bifurcation.",59,1

There is no equivalent counterpart of the well-known radar cross section (RCS) that can be easily used for obtaining IR lock-on range, . This study introduces the concept of IR cross section of complete aircraft as seen by seeker in band in and of aircraft part in an orthogonal view. The IR solid angle subtended by of complete aircraft and of an aircraft part is also introduced, which is the basis for redefined general criterion for lock-on by IR-guided missile. Equality based on at aircraft part level and at complete aircraft level is the basis for obtaining of complete aircraft in terms of its .

11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036390,"This paper presents systematic modeling and simulation of the dynamics and control of a carrier helicopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a suspended net used for capturing target UAVs. The goal is to study the effect of key design parameters such as the weight of the net end rod, its length, and point of impact of the UAV on the swing angle of the underslung net. First, a net with an entangled target UAV is modeled as a planar double pendulum. Next, the coupled flight dynamic model of carrier UAV with underslung net with entangled target UAV is simulated and validated using the test data gathered for this purpose. From the simulations, it is identified that the length of the net and point of capture of the UAV on the net are critical parameters that govern the maximum swing angles of the double-pendulum system. Moving the point of impact of the target UAV by 10% of net length resulted in up to 23 and 43% reduction in swing angles of pendulums 1 and 2. The active swing suppression using proportional derivative (PD) controller is effective in attenuating the swing angles in the simulation for successful capture.",59,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035896,"Instantaneous force and structural deformation experiments were performed on a flexible, structurally characterized, low-aspect-ratio representative flapping wing. A six-component force balance was used to measure aerodynamic-force time history over a flap cycle. A VICON motion capture setup tracked the wing deformations while flapping. Measured aerodynamic forces and wing deformations were compared against coupled computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics (CFD/CSD) aeroelastic analysis results. The CFD solver is an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver. The CSD solver is a general-purpose multibody dynamics solver capable of modeling geometrically nonlinear beam and shell elements. The CFD/CSD results were able to capture the overall trend in aerodynamic forces and wing deformations. Although predicted and measured variations in lift were similar, the drag-force magnitudes tended to be underpredicted by the coupled aeroelastic solver. The coupled CFD/CSD solver was used to evaluate the influence of wing flexibility on wing performance. Results showed that, in particular instances, decreasing wing stiffness increased the time-averaged aerodynamic lift and lift-to-power ratio. Decreased wing stiffness led to reduced leading-edge vortex circulation strength. This suggests that the increased wing performance is mainly due to a redirection of the resultant force vector allowed by the increased wing compliance.",59,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036411,"The hypersonic vehicle model Michigan–AFRL Scramjet in Vehicle (MASIV) is used to optimize both the active and the passive thermal protection systems on a scramjet-powered generic X-43 waverider. The passive thermal protection system is the NASA ARMOR design; a silicon dioxide insulation layer is sandwiched between a radiation shield and the vehicle titanium skin. The active thermal protection system consists of a heat exchanger on the combustor wall; the coolant is the liquid hydrogen fuel. The portion of the fuel that is used for cooling (and not for propulsion) is recirculated back into the fuel tank, which causes the temperature of fuel in the tank to rise. Gradient-based optimization is performed to determine 1) the minimum insulation thickness distribution required and 2) the optimal coolant mass flow rate and its variation in time. Constraints are that surface temperatures cannot exceed the failure temperatures, and the volume of fuel in the fuel tank cannot exceed the tank volume. The hypersonic vehicle heat transfer model is adaptable and can handle new materials for thermal protection, as they are developed.",59,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036336,"In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient frequency-domain model that can be used to compute the required shaft power and vibratory loads for a trimmed helicopter rotor with flexible blades in forward flight. The aerodynamic forces and power are modeled using a vortex-lattice method. A finite element model based on the linearized form of the Hodges–Dowell rotating beam equations is used to model the vibrating blades. Guyan reduction and harmonic balance are used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. The model is validated against several previous computational and experimental models, with generally good agreement. For rotors that use higher harmonic control, the problem of minimizing the required power and/or vibratory loads is cast as a quadratic programming problem requiring a single linear matrix solve to find the optimum. We show that for moderate and high advance ratios, higher harmonic control can substantially reduce vertical hub forces, but only with an increase in required cruise power. For example, using four-per-revolution higher harmonic control, the vertical vibratory loads on the four-bladed HART II rotor can be decreased by about 30% for a 3.0% increase in induced power for at a forward flight advance ratio of 0.45.",59,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035944,"The channel wing is a lift-enhancement concept pioneered by Willard Ray Custer in the late 1940s in an effort to provide a fixed-wing aircraft with short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities. This paper experimentally investigates the possibility of using Custer channel wings for slow flight and STOL of small (under 35 kg) fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The Custer unmanned aircraft developed at the University of Southampton is introduced in this paper, including details of the installed channel wings and other systems necessary for slow-flight operation. Results from wind-tunnel tests are presented, showing a significant lift increase due to the channel wings in the range of airspeeds of interest. Flight tests are carried out to demonstrate the slow flight and STOL capabilities of the aircraft, showing superior stall characteristics and a two-thirds reduction of the runway length required when using the channel wings. Flight-test comparisons to a conventional wing–propeller configuration show superior slow-flight performance and 7–9% lower cruise speed of the channel-wing aircraft.",59,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036403,"Aircraft wings are commonly designed with nonplanar geometry, such as winglets, in order to improve aerodynamic efficiency. This work presents a method for generating nonplanar wing designs through gradient-based optimization, which is then used to investigate the performance characteristics of nonplanar wings. The nonplanar parameterization is defined to give a large design space that allows the formation of highly nonplanar features and permits large changes to the geometry. Aerodynamic characteristics are captured using an inviscid three-dimensional panel method with approximations for viscous drag. The methodology is demonstrated by optimizing reference wings from literature and comparing aerodynamic performance. Investigations are also performed on the impact on performance when wings are raised or drooped, and the differences in aerodynamic behavior between the two designs. Results suggest that the converged designs and their performance are highly dependent on how the geometry is restricted. If a large design space is provided, both raised and drooped wings are able to produce designs with similar performance when only inviscid analysis is considered. When accounting for viscous effects, results suggest that drooped wings are not beneficial for drag reduction.",59,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036085,"The push for more-electric aircraft (MEA) has motivated numerous studies to quantify and optimize the impact of subsystem electrification in early design phases. Past studies on multi-objective optimization of MEA show a clear benefit over conventional architectures when no constraints are placed on the number of subsystems electrified at once. In reality, aircraft manufacturers are more likely to progressively electrify subsystems over multiple aircraft generations. While step-by-step electrification may lead to suboptimal MEA architectures when compared with scenarios with no such imposition on the number of subsystems electrified, little or no literature was found to address the optimal paths toward such electrification changes. This study proposes a mathematically defensible method to analyze different directions of technology evolution focusing on aircraft subsystem electrification. It seeks to enable decision makers to understand the performance tradeoffs between different electrification paths under different scenarios, constraints, and uncertainties. Certain trends in Pareto-optimal MEA architectures and progressive subsystem electrification order (optimal paths) under uncertainty are discussed.",59,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036386,"This paper describes a novel inlet flow conditioning concept that significantly improves ducted fans’ performance and controllability. High angle-of-attack operation of ducted fans is very common in vertical-takeoff-and-landing systems. The new concept named double-ducted fan (DDF) uses a secondary shroud to control inlet lip-separation-related momentum deficit at the inlet of the fan rotor during edgewise flight. The DDF is helpful in a wide edgewise flight velocity range, and its corrective aerodynamic effect becomes more pronounced with increasing flight velocity. A conventional baseline duct operating at 90 deg angle of attack is compared to other novel double-ducted fan designs via three-dimensional, viscous, and turbulent flow computations. A custom actuator-disk model replaces the zonal computation of the complex and three-dimensional rotor flowfield in the rotating frame of reference. Both hover and edgewise flight conditions are considered around the ducted fan unit and inside the ducts. Significant improvements from several novel ducted fan designs are in the areas of vertical thrust enhancement, nose-up pitching moment reduction, and recovery of fan through-flow mass flow rate in a wide horizontal flight range. A variable DDF design, a partial DDF design, and a fan-in-wing implementation of the DDF are introduced.",59,1

Conceptual-level multidisciplinary design optimization is first performed to size the strut-braced-wing aircraft for a design mission similar to the Embraer E190-E2, with a design range of 3100 nmi at a maximum capacity of 104 passengers, and a maximum payload of 30,200 lb. For direct performance comparisons, a conventional tube-and-wing regional jet is also sized and optimized based on the same reference aircraft. Gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization is then performed on wing–body–tail models of each aircraft, with the objective of drag minimization at cruise over a 500 nmi nominal mission. Design variables include twist and section shape degrees of freedom, which are realized through a free-form and axial deformation geometry control system, whereas nonlinear constraints include constant lift, zero pitching moment, minimum wing volume, and minimum maximum thickness-to-chord ratios. Results indicate that the optimizer is capable of mitigating shock formation, boundary-layer separation, and other flow interference effects from each wing design, including those within the wing–strut junction of the strut-braced wing. With year 2020 technology levels, the strut-braced-wing regional jet offers a 12.9% improvement in cruise lift-to-drag ratio over an Embraer E190-E2-like conventional tube-and-wing aircraft, which translates to a 7.6% reduction in block fuel for the nominal mission.",59,1
