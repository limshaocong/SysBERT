The free-interface component mode synthesis method is used to establish the nonlinear governing equations by extending the connected relationships. Based on the modeling method, the conditioned reverse path method is used to identify frequency response functions of the nominal linear system without the influence of nonlinearities, and the parameters of nonlinearities are identified in the frequency domain. Nonlinear analysis and identification of a typical folding wing configuration with three free-play hinges are investigated. The nonlinear governing equation is established based on present methods, and the computational results are checked by finite-element programming. Based on coherence function, the effects of a nonlinear function are evaluated. The frequency response funtion of the nominal linear system and parameters of the nonlinear function are identified by the conditioned reverse path method within the noise signal. A ground vibration test of an all-movable fin is performed. The results show that the extending component mode synthesis method in the present work could be used to establish governing equations with structural nonlinearities. Based on the modeling method, the conditioned reverse path method can be used to identify the structural nonlinearities accurately.",52,2

Input to the system comes from two dynamic pressure transducers located at 15% chord on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil. Microtabs with a height of 1% chord are located at 95% chord on the lower surface and 90% chord on the upper surface, enabling rapid increase or decrease of the lift force through deployment of the tabs on the pressure or suction side of the airfoil, respectively. Tests have been conducted with variations of up to 23% in airspeed, and the control system is able to reduce the total deviation in the lift force by 60% compared to the performance of the airfoil without the control system. The experiment validates the effectiveness of closed-loop control of lift using a trailing-edge tab-based system for lifting surfaces such as wind-turbine rotor blades.",52,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032663,"Risk analysis is used to identify an unsafe condition in a fleet of transport-category airplanes and to evaluate whether a proposed course of corrective action will be effective in mitigating the risk. One key element of the risk assessment is the uncorrected fleet risk, which estimates the fatalities that may occur over the remaining life of the fleet if no corrective action is taken. The uncorrected fleet risk incorporates the number of airplanes that are expected to develop damage such as cracking, whether the damage is likely to be detected over the life of the airplane, the probability that the damage will lead to an unsafe outcome such as a crash, in-flight breakup, runway departure, or individual fatality, and the historic fatality rate of the unsafe outcome. This paper presents tools that have been developed to perform the risk analysis in accordance with existing Federal Aviation Administration Orders and Policy Statements. An example analysis demonstrates the method and tools for calculating uncorrected fleet risk and illustrates the relative significance of the parameters involved in the calculation.",52,2

This work introduces an expanded aerodynamic sensing system for poststall flight conditions that incorporate high angle of attack and prop-wash aerodynamic forces based on in-flight measurement. A flight vehicle with a 1.8 m wingspan is used in wind-tunnel tests to measure the pitch and yaw moments due to freestream and prop-wash over the tail surfaces at high-thrust, low-airspeed conditions including hover. Test data are used to develop two methods to determine in-flight real-time pitch and yaw moments: a probe designed specifically to measure prop-wash flow and a set of pressure sensors embedded throughout the tail surfaces. Through comparisons with torque-transducer measurements also acquired in the wind-tunnel tests, both methods are shown to provide accurate moment estimates at hover and forward-flight conditions. With information directly provided by in-flight measurement, real-time pitch and yaw control can be enhanced using a simple and reliable framework.",52,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032724,"The scope of this paper is to illustrate the installation effects of a turboprop engine on a high-lift configuration of a short takeoff and landing aircraft with circulation control. In addition to the influence on the wing performance, the impact on the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft is also investigated. Furthermore, critical failure cases, namely one engine inoperative, as well as an asymmetric circulation control failure, are assessed. Therefore, steady computational-fluid-dynamics calculations based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations were performed. The propeller is modeled with an actuator-disk approach. The results show strong potential of increasing lift by synergy effects between circulation control and propeller slipstream. However, the longitudinal stability and controllability are adversely affected. Regarding the case of one engine inoperative, the resulting yawing moments are twice as high as the actual yawing moments from the asymmetric thrust and are therefore higher than expected.",52,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032738,"The aeroelastic stability of rectangular plates in subsonic flow is well documented in literature. For example, the stability of a cantilever plate with a clamped edge parallel to the flow is well understood due to the similarity of this system to an aircraft wing. However, an ongoing push for lighter aerospace structures and novel designs requires advancing the understanding of the aeroelastic stability of plates with nonconventional boundary condition combinations. This paper summarizes the aeroelastic theory and experimental results on the flutter and/or divergence mechanisms of a rectangular plate with different sets of structural boundary conditions. The theory combines a linear plate structural model with a three-dimensional vortex lattice aerodynamic mode to create a high-fidelity frequency domain aeroelastic model. The paper also discusses the development of a modular experimental test bed to test the different boundary conditions. A pair of well-understood boundary condition configurations acts as validation points, and then results of additional configurations that have not been extensively explored are presented. The results of this paper can be used to support the design efforts of projects involving plates or plate membranes. In addition, the paper adds to the fundamental understanding of plate aeroelasticity and provides experimental data for comparison and future validation.",52,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032739,"A distributedly actuated morphing wing is designed and demonstrated to achieve a continuous camber variation technique. Cross-shaped flexible honeycombs with overlying silicone facesheets are filled in the trailing edge, which could produce a smooth bending deformation. Mechanical properties of the honeycombs are studied by analytical, simulated, and experimental methods, which indicate that the cross-shaped honeycombs have large in-plane flexibility and out-of-plane stiffness to satisfy the deformation and bearing requirements of the wing. A series of lightweight pressurized telescopic tube actuators are embedded in the trailing-edge surfaces to implement a distributed actuation. Analytical and experimental studies are carried out on the driving force and axial stiffness of the actuators, which show that the actuators could produce a large axial driving force and displacement, and provide a certain compression stiffness to resist part airloads. Simulation and demonstration experiments are conducted to the assembled morphing wing, which show that the trailing edge could achieve the designed deflection and safely bear the airload.",52,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032741,"Tactical aircraft with thin wings and heavy external wing stores are susceptible to aeroelastic limit-cycle oscillations. This investigation applies both frequency-domain and time-domain solutions using aeroelastic computational models to predict limit-cycle oscillation onset, frequency, and amplitude on an F-16. The test configuration uses missile shapes with reconfigurable aerodynamic and mass properties. Statistical analysis of flight-test results identifies significant experimental variables of missile aerodynamic configuration, flight condition, and aircraft fuel state. Furthermore, statistical analysis permits the normalization of flight-test results for direct comparison to aeroelastic models. Results of the comparison show that flight-test data analysis mostly supports the prediction trends, but the magnitude of the aerodynamic effects due to the canards and fins is much less significant in the test data.",52,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032742,"To evaluate the influence of the velvet-like surface mimicking the structure on the suction side of barn owl wings on the flow field and on the aerodynamic performance of the wing, high-speed particle image velocimetry and time-resolved force measurements were performed. The Reynolds number was varied in the range of , and the range of the angles of attack was for the particle image velocimetry measurements and for the force measurements. The flow over a clean-wing model whose geometry corresponds to that of the owl wing without any special adaptations was investigated as a reference case for the same Reynolds number and angle of attack range. This clean wing possesses a laminar separation bubble as the dominant flow feature. Two artificial surfaces were selected to mimic the natural surface concerning the length, density, and thickness of the filaments. The surfaces were able to reduce flow separation. Although this reduction of the separation region might have a positive influence on the pressure drag, the aerodynamic performance of the models with the artificial surfaces was significantly reduced due to the increased skin-friction drag. Furthermore, the models equipped with the velvets possessed a reduced susceptibility to changes in Reynolds number and angle of attack concerning the aerodynamic performance. It can be stated that the velvet surfaces stabilize the flow field at low Reynolds numbers, enabling the owl to fly more slowly and thus more silently.",52,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032748,"To investigate the effect of control-surface freeplay, an aeroelastic wind-tunnel model of a T-tail with freeplay in the control chain was developed. The T-tail rig presents a conventional vertical fin represented only by its main structural component: the main spar. No aerodynamic sectors have been used to reproduce the aerodynamic contribution of a horizontal tail. This was chosen because of the limited size of the wind-tunnel chamber. Two numerical models were developed. The first one describes the dynamics of the tail by a state-space system with nonlinearity represented as a lumped element in the actuator feedback loop, and the second is described by the high-order harmonic balance approach, where the response of the nonlinear system is approximated with a periodic signal. The two approaches are then validated against experimental measurements collected during wind-tunnel testing. The results of this validation process as well the numerical and experimental approaches adopted are reported in this paper.",52,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032754,"Flow about the NASA trapezoidal wing is computed with several turbulence models by using grids from the first high-lift prediction workshop in an effort to advance understanding of computational fluid dynamics modeling for this type of flowfield. Transition is accounted for in many of the computations. In particular, a recently developed four-equation transition model is used and works well overall. Accounting for transition tends to increase lift and decrease moment, which improves agreement with the experiment. Upper surface flap separation is reduced, and agreement with experimental surface pressures and velocity profiles is improved. The predicted shape of wakes from upstream elements is strongly influenced by grid resolution in regions above the main and flap elements. Turbulence model enhancements to account for rotation and curvature have the general effect of increasing lift and improving the resolution of the wing-tip vortex as it convects downstream. However, none of the models improve the prediction of flap surface pressures near the wing tip.",52,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032761,"Different methods of modeling helicopter wakes are presented and compared with available wind-tunnel and flight-test data. A free-wake model was then used to generate the wake vortices of a helicopter hover-taxiing over an airport runway. A hybrid wake model, with a wake decay law, was also used to generate the far wake of a helicopter in level flight. The wake-induced velocity fields were integrated into an aircraft flight dynamics model, and piloted flight simulations were carried out to study a light aircraft encountering a helicopter wake during landing and level flight. It was found that, for the current landing wake-encounter scenario, the existing wake-encounter criteria and severity metrics for the determination of the hazardous distance might not be appropriate if the wake encounter occurs close to the ground. The landing simulation results suggest that, for a helicopter in low-speed hover-taxiing (less than 40 kt airspeed), the wake-encounter detectable horizontal distance is about three times the diameter of the rotor, which coincides with the current safety guidelines of the Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom. The level-flight simulations revealed the effects of the vertical separation distance and of the wake decay on the encounter severity.",52,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032765,"In this paper, a droplet tracking method and a splashing model have been developed to calculate the droplet collection efficiency in a supercooled-large-droplets regime using the Lagrangian computational method. In the droplet tracking method, the droplet deformation and the droplet-wall effects (for example, splashing, bouncing, and reimpingement), which are the typical cases in a supercooled-large-droplets regime, are incorporated by introducing the mass residual ratio. The effects of the transition from the conventional-small-droplets impingement to a supercooled-large-droplets impingement, as well as the splashed secondary droplets, on the droplet collection are considered in the current splashing model. The performance and capacities of the droplet tracking method and the supercooled-large-droplets splashing model are validated against the alternative experimental reference data. The mass loss ratio and the mass back ratio are introduced in order to explore the distribution and the quantity of the mass loss and mass back caused by droplet splashing and reimpingement. The predicted results show that the quantity and the distribution range of the mass back ratio on airfoil surfaces are relatively lower than those of the mass loss ratio. A significant mass back is observed when the airfoil is contaminated with ice. No mass loss or mass back is observed beyond the impinging region for the given conditions.",52,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032764,"This paper introduces a framework that is constructed for target aircraft movement prediction for the autonomous air combat technique. This work is inspired by the common experience that human pilots could foresee future moves of the opponent in combat based on a visual check on the target. Movement of the target is depicted in body coordinates of own aircraft; an infrared/optical image of the target is adopted; orientation of target aircraft is estimated based on image moment-invariants analysis of neural networks; and the target future position is extrapolated based on current position and the estimated orientation. This paper also includes a test report of the proposed framework for classic combat maneuvers, which justifies applicability of the proposed framework.",52,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032774,"A new method based on the theory of set-membership estimation for time-domain identification of helicopter flight dynamics model has been developed. The parameters in most helicopter flight dynamics models are generally coupled, and it is difficult to obtain an explicit-function relationship between an identification model and the parameters to be identified. An indirect-identification algorithm should be established. The concept of generalized noise is introduced to solve the problems using the set-membership-identification method to construct a helicopter flight dynamics model. The identification of a six-degree-of-freedom linear flight dynamics model of the BO-105 helicopter in hover condition based on the new method is implemented. A comparative study of the new method with the maximum-likelihood method is also performed. The obtained results show that the new method increases the identification accuracy, efficiency, and robustness to noise by comparison with a conventional statistic-based identification method.",52,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032772,"The bifurcation analysis method is applied in dealing with shimmy oscillations of the aircraft nose landing gear. Algorithms and details of the procedure in bifurcation analysis are described. Torsional damping of the antiswing damper is studied based on the model consisting of torsional and lateral bending modes of the landing gear. It is concluded that more linear torsional damping means more stability from torsional shimmy, although excessive damping will result in lateral shimmy at the starting speed and low vertical force. The torsional shimmy occurs prior in the area of low speed and midvertical force without sufficient linear damping. And there exists a so-called ideal damping varying with forward speed, with which no shimmy happens in the global scope below a critical vertical force. Squared torsional damping has little influence on the area of shimmy unless Bautin bifurcation appears in the dynamics system, and it is effective in controlling the amplitude of shimmy oscillations. The torsional clearance increases the unstable area of torsional shimmy obviously, but the value of the clearance does not affect the shimmy area.",52,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032775,"A computational-fluid-dynamics-based aeroelastic analysis method is proposed to simulate control-surface limit-cycle oscillation (LCO) induced by freeplay gap. The present method is based on the previously proposed aeroelastic reduced-order model (ROM), in which an unsteady aerodynamic state-space model is generated from aerodynamic responses to step excitation of individual mode using the eigensystem realization algorithm, and connected to a structural dynamic state-space model within the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. The aeroelastic ROM is extended to treat structural nonlinearity due to the control-surface freeplay by generating an additional feedback line of generalized residual forces in the SIMULINK model. To reduce the problem size and the computation time, a fictitious-mass modal approach is used, which can afford the possible local change of stiffness. The present method is first validated for its capability to simulate aeroelastic responses of a regional-jet horizontal-tail (HT) model without freeplay, and shows good prediction of flutter characteristics measured in the transonic flutter wind-tunnel testing. The present method is then applied to the HT model with the elevator freeplay gaps. Although there are some differences between the computed and measured limit-cycle-oscillation ranges, the present method well predicts the nonlinear limit-cycle-oscillation behavior in its amplitude and frequency measured in the test, and shows promise toward accurate prediction of control-surface LCO due to its freeplay gap.",52,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032776,"Through aeroelastic effects, the various structural parameters of a wing can have significant effects on the flight dynamics of any size of aerial vehicle. If these parameters could be manipulated in flight, the aeroelastic interactions could, in turn, be leveraged for control purposes. If done properly, this approach has the potential to yield a significant improvement over conventional control surfaces for highly aeroelastic vehicles in terms of maneuverability. In this paper, the preliminary analysis of a proposed structural system with this capability is presented. The proposed system is a combination of a highly flexible conventionally configured wing structure, piezoelectric actuation, and a feedback loop. This system embeds a haptic system into the rear spar of the wing, the effects of which are adjustable by means of a gain parameter. The analysis presented in this paper shows the feasibility of the design and effectiveness of an unoptimized configuration, relocating the flexural axis by approximately 22%. This preliminary analysis establishes that the presented structural-parameter-actuation design, termed flexural-axis control, is practical and realizable.",52,2

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032781,"An experimental investigation was conducted on a supersonic flow at a freestream Mach number of 2 over a shallow open cavity, including the effects of adding streamwise serrated edges. These flows have relevance to weapons bays and airframe gaps on high-speed aircraft. The measurements consisted of single-shot and time-resolved schlieren visualization, as well as unsteady pressure spectra. The length-to-depth ratio of the cavity was 8. The tests conducted at different Reynolds numbers with the baseline cavity (straight leading and trailing edges) showed that increasing the Reynolds number increases the root-mean-square pressure inside the cavity. The addition of serrations to the cavity leading or trailing edge did not show any significant effect on the separating shear layer nor in controlling the oscillations of the shear layer. There was also no noticeable effect on the overall sound pressure levels inside the cavity. A new expression for calculating shallow-cavity resonant frequencies applicable at supersonic Mach numbers is proposed. It is shown that it compares well with experiments and the well-known modified Rossiter relation.",52,2

A human strategy modeling method is proposed in this paper to generate very large sample sizes of flight data for safety analysis. Three kinds of characteristic patterns are formulated and critically coupled to implement fast-time simulations of a man–aircraft–environment complex system with a human strategy model as the core. An instantiation of this human strategy model for the final approach and landing mission is developed and integrated into a digital flight deck. The results of five controlled experiments manifest that the human strategy model is flexible in testing different conditions to obtain flight data that may be valuable for safety recommendations. With stochastic optimization factors and recursive feedback dynamics in piloting problems having been addressed, the human strategy model is potentially capable for the extension of automation and the enhancement of safety.",52,2
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032808,"The pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure concept, developed by The Boeing Company, has been extensively studied as part of NASA’s environmentally responsible aviation project. The pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure concept provides a lightweight alternative to aluminum or traditional composite design concepts and is applicable to traditional-shaped fuselage barrels and wings, as well as advanced configurations such as a hybrid wing–body or truss-braced wings. Therefore, NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and The Boeing Company partnered in an effort to assess the performance and damage arrestments capabilities of the pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure concept by testing a full-scale curved panel in the Federal Aviation Administration full-scale aircraft structural test evaluation and research facility. Testing was conducted in this facility by subjecting the panel to axial tension loads applied to the ends of the panel, internal pressure, and combined axial tension and internal pressure loadings. Additionally, reactive hoop loads were applied to the skin and frames of the panel along its edges. The panel successfully supported the required design loads in the pristine condition and with a severed stiffener. The panel also demonstrated that the pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure concept could arrest the progression of damage, including crack arrestment and crack turning. This paper presents the nonlinear posttest analysis and correlation with test results for the curved pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure panel. It is shown that nonlinear analysis can accurately calculate the behavior of this panel under tension, pressure, and combined loading conditions.",52,2

Techniques are presented to develop experimental calibration designs used to calibrate these instruments, with consideration given to accounting for physical limitations existing within these calibration systems.

23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032824,"A simple and reasonable mathematical model is developed to simulate ice accretions on three-dimensional bodies directly. Based on the extended heat-transfer model proposed by Myers, this paper brings forward the concept of critical ice thickness as a criterion for the existence of overflow in every icing control volume. Besides, the concept of inner time step is proposed. After each inner time step, the ice-layer thickness and associated icing properties including the ice accretion rate and overflow in all icing control volumes will be updated to make the model more close to the physical reality. Then, the method for deciding the outflow through boundaries of each icing control volume is given based on the contravariant air velocity components just above the icing surface. Ice accretions under typical glaze ice conditions on a GLC-305 swept-wing model are calculated, and the predicted sectional ice shapes are compared with the experimental data as well as LEWICE results. It indicates that the current results reflect some major characteristics of glaze ice and the spanwise overflow phenomenon.

A simple dynamic model with five degrees of freedom is derived with the aid of Lagrangian formulation, which explicitly avoids any constraint force in the equations of motion. The longitudinal and lateral–directional modes and stability of the steady flight under constant wind conditions are analyzed by using both numerical and analytical methods. Taking advantage of the appearance of small dimensionless parameters in the model, useful analytical formulas for stable-designed kites are found. Under nonsteady wind-velocity conditions, the equilibrium state disappears and periodic orbits occur. The kite stability and an interesting resonance phenomenon are explored with the aid of a numerical method based on Floquet theory.",52,2

A test campaign involving high-level measurement techniques, such as microdrag evaluation, near-wall laser Doppler velocimetry, and oil-film interferometry, has been carried out at several Mach numbers from 0.5 to 1.3 to quantify the impact of a large range of flat-plate imperfections. Forward-facing and backward-facing plain and chamfered steps of different heights have been studied. A whole numerical study, based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations, has been completed and used for validation purposes. Given the very small order of magnitude of the forces to be measured and calculated, the relative comparison between experimental and numerical outcomes is satisfactory. Even if some local discrepancies exist, results show an overall good agreement in the positioning of the different imperfection drag productions.

A new combined-load test fixture was designed and used in these experiments. There were a total of six large rectangular stiffened panels in the size of 960 by 850 mm, which were classified in two groups according to the cross section and layout of their stiffeners. Three panels, named J panels, were designed in four parallel J-shaped stiffeners. Another three panels, named X panels, were designed in eight orthogonal blade-shaped stiffeners. Strain rosettes bonded back-to-back on the skin were used to measure the strains of skin at their locations in three directions (0, 45, and 90 deg), whereas the strain gauges installed on the stiffeners were used to measure the strains of stiffeners in a single direction. The integrally stiffened panels were loaded up to a sudden drop of the applied load and an accompanying harsh noise caused by the stringers splitting from skins. All the test panels failed in the same modes of global flexural buckling and the spitting of the stiffeners from skins. The mean value of the first buckling loads of X panels is 11.6% higher than that of the J panels. The mean value of the failure loads of X panels is 1.5% less than that of the J panels.

The structure considered is the pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure, a highly integrated composite structure concept designed for a noncylindrical, next-generation flight vehicle fuselage. Modifications to a baseline design are evaluated within a six-parameter design space including spacing, flange width, and web height for both frame and stringer substructure components. The change in sound power radiation attributed to a design change is predicted using finite-element models sized and meshed for analyses in the 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz octave bands. Three design studies are carried out in parallel while considering a diffuse acoustic field excitation and two types of turbulent boundary-layer excitation. Kriging surrogate models are used to reduce the computational costs of resolving the vibroacoustic and weight objective Pareto fronts. The resulting Pareto optimal designs are then evaluated under a static pressurization ultimate load to assess structural strength and stability. Results suggest that choosing alternative configurations within the considered design space can reduce weight and improve vibroacoustic performance without compromising strength and stability of the structure under the static load condition considered, but the tradeoffs are significantly influenced by the spatial characteristics of the assumed excitation field.",52,2
