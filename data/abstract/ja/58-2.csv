But the complexity cost of a variable-pitch propeller is too high to be applied to small propellers. To achieve the propeller pitch variability with minimum mechanic complexity and weight cost, an aerostable concept was used in the design of the blades. In this case, the propeller pitch was variable under the aerodynamic moment. First, the simulation method based on the computational fluid dynamics was validated by experiments of the NACA 5868-9 propeller and Gall’s biplane/winglet configuration. Second, the propeller design process for a four-blade aerostable propeller with high disk loading was presented. The design was based on the Blade Element Momentum Theory, with a section aerodynamic database modeled by an artificial neural network. To eliminate dynamic imbalance moment, a prebalance method based on the Parallel-Axis Theorem was established. Third, the thrust, power, and efficiency of the designed propeller was analyzed in both S/VTOL and cruise condition. The trim points of the blade were analyzed, and the pitch moment coefficient and the stability margin of the blade were discussed.",58,2

To investigate the influence of the propeller slipstream on a wing surface, the flowfield on the wing surface is visualized using a temperature-sensitive paint when the chord-based Reynolds number is equal to . The control surface performance improves in the installed-propeller condition because the propeller slipstream suppresses the laminar separation bubble. Finally, we suggest that the propeller should be installed ahead of the control surface to benefit from the effect of the propeller slipstream under the low-Reynolds-number flight condition.",58,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035850,"Earlier work did not find any static stiffness nonlinearities in the F-16 wing structure, but suggested that dynamic nonlinearities may be present. Computational studies have demonstrated that small amounts of nonlinear structural damping are sufficient to change a diverging flutter oscillation into a limited amplitude oscillation. Experimental damping measurements of a fixture-mounted F-16 wing were made to determine whether damping nonlinearities are significant and to quantify the nature of any structural damping present in the built-up wing structure. Three fundamental component configurations of the wing were examined: wing box only, wing (i.e., wing box with leading- and trailing-edge control surfaces), and wing with wingtip launcher. A ground vibration test approach was used with a stepped-sine excitation technique over a range of excitation forces. Damping and frequency were extracted from measured frequency response functions of the stepped-sine test data using a modified single degree-of-freedom modal analysis technique. Nonlinear damping with respect to bending mode displacement was observed for all test configurations. The overall magnitude of the damping increased when control surfaces were installed on the wing box. The presence of a wingtip launcher decreased the damping at higher displacements.",58,2

However, the aeroelastic or aeromechanical behaviors of a double-swept rotor helicopter are a challenge to helicopter flight safety and need to be investigated. In this paper, the aeromechanical stability of a bearingless rotor helicopter with double-swept blades is studied. The analytical model of the double-swept blade rotor/fuselage coupled system is developed by using 10 coordinate systems to describe the motion of an arbitrary point in the double-swept blade. The influences of the double-swept parameters including the inner swept-forward angle, outer swept-back angle, outer droop angle, and junction position of double-swept parts on the aeromechanical stability in ground contact condition and for the forward flight condition are investigated. Analytical results show that the double-swept blade can increase the critical rotational speed in the ground contact condition and improve the aeromechanical stability in forward flight. The outer droop angle can stabilize the rotor/fuselage coupled system. Parameters related to the outer swept-back part generally have more influence on the stability than those of the inner swept-forward part. The influence of the double-swept blade on the aeromechanical stability increases with increasing the swept-back angle of the outer swept-back part and decreases with increasing the starting position of the outer swept-back part.",58,2

To effectively account for the aerodynamic interference between the multiple aerodynamic surfaces of the QTR unmanned aerial vehicle, a hybrid optimization trimming analysis method based on Immune Algorithm/Levenberg–Marquardt (IA/LM) and lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is proposed. The aerodynamic characteristics between the wing and the rotor calculated by the LBM are compensated into the flight dynamics model. The IA/LM algorithm is used to reduce the dependence on the initial trimming value. The effectiveness of the hybrid optimal trimming analysis method is verified through the analysis of trimming simulation results.",58,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035992,"Research interest is growing for theoretical models of highly deflected structures in aeroelastic settings. Presented here is a model of a cantilevered plate subjected to axial supersonic flow to determine the flutter boundary and postflutter characteristics of a system such as a trailing edge control surface. The structural model is a nonlinear inextensible beam model with inertia and stiffness geometric nonlinearities, while the aerodynamic model used is both first-order linear and third-order nonlinear Piston Theory with a new geometric modification to account for large deflections of the cantilevered configuration. Comparisons are made between linear and nonlinear structural models as well as linear and nonlinear Piston Theory, with and without this new geometric modification. It is shown that the model is highly sensitive to the inclusion of each nonlinear aerodynamic or structural component and that the new geometric modification to Piston Theory leads to stable limit cycles which otherwise may be unstable. Finally, the use of Piston Theory for these unconventionally large deflections is validated by comparing pressures on the structure to those computed by the Euler equations acting on the structure’s prescribed motion.",58,2

However, the extrusion and friction of the seal will induce the increment frictional loading on the slat driver. In the present Paper, a rigid–flexible body configuration model of the increment frictional loading was proposed based on multibody dynamics and theory of elasticity, and the increment frictional loading caused by the slat seal was calculated and analyzed. Besides, the influences of friction coefficient and temperature on the incremental frictional loading were investigated. The results will provide a guidance reference in simulation analysis and experimental verification methods for designing the slat seals in aircraft.",58,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035869,"Spatially distributed load on aircraft structures is difficult to obtain due to the limitation of measurement technology, the complexity of load and the external environment of the aircraft during flight, etc. A load identification method based on a subregion interpolation technique is proposed to indirectly estimate the distributed dynamic load from measured strain data on planar structures. The load distribution area is discretized into several subregions and the load distribution function in each subregion is represented by a set of local interpolation functions multiplied by their corresponding coefficients. A modified Green’s function matrix is formulated to establish the relationship between the local distributed dynamic load in the domain composed of the subregions sharing the same node and the structural response data. Hence, both the load’s distribution and time histories can be identified from structural response by solving the new formulated inverse problem. Numerical simulations on a flat cantilever plate and a planar structure with irregular geometry are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method has better adaptability on the types of load distribution and structural configurations than the existing methods.",58,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035849,"Some of the existing challenges of fixed-wing micro aerial vehicle designs at low Reynolds number are low lift and reduced aerodynamic efficiency. Delta wings, despite their characteristic maneuverability, are rarely used for micro aerial vehicles, perhaps due to the limited lifting capacity because of the reduced aspect ratio. Corrugations on insect wings are ubiquitous and augment the aerodynamic performance in a similar Reynolds number regime. Herein, corrugations are applied to enhance the lift and aerodynamic efficiency of a delta wing. Three delta-wing geometries are examined using numerical simulations at a Reynolds number of : a nonslender delta wing with 53 deg leading-edge sweep and two variants with corrugations in the rear planform. The simulations reveal that the variants potentially offer approximately 11 and 27% increments in the aerodynamic efficiency and the lift, respectively, over the conventional delta wing at an angle of attack of 5 deg. Moreover, the corrugations strengthen the leading-edge vortices and generate an additional nosedown moment about the leading edge. The introduction of corrugations on micro aerial vehicle wings could be a passive technique to potentially improve the aerodynamic characteristics, without any significant weight or drag penalty.",58,2

The upper limit of droplet deformation and the minimum distance to the airfoil model at which the breakup onset takes place have been modeled. Three analytical equations have been developed based on the combination of two models: a droplet deformation and trajectory model for droplets in a continuously accelerated flowfield, and a breakup model for droplets in the vicinity of a leading edge of an airfoil model. The verification was made using experimental data obtained for water droplets whose diameters were in the range from 400 to impinging on airfoils of three different chord sizes moving at velocities from 50 to . The rotating arm facility at National Institute of Aerospace Technology was used for this purpose. The analytical equations of the model were in good agreement with the experimental data. The upper limit of droplet deformation was verified by 95.40% of the tested experimental cases, and the minimum distance to the airfoil was verified in 99.65% of the cases.",58,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035954,"Formation flight has the potential to significantly reduce aircraft fuel consumption by allowing “follower” aircraft to fly in the aerodynamic wake of “leader” aircraft. However, this requirement for aircraft to be in close proximity for large parts of their journey raises questions about the suitability of flying in formation given the diverse range of existing flights and geographical regions. This paper demonstrates the potential for two-aircraft formation flight for three distinct case studies: long-haul airline, transatlantic airline, and low-cost airline, encompassing a range of typical airline regions and characteristics. The results indicate, even with only minor scheduling alterations, the potential fuel savings could result in saving hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel costs and reducing millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. An analytical geometric method for calculating all possible combinations of optimal routes is presented. This is coupled with a mixed integer linear program for providing an assignment of aircraft into formation pairs. A number of different key metrics, correlations, and predictive indicators help to determine which flights, airlines, and regions show “good” formation potential. Importantly, this paper also demonstrates these results for a wide range of drag-reduction possibilities and the impact this has on achievable fuel saving.",58,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035994,"Implementations of lifting-line theory predict the lift of a finite wing using a sheet of semi-infinite vortices extending from a vortex filament placed along the locus of aerodynamic centers of the wing. Prandtl’s classical implementation is restricted to straight wings in flows without side slip. In this Paper, it is shown that lifting-line theory can be extended to swept wings if, at the control points where induced velocity is calculated, the second derivative of the locus of aerodynamic centers is zero and the trailing vortices are perpendicular to the locus of aerodynamic centers. Therefore, a general implementation of lifting-line theory is presented that conditionally forces the second derivative of the locus of aerodynamic centers to zero at each control point and joints each trailing vortex such that there is a finite segment of the trailing vortex that lies perpendicular to the locus of aerodynamic centers. Consideration is given to modeling the locus of aerodynamic centers and section aerodynamic properties of swept wings. The resulting general formulation is analyzed to determine sensitivity to closure parameters, accuracy, and numerical convergence. The general implementation demonstrates approximately second-order convergence when the control points are cosine clustered and produces results that closely match those of a higher-order panel method and experimental data, though requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.",58,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035985,"Technology forecasting is an essential starting point for conceptual design of any complex engineering system. In fact, many research projects are focused on developing a small set of promising technologies to a suitable readiness level. However, selecting a set of technologies from a larger pool is a nontrivial task, opposed by uncertainty and subjective tradeoffs. This paper proposes a probabilistic method to represent technologies and quantify their effects, while accounting for uncertainty. Using probabilistic inversion, technologies can be selected from a larger set to meet a certain combination of requirements. Several test cases illustrate the method and how it may be used in conceptual design projects. It is concluded that probabilistic inversion enables answering technology development and selection queries, which would be challenging to answer with traditional deterministic approaches, or purely forward uncertainty propagation approaches.",58,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035857,"In this Paper, the wake dynamics of coaxial rotors are studied using the high-wake-resolution method. The high-wake-resolution method is a novel combination of the truncated vortex tube model for initial and boundary conditions and the wave-number-extended finite-volume interpolation scheme. The wake resolution of this method is verified by comparison with other general computational fluid dynamics techniques. By using this method, this Paper analyses the wake dynamics of coaxial rotors with different inter-rotor spacing. The aerodynamic characteristics of coaxial rotors are compared with those of single-rotor systems to identify the effect of wake interaction on coaxial rotor blades. Variations of thrust and sectional thrust coefficients indicate that the lower rotor is continuously influenced by the wake of the upper rotor. In addition, the blade/vortex interaction and the wake instability phenomena are observed near the lower rotor. Aerodynamics and wake dynamics are strongly correlated with inter-rotor spacing. Details of important features such as the wake trajectory, miss distance of each rotor, blade-vortex interaction phenomenon, and wake instability at different inter-rotor spacing are discussed.",58,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035956,"The paper presents computational prediction of aerodynamic hysteresis loops in static conditions for a two-dimensional aerofoil that was used as a cross-section profile for a rectangular wing with an aspect ratio of five, tested in the TsAGI T-106 wind tunnel at a Reynolds number of and a Mach number of . Tests in the wind tunnel showed that minor changes in the curvature of the leading edge of the thin aerodynamic profile lead to a significant increase in the maximum lift coefficient when significant hysteresis loops appear in the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing. The computational predictions of stall aerodynamics presented in this paper are made for a two-dimensional profile using the OpenFOAM open-source code to simulate a flow based on the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations using the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. The calculation results confirm the existence of loops of static aerodynamic hysteresis and bistable structures of the separated flow, and the results are qualitatively similar to the results observed experimentally on the wing with a finite aspect ratio.",58,2
