2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032888,"Multivariate-orthogonal-function modeling was applied to wind-tunnel databases for eight different aircraft to identify a generic global aerodynamic model structure that could be used for any of the aircraft. For each aircraft database and each nondimensional aerodynamic coefficient, global models were identified from multivariate polynomials in the nondimensional states and controls, using an orthogonalization procedure. A predicted-square-error criterion was used to automatically select the model terms. Modeling terms selected in at least half of the analyses, which totaled 45 terms, were retained to form the generic global aerodynamic model structure. Least squares was used to estimate the model parameters and associated uncertainty that best fit the generic global aerodynamic model structure to each database. The result was a single generic aerodynamic model structure that could be used to accurately characterize the global aerodynamics for any of the eight aircraft, simply by changing the values of the model parameters. Nonlinear flight simulations were used to demonstrate that the generic global aerodynamic model accurately reproduces trim solutions, local dynamic behavior, and global dynamic behavior under large-amplitude excitation. This compact global aerodynamic model can decrease flight-computer memory requirements for implementing onboard fault detection or flight control systems, enable quick changes for conceptual aircraft models, and provide smooth analytical functional representations of the global aerodynamics for control and optimization applications. All information required to construct global aerodynamic models for nonlinear simulations of the eight aircraft is provided in this paper.",52,1

The emphasis is on calculating the scattered noise with a tailored Green’s function and on discussing the impact of the scattering effect. The aerodynamic noises from a circular cylinder and a NACA 0012 airfoil in half-space are studied and compared with that in free space, and the influence of the scattering effect on the noise field is investigated. Numerical results illustrate similar characteristics in compressible fluid calculation and acoustic calculation, and thus the aeroacoustic integral method in half-space can accurately predict the scattered noise induced by complex-shaped configurations. This method simplifies the calculation of scattering sources and improves the computational efficiency of aerodynamic noise in physical space including the ground effect.",52,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032364,"The efficiency and mechanism of slat noise suppression with upstream mass injection was investigated through validated numerical simulations. Delayed detached-eddy simulation was used to describe the noise sources and Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings integration was carried out to obtain the far-field noise characteristics. Outward mass injection from the suction side of the slat near the cusp uplifted the free shear layer, and the corresponding impingement of free shear layer with slat pressure surface was alleviated. The tonal component of the far-field noise was diminished, and the suppression of the broadband noise was also observed. The inward injection of mass at the pressure side of the slat near the cusp facilitated the three-dimensional flow and the breakup of large-scale spanwise vortices, weakening the strength of the free shear layer, especially at the vicinity of the reattachment point. However, the introduction of strong turbulence at the downstream of the injection slot offset the benefits gained from the suppression of unsteadiness at the reattachment area. Although the low-frequency sound pressure level was lowered, two new strong peaks arose at higher frequencies, which contributed to a higher overall sound pressure level at the upstream direction below the airfoil.",52,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032579,"Wake-vortex hazards are a huge threat in aviation. These hazards are well accepted in the vicinity of airports (both departure and arrival). But also a number of en route incidents have happened in the past. Current wake-vortex mitigation strategies are based on static distances (in space and/or time). In future air traffic management concepts of Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research and NextGen, these static distances will be replaced by dynamic separation strategies. Furthermore, concepts for self-separation of aircraft are described. This paper will discuss the work at Technische Universität Braunschweig, where a new concept for wake-vortex hazard mitigation has been developed. The basic idea of the new concept is that only a criticality parameter will be transmitted between aircraft to ensure a safe separation even within new self-separation concepts. The criticality parameter will give an indication about the severity (and therefore criticality to the following aircraft) of the vortices. Additionally, Technische Universität Braunschweig will install wind-turbulence measurement equipment onboard its research aircraft. This installation will be also be described, and the possible usage will be discussed.",52,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032583,"Boundary-layer stability analyses of mean flows extracted from unstructured-grid Navier–Stokes solutions have been performed. A procedure has been developed to extract mean flow profiles from the FUN3D unstructured-grid solutions for the purpose of stability analysis. Extensive code-to-code validations were performed by comparing the extracted mean flows as well as the corresponding stability characteristics to the predictions based on structured-grid mean flow solutions. Comparisons were made for a set of progressively complex geometric configurations ranging from a simple flat plate to a full aircraft configuration: a modified Gulfstream III with a natural laminar-flow glove. The results for the swept wing flow over the wing–glove assembly point to the need for stability analysis based on Navier–Stokes solutions or possibly fully three-dimensional boundary-layer codes when the underlying flow develops strong three-dimensionality. The effect of grid resolution, mean flow convergence, and low-order interpolation to a stability grid on metrics relevant to linear stability of the boundary-layer flow are also examined to provide guidelines for the use of both structured and unstructured grids in practical applications related to transition prediction for swept wing boundary layers.",52,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032597,"A new method for modeling the interaction of an aerofoil with a gust using a prescribed velocity approach, called the split velocity method is presented. This approach effectively rearranges the governing equations into a form that allows for more efficient calculation and includes both the effect of the gust on the aerofoil and the effect of the aerofoil on the gust. The convection of gusts, through the domain from the far field, is investigated using the new method for a range of 1-cosine gusts. The results obtained are compared to an existing prescribed velocity approach called the field velocity method, which neglects the effect of the aerofoil on the gust. The two prescribed velocity approaches agree well for longer gusts. For shorter gusts where the gust length is close to the chord of the aerofoil, the new approach produces better results. Details of a linearized version of the split velocity method are also given. The linearized version is shown to agree well with the full method for cases when the gust does not result in large shock motions.",52,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032601,"Laminar-turbulent transition may have considerable influence on the performance of moderate and high-speed aerodynamic vehicles. The two recently developed transition-sensitive models, SST-TR and , are employed to assess their abilities in resolving the complex underlying flow physics associated with flow structures over delta wings. In particular, their capabilities in capturing the aerodynamic characteristics of three-dimensional flow associated with vortex breakdown, shear-layer instabilities, and boundary-layer transition are assessed. These closures are employed to simulate vortex breakdown and near-wall flow structures over a delta wing planform with a moderate sweep angle of 50 deg at a Reynolds number of , where a combination of laminar, transitional, and turbulent flowfields coexist. Accuracy of these models in predicting boundary-layer transition adjacent to a delta wing surface with a high-sweep angle of 70 deg and Reynolds numbers of and is investigated. Large-eddy simulation with dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid scale model is also employed to assess its capability in predicting transition on delta wing planforms. All numerical simulations are compared with available experimental data found in the literature.",52,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032619,"Failure or damage events that degrade performance pose significant risk to aircraft in flight. Adaptive control and system identification may stabilize a damaged aircraft, but identified models may be valid only near each local operating point. This paper presents a novel guidance strategy designed to discover a set of feasible flight states sufficient to enable a safe landing given an unknown degradation event. Rather than persistently exciting the aircraft with the potential to cause further damage, the aircraft may instead be progressively guided through a sequence of trim states that are stabilizable given local envelope estimates. The proposed guidance strategy progressively explores trim state space rather than three-dimensional physical space, identifying a set of low-speed gentle-descent trim states appropriate for landing approach. A potential field method is adapted to steer exploration through trim state space, modeling envelope constraint boundaries as obstacles and desirable approach trim states as attractors. Identified paths through trim state space may present physical-space conflicts such as flight into terrain. To cope, the family of trajectories emanating from the current trim state is propagated in physical space to identify and eliminate physical conflicts. F-16 aileron and rudder jam performance degradation scenarios are presented, showing that the trim state discovery algorithm can effectively explore trim state space without violating vehicle performance or environmental constraints.",52,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032634,"A meta aircraft is an air vehicle composed of a set of independent aircraft that are connected together in flight to form a larger composite aircraft. This paper explores the dynamics of meta aircraft systems with a focus on the changes in the aircraft flight dynamic modes and flexible modes of the system. Specifically, when aircraft are connected, basic flight dynamic modes such as the phugoid, short period, dutch roll, spiral, and roll modes change as a function of the number of connected aircraft. For aircraft connected in a wing-tip-to-wing-tip configuration, the longitudinal modes remain largely invariant with respect to the number of aircraft, whereas lateral modes are variable for both tip-to-tail and wing-tip-to-wing-tip connection configurations. In addition, connected aircraft exhibit complex flexible modes that change based on the characteristics of the connection joint and the number of connected aircraft. These conclusions are reached using a rigid six-degree-of-freedom representation for a single aircraft, where aircraft are connected through a set of linear and rotational elastic elements modeling the connection mechanism. Aerodynamic loads from all lifting surfaces are computed using a nonlinear lifting-line approach to enable aerodynamic wake interactions between connected aircraft.",52,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032633,"This paper discusses the control methodology, flight dynamics identification, and disturbance rejection analysis in hover of a revolutionary horizontal-axis rotary-wing concept: the twin cyclocopter. The vehicle has a gross weight of 500 g (1.25 by 1.67 by 1 ft in dimensions) and comprises two highly optimized cyclorotors along with a tail rotor for pitch control. Stable hover flight required fast control of the rpm and thrust vectoring of the rotors through onboard feedback regulation. A six-degree-of-freedom flight dynamics model of the vehicle was extracted through input excitation and time-domain identification. The longitudinal and heave degrees of freedom were decoupled and independent from the rest of the dynamics. Longitudinal translation damping was higher than in the heave mode, indicating differences in restoring forces at different blade azimuth positions due to the different pitch angles. Strong gyroscopic coupling was observed between lateral and yaw degrees of freedom because the rotors spin in the same direction, resulting in unbalanced angular momentum, which is an important characteristic of the twin cyclocopter. Coupling between lateral velocity perturbation and yaw response was also observed. Analysis based on a control-theoretic framework indicated sufficient maneuverability potential of the vehicle in open-loop condition. The longitudinal and lateral gust tolerances were calculated to be about 7.9 and , respectively.",52,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032576,"This paper describes the maturation of a control allocation technique designed to assist pilots in recovery from pilot-induced oscillations. The control allocation technique to recover from pilot-induced oscillations is designed to enable next-generation high-efficiency aircraft designs. Energy-efficient next-generation aircraft require feedback control strategies that will enable lowering the actuator rate limit requirements for optimal airframe design. A common issue on aircraft with actuator rate limitations is they are susceptible to pilot-induced oscillations caused by the phase lag between the pilot inputs and control surface response. The control allocation technique to recover from pilot-induced oscillations uses real-time optimization for control allocation to eliminate phase lag in the system caused by control surface rate limiting. System impacts of the control allocator were assessed through a piloted simulation evaluation of a nonlinear aircraft model in the NASA Ames Research Center’s Vertical Motion Simulator. Results indicate that the control allocation technique to recover from pilot-induced oscillations helps reduce oscillatory behavior introduced by control surface rate limiting, including the pilot-induced oscillation tendencies reported by pilots.",52,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032636,"The development of micro aerial vehicles has been hindered by a poor understanding of the flight dynamics associated with the unique aerodynamic regime. This study experimentally estimates the aerodynamic damping derivatives of flat-plate wings with aspect ratios less than 3 at a Reynolds number of ; when combined with previously published results detailing the lateral and longitudinal static loads, a dynamic model is developed for low-aspect-ratio wings. The initial-condition response of the linear equations of motion shows that the loading created by roll stall results in purely aerodynamic lateral modes which, unlike conventional aircraft, are not attributed to geometric features, such as the vertical tail; this response was favorably compared with the integration of the full nonlinear equations. The mode is manifested by divergent, high-amplitude perturbations in sideslip, bank angle, and roll rate; furthermore, it is seen to be affected by angle of attack variations, which significantly alter the instantaneous value of the roll stability derivative . If the input frequency of the angle of attack oscillations is close to the natural frequency of the pure lateral mode, the bank angle is seen to drift away from its equilibrium value due to an attenuated restoring roll moment. This represents a previously unconsidered stability mode, referred to as roll-resonance, which couples the lateral and longitudinal stability axes for small perturbations from equilibrium flight conditions.",52,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032657,"Compounding has often been proposed as a method to increase the maximum speed of the helicopter. There are two common types of compounding known as wing and thrust compounding. Wing compounding offloads the rotor at high speeds, delaying the onset of retreating blade stall, and hence increasing the maximum achievable speed, whereas with thrust compounding, axial thrust provides additional propulsive force. There has been a resurgence of interest in the configuration due to the emergence of new requirements for speeds greater than those of conventional helicopters. The aim of this paper is to investigate the dynamic stability characteristics of compound helicopters and compare the results with a conventional helicopter. The paper discusses the modeling of two compound helicopters, which are named the coaxial compound and hybrid compound helicopters. Their respective trim results are contrasted with a conventional helicopter model. Furthermore, using a numerical differentiation technique, the dynamic stability of each configuration is assessed. The results show that the frequency of the coaxial compound helicopter’s Dutch roll mode is less than that of the conventional helicopter, and there is greater roll damping. Concerning the hybrid compound helicopter, there is greater roll damping and the phugoid mode stabilizes at high speeds.",52,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032628,"This study investigates the performance of detached-eddy simulation to simulate the flow control by a synthetic jet around an airfoil. The effect of the jet exit angle is focused on. The detached-eddy simulation approach is first validated with a nonblowing, high-angle-of-attack case. Flows around a NACA 0012 airfoil including the synthetic jet cavity and its orifice at 10% chord location are then simulated at 12 deg angle of attack and Reynolds number of . The jet exit angles of 45, 60, 75, and 90 deg have been studied. Massively separated flows were eliminated in all cases. The angles of 45 and 60 deg successfully recovered stably attached flow over the airfoil with small amplitude of the aerodynamic forces, while the flow unsteadiness due to remaining separation is observed at higher jet exit angles, resulting in large amplitude of the drag force.",52,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032660,"Against a background of increasing energy demand and rising fuel prices, hybrid-electric propulsion systems have the potential to significantly reduce fuel consumption in the aviation industry, particularly in the lighter sectors. By taking advantage of both electric motor and internal combustion engine, hybrid-electric propulsion systems provide not only a benefit in fuel saving but also a reduction in takeoff noise and the emission levels. This research considers the design and sizing process of a hybrid-electric propulsion system for a single-seat demonstrator aircraft, the experimental derivation of the internal combustion engine map, and the electric motor parameters. In addition to the experimental data, a novel modeling approach including several linked desktop PC software packages is presented to analyze and optimize hybrid-electric technology for aircraft. Further to the analysis of a parallel hybrid-electric, midscale aircraft, this paper also presents a scaling approach for a 20 kg unmanned aerial vehicle and a 50 ton intercity airliner. At the smaller scale, two different mission profiles are analyzed: an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance mission profile and a maximum-duration profile. At the larger scale, the performance of a 50 ton intercity airliner is modeled, based on a hybrid-electric gas turbine, assuming a range of electric boost powers and battery masses.",52,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032668,"A novel integrated planning and guidance concept has been developed that optimizes aircraft trajectories from top of descent to the runway threshold to achieve a continuous engine-idle descent. The new concept, named time and energy managed operations, aims at reducing noise, gaseous emissions, and fuel burn while maintaining airport landing capacity by means of time management. Time and energy managed operations uses an optimization algorithm to minimize thrust and speed brake use through energy management by exchanging kinetic and potential energy. Sustained deviations during descent are corrected using a strategic or tactical approach. Time and energy managed operations is evaluated in a batch simulation study for various disturbances to test its robustness to disturbances and time constraints. Moreover, two different methods of correcting deviations are compared. Results show that time and energy managed operations allows idle descents while adhering to time constraints and can cope with disturbances and updated time constraints. Large wind estimation errors degrade time and energy managed operations performance.",52,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032652,"This study focuses on the benefits of using nanocomposites in aerospace structural components to prevent or delay the occurrence of unique composite failure modes, such as delamination. A three-scale approach was considered to determine the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. First, the effective carbon nanotube properties were calculated based on the composite cylinder assemblage method. Second, the effective properties of the carbon nanotube embedded in an epoxy matrix were obtained using the Mori–Tanaka method. Finally, the effective properties of the composite lamina were also acquired using the Mori–Tanaka method assuming that the nanocomposite obtained in stage two was the matrix of that lamina surrounding the fibers. These properties were then used to analyze the structural response of a -section stringer using detailed finite element models. The stringer was analyzed under different loading conditions and assuming different flaw types in the structure. Initial damage was detected via the virtual crack closure technique implemented in the finite element analysis, and it was assumed to be the characteristic variable to compare the different behaviors. It was found that the use of nanocomposites in the manufacturing process of composite stringers would improve the overall performance against unique composite failure modes.",52,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032107,"Ice accretion on the inlet of an aeroengine could adversely affect the characteristics of the flowfield into the engine and degrade the engine’s performance. When the accrued ice sheds, the portion sucked into the engine could induce serious damage. One method to reduce hazards caused by in-flight icing is an anti-icing system that uses hot lubricating oil from the engine rather than using hot air. This method not only decreases the amount of anti-icing hot air required but also cools the lubrication oil. This paper presents a computational study of the temperature distribution of an aeroengine strut under icing conditions. The flowfield around the strut is simulated using a computational fluid dynamics code. The trajectories of the supercooled water droplets are calculated through the Lagrangian approach after the computation of the air flowfield. A statistical approach is employed to calculate the local collection coefficient on the strut surface. The coupling effects of heat transfer and mass transfer are considered in the temperature calculation of the strut studied. The thermal model takes both the mass balance of water and energy balance on the surface of the strut into account. The convection heat transfer coefficients on the surface of the strut are obtained through two methods: correlation equations and computational fluid dynamics calculations. Finally, comparisons between the computational results and the experimental data are presented. The computational fluid dynamics prediction of the surface temperature of the strut shows satisfactory agreement with the experimental data.",52,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032675,"Evaluation of the conventional linear wall-interference correction method is conducted using flows around a two-dimensional airfoil in a wind tunnel computed by computational fluid dynamics and a porous wall model. First, the computational results are validated by comparison with wind-tunnel test measurements. Then, the wall-interference effect is discussed using these results. Porous walls are effective for reducing blockage, which change the Mach number around the airfoil. However, high wall porosity causes large downwash, which changes the flow angle. In this paper, Mokry’s method, which is one of the linear wall-interference correction methods, is evaluated quantitatively using computational fluid dynamics. Computational result with wind-tunnel walls are corrected by Mokry’s method, and the corrected result is compared with the one without wind-tunnel walls. Mokry’s method shows high accuracy in subsonic and no-stall conditions, which satisfy the requirement of the small-perturbation potential equation. Its accuracy is also high even if the model is large relative to the wind-tunnel size. However, an error of about 10 drag counts is caused due to a shock wave in transonic flow conditions, and accuracy rapidly degrades around the stall condition, where an error exceeding 100 counts is caused by flow separation.",52,1

The characteristics of the wing and its section (a S8036 profile) were established at . The results indicate that ground effect is highly beneficial in augmenting lift, such that marked increases in the maximum lift-to-drag ratio may be realized. Finite wings in ground effect benefit from a reduction in vortex drag, as well as a lift increase, yielding greater gains in efficiency than achievable for an airfoil. The evaluation of analytic relations for estimation of the finite wing lift-curve slope and drag due to lift showed close accord with experiment.",52,1

Three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed at , , and . Comparisons were made between experimental data and simulation results computed using two Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models (Menter’s shear stress transport and Spalart–Allmaras) and two hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation models (delayed detached-eddy simulation and the dynamic hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation model). All models overpredicted the mean wall static pressures on the suction surface. Wall pressure predictions obtained using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and dynamic hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation models exhibited qualitatively better agreement with experiments than did delayed detached-eddy simulation predictions, and the dynamic hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation model produced the best agreement for the mean streamwise velocity profiles. Turbulent intensity profiles showed substantial mesh sensitivity for the delayed detached-eddy simulation model simulations, whereas the dynamic hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation model results qualitatively compared well with the experiments and exhibited only a small degree of mesh sensitivity. Unique to the dynamic hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation simulations was the accurate prediction of the flow reattachment location. None of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models predicted flow reattachment, and the delayed detached-eddy simulation model predicted a substantially delayed flow reattachment.",52,1

Rotor performance calculations with the comprehensive rotorcraft analysis CAMRAD II are compared with the wind-tunnel test data. The analysis of the McHugh rotor with the Reynolds-number-corrected airfoil table shows good correlation with the measurements for to 0.5 and is able to predict the maximum rotor lift reasonably well, especially at . The analysis is also able to predict the maximum lift of the full-scale UH-60A rotor within about 3.5% at and 0.3. Calculations with dynamic stall models, in general, show only a small influence on the rotor performance and are not necessary to predict maximum lift. Airfoils have an important role in defining the maximum lift capability of the rotor. The VR-12 airfoil, which has stall characteristics superior to the baseline V23010 airfoil, substantially improves the maximum lift capability of the McHugh rotor, showing the potential to improve the behavior of a rotor by improving the airfoil’s static stall characteristics.",52,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032695,"Many current and future aircraft designs rely on the wing or other aircraft surfaces to shield observers on the ground from the engine noise. However, the available data showing how surfaces interact with a jet to shield and/or enhance the jet noise are currently limited. Therefore, far-field noise data and background-oriented schlieren images were acquired for a round jet, operating in the overexpanded, ideally expanded, and underexpanded supersonic flow regimes, near a planar surface to investigate how airframe surfaces might affect the shock-cell structure in the jet plume and the broadband shock noise produced. These data show that broadband shock noise is produced by the relatively weak shocks far downstream of the nozzle exit; consequently, a surface will be effective at reducing broadband shock noise only if it is long enough to shield the noise produced by shocks. Furthermore, the presence of a surface very near the edge of an underexpanded jet increases the shock-cell spacing, pushing the shock cells farther downstream. Conversely, the surface has a minimal affect on the shock cells in an overexpanded jet.",52,1

They can be classified as either continuous or discrete, and they can include nonlinear aircraft performance, atmospheric conditions, wind forecasts, airspace structure, amount of departure fuel, and operational constraints. Moreover, multiple differently characterized flight phases must be considered in flight planning. The flight-planning problem can be regarded as a trajectory optimization problem. A natural way to address a trajectory optimization problem is using optimal control techniques. The multiphase nature of the problem and the nonlinear dynamics of the aircraft lead to the formulation of a multiphase optimal control problem. A Hermite–Simpson collocation method is employed to transcribe the infinite-dimensional optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional optimization one, which is solved using a nonlinear programming solver. An application to the optimal takeoff weight, minimum fuel consumption trajectory planning problem is presented. Aircraft performances, flight procedures, and the resulting fuel consumption are analyzed. The problem is also solved for different takeoff weights and different cost indices. Their effects in the optimal performances are presented and discussed.",52,1

Two-dimensional laminar simulation, two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation using the Baldwin–Lomax turbulence model, and three-dimensional implicit large-eddy simulation are employed in this study. The two-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional implicit large-eddy simulations accurately predict the separation point, and capture the characteristics of a separation bubble for each Reynolds number and each angle of attack. Nonlinearity in the lift curve is also captured in the results of the two-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional implicit large-eddy simulations. The two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation using the Baldwin–Lomax turbulence model predicts the separation point nearer the trailing edge than does the two-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional implicit large-eddy simulations, and the separation bubble is not captured for any Reynolds number and angle of attack by this method. Nonlinearity of the lift curve does not appear in the results of the two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation using the Baldwin–Lomax turbulence model.

The fish-bone-active-camber concept is a high-authority morphing camber architecture with a broad range of applications, including fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, wind turbines, and tidal-stream turbines. The low chordwise bending stiffness of the morphing structure, high stiffness of the tendon drive system, and the large changes in aerodynamic loading while morphing necessitate a coupled fluid/structure-interaction analysis for determination of the static equilibrium. An Euler–Bernoulli beam-theory-based analytical model of the structure is introduced and validated. Aerodynamic loads are found using the XFOIL software, which couples a potential-flow panel method with a viscous boundary-layer solver. Finally, the tendons are modeled as linear stiffness elements whose internal strains are found from the Euler–Bernoulli theory, and whose axial forces create bending moments on the spine at their discrete mounting points. Convergence of the fluid/structure-interaction code is stabilized through incorporation of relaxation parameters. The results for two chosen test cases are presented to give an insight into the mechanical and aerodynamic behavior of the fish-bone-active-camber concept.",52,1
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032726,"As the emphasis on initiatives that can improve environmental efficiency while simultaneously maintaining economic viability has escalated in recent years, attention has turned to more radical concepts of operation. In particular, the cruiser–feeder concept has shown potential for a new generation, environmentally friendly, air-transport system to alleviate the growing pressure on the passenger air-transportation network. However, a full evaluation of realizable benefits is needed to determine how the design and operation of potential feeder-aircraft configurations impact on the feasibility of the overall concept. This paper presents an analysis of a cruiser–feeder concept, in which fuel is transferred between the feeder and the cruiser in an aerial-refueling configuration to extend range while reducing cruiser weight, compared against the effects of escalating existing technology levels while retaining the existing passenger levels. Up to 14% fuel-burn and 12% operating-cost savings can be achieved when compared to a similar technology-level aircraft concept without aerial refueling, representing up to 26% in fuel burn and 25% in total operating cost over the existing operational model at today’s standard fleet technology and performance. However, these potential savings are not uniformly distributed across the network, and the system is highly sensitive to the routes serviced, with reductions in revenue-generation potential observed across the network for aerial-refueling operations due to reductions in passenger revenue.",52,1

In this paper, the ground effect of a sharp leading-edge delta wing with sweep angle of 65 deg is investigated by using ANSYS Fluent employing the unsteady compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and the shear-stress transport turbulence model. The angle of attack is fixed at 20 deg and the flight height is varied from high altitude to close proximity to the ground. The lift, drag, and nose-down moment increase with decreasing flight height, and the major contribution to the variation in aerodynamic forces comes from the windward side of the wing. In ground effect, the pressure under the delta wing increases due to the “ramping” effect, the strength of the leading-edge vortex enhances before breakdown, and the vortex breakdown is promoted due to the increased adverse pressure gradient.",52,1

Because further evolutionary improvements do not appear to be sufficient, envisioning disruptive technologies turn out to be essential to reach the set of future targets. The design of innovative integrated energy–power systems is certainly a major promising element as can be shown by the increasing interest toward hybrid energy and universally electric aircraft. The consideration of these new types of aircraft represents a new challenge for conventional aircraft sizing and performance methods. As an extension of the conventional methods used for fuel-energy aircraft, a sizing and performance methodology for hybrid-energy aircraft is proposed. A design study of a battery and fuel hybrid-energy single-aisle retrofit is conducted to demonstrate the methodology and to analyze the implications of the associated new design variables on the sizing and performance. The benchmark against a conventional reference aircraft shows a potential block fuel-burn reduction up to 16% for a 900 n mile off-design mission stage length (using a mix of fuel energy to electrical energy of ). Clean sheet designs will be part of future work to assess the full potential of hybrid-energy aircraft.",52,1
