0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035699,"The adoption of conventional “black metal” composites in aircraft structures has lead to an improvement in performance over previous metallic designs. With the maturation of automated fiber placement, the design of unconventional composites featuring spatially varying tow orientations has become possible, but it is not yet clear how to utilize this new design freedom optimally. Wing design optimization studies are performed for three different material technologies: aluminum alloy, conventional carbon-fiber-reinforced composite, and tow-steered carbon-fiber-reinforced composite. To explore the design trades of these materials, Pareto fronts for the competing objectives of fuel burn and structural weight are generated through gradient-based optimization. These two objectives serve as surrogates for the direct operating cost and acquisition cost of the aircraft, respectively. All optimized wings took advantage of some amount of passive load alleviation at the high-lift maneuver condition. Although the performance increase of tow-steered composite wings was not as dramatic as the performance increase of conventional composite relative to aluminum, the improvement was still significant. This work provides a methodology that can be used to explore tradeoffs in tow-steered wing designs and could be extended to other structural technologies.",57,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035200,"This paper proposes a new fuel-saving climb procedure by reducing thrust near top of climb. Aircraft usually climb at maximum thrust during the climb phase. However, as revealed in this paper, the maximum thrust during climb is not always optimal considering the fact that the engine fuel efficiency of the maximum thrust is worse than that of the cruise thrust. Potential fuel savings of 40–80 lbs by a large jet airliner can be the result of this different engine thrust, but such savings cannot be fully achieved because of aircraft capability and air traffic control constraints. Therefore, the author proposes a practical fuel-saving climb procedure to satisfy the constraints of current aircraft and air traffic control operation. It is shown that a simple rule ( climb from 6000 ft below the optimal cruise altitude) can save more than half of the potential saving (20–50 lbs) regardless of the initial weight with the same aircraft type. It is also confirmed that the proposed procedure works for other aircraft types.",57,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035659,"A computational investigation of the drag and heat transfer experienced by multiple trailing (following) vehicles in hypersonic flight is presented. Linear arrays of vehicles in flight at Mach 10 are modeled. Results are presented for both parametric two-dimensional cases and for a three-dimensional case. Drag and heat transfer on trailing vehicles in two-dimensional (five vehicle) arrays, for both powered and unpowered configurations, are shown to reduce progressively from leading vehicle to trailing vehicle such that trailing vehicles can experience less than 30% of the drag and heat transfer experienced by the lead vehicle. The three-dimensional study examines pressure drag effects for generic lifting body/wave-rider configurations in a three vehicle array. Drag due to pressure on the trailing vehicle in such an array falls to approximately 20% of that experienced by the lead vehicle for an unpowered case and to less than 20% for the powered case. The drag and heat transfer reductions are due to the developing slip stream resulting from the successive vehicles, with attendant and progressively increasing reductions in local approach Mach numbers, local approach velocities, and surface pressures experienced by trailing vehicles.",57,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035934,"The increased number of daily flights in the last decades has led to the densification of major airports and the proliferation of air traffic delays. The approach phase is inherently complex and labor extensive for flight crews, whose mission is to follow a stabilized approach. Current flight management systems do not provide much help in situations of high energy, where crews apply challenging energy management techniques to land in the destination runway. Go-around procedures shall be initiated as soon as the aircraft is not at the correct energy condition at the stabilization gate, despite the increase of workload this type of operation induces for crews and air traffic controllers. The continuation of a nonstabilized approach may put at peril the safety of flight. This paper presents an algorithm that computes the trajectory that stabilizes the aircraft in the minimum distance, which is also known as the high-energy-limit trajectory. The provision of this trajectory contributes to raising flight crew awareness of the aircraft energy state, and it informs that stabilization is not possible by giving the minimum distance to follow a stabilized approach. Flight simulator results helped to assess the operational concept and improve the representativeness of real flight operations. The calculation of the trajectory on a real-time basis provides flight crews with useful information of the aircraft energy condition, which improves flight safety and may ultimately reduce the number of nonstabilized approaches and go-around procedures.",57,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035748,"A multidisciplinary gradient-based sensitivity-analysis methodology is evaluated for optimization of rotorcraft configurations. The tightly coupled discipline models include physics-based fluid dynamics and rotorcraft comprehensive analysis. A discretely consistent adjoint method accounts for sensitivities of the unsteady flow and unstructured, dynamic, overset grids; whereas sensitivities of structural responses to aerodynamic loads are computed using a complex-variable method. The methodology is applied to optimize the shape of UH-60A Blackhawk helicopter blades for hover and forward-flight conditions. The objective of the multipoint design is to simultaneously increase the rotorcraft figure of merit in hover flight and reduce the rotor power in forward flight. Trimmed loose-coupling solutions for the baseline configuration are used to initiate the tight-coupling multidisciplinary analysis. The target thrust, rolling moment, and pitching moment are enforced as optimization constraints. The optimized configuration improves the optimization metrics at both design points. The improved performance and all constraints are maintained over many revolutions beyond the optimization interval, satisfying the required flight conditions. The computational cost of the optimization cycle is assessed in a high-performance computing environment and found affordable for design of rotorcraft in general level-flight conditions.",57,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035897,"Until electric energy storage systems are ready to allow fully electric aircraft, the combination of combustion engine and electric motor as a hybrid-electric propulsion system seems to be a promising intermediate solution. Consequently, the design space for future aircraft is expanded considerably, as serial hybrid-electric, parallel hybrid-electric, fully electric, and conventional propulsion systems must all be considered. While the best propulsion system depends on a multitude of requirements and considerations, trends can be observed for certain types of aircraft and certain types of missions. This Paper provides insight into some factors that drive a new design toward either conventional or hybrid propulsion systems. General aviation aircraft, regional transport aircraft vertical takeoff and landing air taxis, and unmanned aerial vehicles are chosen as case studies. Typical missions for each class are considered, and the aircraft are analyzed regarding their takeoff mass and primary energy consumption. For these case studies, a high-level approach is chosen, using an initial sizing methodology. Only parallel-hybrid-electric powertrains are taken into account. Aeropropulsive interaction effects are neglected. Results indicate that hybrid-electric propulsion systems should be considered if the propulsion system is sized by short-duration power constraints. However, if the propulsion system is sized by a continuous power requirement, hybrid-electric systems offer hardly any benefit.",57,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035677,"This paper presents the development of a simulation framework, SIMSHOL, which has a predictive capability to inform and support real-world ship–helicopter operating limit trials for a range of helicopter–ship combinations. SIMSHOL is a desktop-based predictive simulation tool that presents an objectively optimized human pilot modeling technique within an integrated pilot–vehicle–environment that represents the helicopter–ship dynamic interface (HSDI). The overall scheme employs a multiloop pursuit “paper” pilot model, a linearized helicopter flight dynamics model with a new enhanced spatial turbulence model, together with an objective optimization loop. To simulate the ship-airwake turbulence effect, a new spatial airwake disturbance modeling technique has been developed, which, in real time, captures the spectral characteristics of the turbulence around the ship from a computational fluid dynamics-computed ship airwake. Time- and frequency-domain comparisons have been made between SIMSHOL and piloted simulation flight trial experiments. It was observed that the performance of the SIMSHOL tool in maintaining sufficient clearance between the aircraft and the ship’s landing deck and hangar, while rejecting airwake disturbances, is well within the desired task performance boundaries. These investigations have shown that the tool is capable of representing the dynamics of a pilot–vehicle–task system in the challenging HSDI environment. Moreover, an automatic error-minimization-based response optimization methodology has been developed and used, which uses the iterative gradient descent optimization algorithm to objectively tune the pilot–vehicle loop transfer functions to represent a pilot’s performance in the simulator. The results show that SIMSHOL is able to predict operational limits for a range of different helicopter–ship and environmental combinations.",57,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035732,"Folding wingtips have begun to feature on recent aircraft designs, as a solution for compliance with existing airport gate width regulations while enabling high-aspect-ratio wings for lower induced drag and better overall fuel efficiency. Recent studies have suggested that by allowing folding of the wingtip during flight, additional gust load alleviation can be achieved. This paper describes the first experimental study of the folding wingtip concept, when applied to a highly flexible, high-aspect-ratio wing. Using a low-speed wind tunnel with a vertical gust generator, the experiment examined the load alleviation performance through a range of one-minus-cosine gust inputs and found up to 11% reduction in peak wing-root bending moment. In addition, a movable secondary aerodynamic surface was fitted to the folding wingtip, which demonstrated that such a device was able to control the orientation of the folding wingtip effectively in steady aerodynamic conditions, as well as achieving further reduction in peak wing-root bending moment during gust encounters through active control.",57,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035864,"This Paper describes a new method of correcting the wind tunnel wall interference of permeable Kevlar test section walls. The classical three-dimensional panel method is extended to flows in a Kevlar-walled test section and modified to improve its general predictability. The results computed using this enhanced panel method are in good agreement with experimental results with regard to the pressure distributions on a wind tunnel model and Kevlar wall surfaces and the Kevlar wall deformation. With this new tool, which can compute flows in a Kevlar-walled wind tunnel precisely, it is possible to compute the disturbance flows due to the walls correctly and separately from those due to the wind tunnel model. The effects of the wind tunnel walls on blockage and downwash of the flow in the wind tunnel are estimated by calculating the disturbance flow velocity due to the walls at the model reference point. Wall interference corrections using this new method are applied to a high-lift semispan wing model installed in a Kevlar-walled test section, and the results demonstrate that the method is practicable and reliable.",57,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035922,"A simple, accurate, reduced-order model is developed for predicting the maximum available thrust performance of subsonic ring-wing propulsors varying in shroud airfoil length, thickness, camber, and/or angle of attack relative to the centerline. The method, applicable to drones, aircraft, ships, and more, identifies the potential upper limit to the thrust augmentation available from hover to cruise, as well as those dominant geometric features contributing to its achievement and those factors limiting its attainment. It employs classic thin airfoil aerodynamic principles and is an extension and enhancement of two previous reduced-order models. Sensitivity studies are conducted of impacts on thrust augmentation from shroud-induced viscous effects, radial loading variations induced by the propeller, and losses due to propeller-induced swirl. The model’s efficacy is assessed using over 40 independently published experimental and state-of-the-art inviscid and viscous computational data sets for more than 20 different configurations. It is shown that the model’s algebraic solutions provide very good engineering estimates at all operating conditions from hover to cruise, thereby enabling rapid preliminary design of ring-wing-based systems. Additionally, the new model provides a means to establish maps of the practical thrust augmentation limits for ring wings, providing rational starting points for formal optimization studies.",57,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035875,"Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites are widely used in aircraft structures due to their excellent mechanical properties, light weight, and corrosion resistance compared to conventional metallic materials. However, the low electrical conductivity in the composite’s thickness direction makes them susceptible to lightning strike damage. An all-polymeric lightning strike protection (LSP) system based on a conductive polymer (polyaniline) adhesive layer has been proposed in recent literature. A preliminary study suggests the polyaniline-based adhesive layer has good electrical conductivity, low density, easy applicability, and corrosion resistance, which make it a strong contender for a next-generation LSP solution. However, being a novel technology with a low technical readiness level, its impact on the aircraft weight, cost, and performance remains unknown. In this work, technology impact forecasting has been deployed for the first time to explore the potential impact of the novel LSP technology in the context of a commercial aircraft system. This work presents a rapid assessment on the feasibility and economic viability of the novel LSP technology, and the results have been compared with the traditional metal mesh and the more widely used expanded metal foil LSP technologies. The results from this study show that, although the parasitic weight of the conductive polymer is lower than that of the metal mesh, the expanded metal foil is still a better option in terms of weight savings. From the economic perspective, the proposed new technology could lead to greater profitability in research, development, testing, and evaluation cost. However, this is compromised by the increased costs in the manufacturing and maintenance of such new material technology.",57,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035882,"Reliable prediction of aircraft poststalled dynamics is entirely dependent on the adequacy of the aerodynamic model. A mathematical model of aerodynamic characteristics of a light aircraft is developed for a wide range of angles of attack, sideslip, and angular rates. It is augmented by a model of uncertainties based on a set of repeated measurements of static aerodynamic characteristics. The effect of aerodynamic uncertainties on steady-state and oscillatory spin modes is directly calculated using a continuation on a parameter technique. The influence of aerodynamic uncertainties on spin entry/recovery is also analyzed.",57,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035736,"It has been shown experimentally that local nonlinear stores attached to the wings of a model airplane enhance overall energy dissipation through global nonlinear modal energy exchanges. Here, a computational model is developed to investigate this effect. The dynamics of the airplane–store system is studied under impulse loading with both stores locked (L-L configuration), left-wing store unlocked (U-L), or both stores unlocked (U-U). Each store acts as a rigid mass when locked, or as a strongly nonlinear element otherwise. The results are in agreement with the experimental ones at different impulse levels. The simulated responses for the U-L and U-U configurations are then projected onto the normal modes of the underlying L-L system to study modal energy redistributions caused by the nonlinear stores. The U-L and U-U configurations exhibit irreversible nonlinear energy transfers from the airplane modes to the stores, with faster decay of total energy compared with the L-L configuration, corroborating the experimental results. The stores also drastically affect the distribution of energy among airplane modes, also contributing to enhanced energy dissipation. Finally, harmonic excitation is considered, and the nonlinear effects are confined to a specific frequency band. This work confirms the drastic dynamic effects that local nonlinear attachments can have on the dynamics of the (linear) structures to which they are attached. Whether such local strong nonlinearities are to be purposely designed to enhance energy dissipation or need to be accounted for to mitigate their possibly detrimental effects is of great practical significance in different applications.",57,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035889,"One specialized application of a force transducer is a wind-tunnel force balance: a device used to measure the forces and moments exerted on a wind-tunnel model when subject to wind flow. In this study, a balance is manufactured from 17-4PH powder using selective laser melting. The performance of the balance is assessed relative to a conventionally manufactured balance. The additively manufactured balance exhibited accuracies and spring quality comparable to the conventionally manufactured balance; however, sensitivities were lower for the additively manufactured balance due to oversizing of almost all flexural members. Taken together, these results suggest that additive manufacturing can be used to manufacture balances for many wind-tunnel applications, which are expected to decrease the manufacturing time of balances by six to nine months and offer the potential to manufacture new balance design geometries.",57,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035766,"In this paper, aiming to drive the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to the optimal position of the vertical plane in the close formation flight, a control method that is based on extended state observer (ESO) and wingtip vortex structure is proposed. This method is suitable for cases where the optimal position is unknown and there are gusts. The scheme is divided into three parts. In the first part, an ESO is designed to estimate the change of the lift and other external disturbances on the follower UAV. In the second part, an algorithm making use of the estimates of the change of the lift to predict the optimal position for the follower UAV is proposed. In the third part, to stabilize the UAV around the optimal position, a sliding mode controller is designed and the external disturbances on the follower UAV are compensated by the ESO. The simulation results show that the followers could automatically adjust their spatial positions to track the predicted optimal positions behind the leader UAV and achieve the precisely close formation flight without the information of leader’s altitude.",57,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035815,"Recent research on flight-deck interval management technology, including the findings of a flight-test demonstration conducted by NASA, led to the development of an alternative control logic for flight-deck interval management, termed as “interval management–speed planning.” As this logic demonstrated promising results in numerical simulations, for the first time, test pilots and airline pilots were invited to evaluate the system in an Airbus A320 simulator, using an avionics setup similar to the one employed in NASA’s flight test, on an approach for the Tokyo International Airport. A qualitative and quantitative survey was conducted in which the pilots’ opinions pertaining to their acceptance of the interval management operation and comprehension of the system behavior using both the original and alternative control logic, as well as a modified graphical user interface, were sought. The results indicated that the new control logic was well accepted by the pilots, confirming some of the results and hypotheses from the numerical simulation; nevertheless, it was indicated that further research on the user interface is needed to make full use of the logic’s capability.",57,5
