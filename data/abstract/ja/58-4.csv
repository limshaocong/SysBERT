It appears that the distributed flow and force sensor arrays found in flying animals are instrumental in enabling this performance. Using a wind-tunnel wing model instrumented with distributed arrays of strain and pressure sensors, we characterized the relationship between the distributed sensor signals and aerodynamic and load-related variables. Estimation approaches based on nonlinear artificial neural networks (ANNs) and linear partial least squares were tested with different combinations of sensor signals. The ANN estimators were accurate and robust, giving good estimates for all variables, even in the stall region when the distributed array pressure and strain signals became unsteady. The linear estimator performed well for load estimates but was less accurate for aerodynamic variables such as angle of attack and airspeed. Future applications based on distributed sensing could include enhanced flight control systems that directly use measurements of aerodynamic states and loads, allowing for increase maneuverability and improved control of unmanned aerial vehicles with high degrees of freedom such as highly flexible or morphing wings.",58,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035959,"In the context of conceptual design there are low-fidelity lifting line models capable of predicting the maximum lift coefficient of trapezoidal twisted wings. However, more complex geometries like that of the blended-wing–body (BWB) require the introduction of additional geometrical hypotheses. This paper introduces a compound-wing lifting line model that predicts the maximum lift coefficient of geometries like the BWB. Such a model would decrease computation times at early design stages for the BWB. The proposed model is calibrated using Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations of a regional BWB geometry near stall with three different twist distributions at low-speed conditions. Application of the calibrated compound wing model on the regional BWB geometry allows to quickly find an optimal twist distribution for this specific configuration: a semiconstant twist distribution on a fraction of the outer wing.",58,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035787,"This paper details the successful takeoff and landing of a wing-tip-connected meta aircraft prototype. The aircraft consisted of two commercial off-the-shelf high wing trainers connected wing tip to wing tip with three neodymium magnets. The flight controller on board each aircraft was a Raspberry Pi 3B complete with Navio2 flight controller. The software running on the aircraft was built using Emlid developer libraries with custom C++ wrappers for the inner-loop control system. The flight control algorithm reads state information and seeks to move the aircraft to a desired attitude depending on pilot inputs. The pilot commands both aircraft, and each flight controller responds independently to these inputs. No communication between aircraft was necessary to ensure stability. Simulation results are included to highlight successful performance of the controller with one aircraft and two connected aircraft.",58,4

Two-dimensional computational studies are carried out to investigate the sensitivity of microjet aerodynamic effectiveness to configuration. Initially, the effects of microjet location and width are explored. The study shows that lift enhancement decreases as the microjet is moved forward from the trailing edge, and that wider microjets are more effective in lift enhancement and drag reduction, whereas thinner microjets are more efficient. Microjet exit velocity profile effect on the integrated forces is also studied, and the effects are shown to be insignificant. To gain preliminary insight of the microjet system requirements, several plenum configurations are studied, and a preliminary analysis of the power requirements to supply the air mass flow is presented. Next, the study is extended to a geometry with moderate trailing edge separation to demonstrate microjet’s separation mitigation capability. To gain better understanding of the system requirements, pulsed versus continuous microjets are examined, and it is found that pulsed blowing causes a breakdown of the favorable effect of the microjet on the trailing edge flow and therefore reduces the circulation control effectiveness of the microjet.",58,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036101,"Air vehicle sizing requires the ability to estimate the propulsive power and energy requirements of a flight vehicle as well as its weight. Existing tools and methods for aircraft sizing typically focus on a specific air vehicle category, generally assume a conventional fuel-burning propulsion system architecture, and employ a point-mass performance model. These shortcomings limit or preclude their applicability to novel concepts that differ from conventional fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft in configuration, employ all-electric or hybrid-electric propulsion systems, transition between different modes of flight, use propulsors in the dual role of control effectors, and/or offset weight in flight with a time-varying combination of aerodynamic lift, buoyant lift, and thrust. This paper demonstrates a methodology whereby flight performance, mission analysis, and energy sizing concepts are generalized and combined with explicit consideration of vehicle trim and geometry parameterization within a vehicle sizing and performance analysis framework intended for novel vehicle configurations and propulsion system architectures. The general applicability of the proposed methodology and developed framework is demonstrated through sizing and performance analyses of three dissimilar vehicle concepts: 1) a conventional twin-engine general aviation aircraft, 2) an all-electric vertical takeoff and landing lift-plus-cruise configuration, and 3) a hybrid lift airship.",58,4

The present paper discusses USM3D analyses that were performed in support of the wind tunnel test. The results consisted of comparisons between USM3D and experimental data for the baseline configuration and two boundary layer thickening configurations. The comparisons considered surface pressure distributions, boundary layer profiles, and calculated boundary layer thicknesses. Additionally, a grid refinement study was performed for each of the three configurations, which illustrated general improvement in the comparisons with increasing grid refinement. Overall, the comparisons show favorable agreement between the USM3D predictions and the experimental data.",58,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036012,"The effect of aircraft performance, quantity, and schedule on aircraft cost has been analyzed in order to create a method for making informed decisions about aircraft optimization. Operations analysis and parametric costing were used to compare the operational value of increased aircraft performance to the cost of increasing aircraft performance. In addition to the direct cost of performance, this analysis includes the hidden costs to the manufacturer and user resulting from a reduction in aircraft quantities delivered due to incremental increases in their unit cost. It is shown that accelerating product development in order to deliver an 80% solution provides the best value to the user and the greatest return to the manufacturer. It is also shown how this analysis can be used to develop a proposal strategy based on a price to win.",58,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036058,"Low technology readiness level (TRL) technologies are attractive to the aerospace industry because their maturation cycles can happen simultaneously with the development lifecycle of the aircraft. However, due to the limited knowledge about a new technology in system evaluation, a low TRL technology’s high potential is counterbalanced by its inherent high risk and high uncertainty. As a result, the assessment of the potential impact of low TRL technologies on a new system is exceedingly difficult. In this paper, a modified technology impact forecasting (TIF) methodology has been proposed that incorporates the novel use of possibility distributions to more accurately quantify the potential of a low TRL technology on a baseline system. The proposed method has been demonstrated through a case study that considers composite self-healing technologies (i.e., microcapsule-based and one-dimensional vascular-based self-healing materials) as a representative low TRL technology, and quantifies the impact of infusing this set of technology onto a notional commercial aircraft system. The results show that, compared with evaluation using a traditional TIF framework, the variability using possibility distributions is significantly reduced for the same system responses. This reduced variability decreases uncertainty, which implies further reduced risk.",58,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035814,"Many electric vertical takeoff and landing concepts are characterized by nontraditional vehicle layouts with distributed propellers. Two propeller interaction types were distinguished in this Paper, which investigates how propeller interaction in side-by-side and one-after-another configuration affects performance, in terms of thrust, power, in-plane forces, and out-of-plane moments, and how those performance effects depend on axial and lateral propeller spacing. A wind-tunnel experiment was performed with two propeller units, one instrumented with a force/torque sensor and the other introducing the aerodynamic interaction. Total pressure and planar particle-image velocimetry measurements were taken to investigate slipstream characteristics. A strong dependency of interaction effects on the geometric layout was found. For side-by-side interaction characteristic of vertical takeoff and transition, interaction effects varied from weak at small angle of attack to strong at larger angles. A drop in rear propeller thrust of up to 30% was found at constant advance ratio. Keeping thrust constant resulted in power penalties up to 13% for the two propellers combined. For one-after-another interaction, characteristic of cruise, a maximum reduction of thrust of up to 80% was observed. Thrust compensation led to power penalties up to 30% for the rear propeller alone. An extended blade element momentum model captured most interaction effects with sufficient accuracy.",58,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035979,"This Paper explores the development of a novel hybrid air vehicle for package delivery called the quadrotor biplane tail-sitter. This vehicle uses differential thrust to effect body attitude changes like a traditional quadrotor, ensuring full transitional control between hover and forward flight modes. This method of control also allows the vehicle to remain mechanically simple. A vehicle was designed with a 1 lb (0.45 kg) payload, resulting in an 8 lb (3.63 kg) gross takeoff weight. The vehicle can hover using 15 in. (0.381 m) diameter proprotors and has two wings that span 3.35 ft (1.03 m), which provide lift in forward flight. Sensors were implemented onboard the vehicle to monitor individual dc brushless motor revolutions per minute, body attitude angles, electrical power consumption, and airspeed relative to wind. Stable hover was demonstrated with package delivery, and it was found that 18% less power was used when hovering with no payload compared to full payload. Package delivery was also successfully demonstrated after transitioning from hover to forward flight and back. In forward flight mode with no payload, the power consumption at a forward flight speed of was seen to be 50% less than the power consumed in hover.",58,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036105,"Accurate modeling of aircraft fuel consumption, emissions, and noise is crucial in evaluating new air transportation operational procedures and policies to abate negative environmental impacts. The Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) is a comprehensive software package developed to address this requirement. Although the modeling of departure operations around airports is of great interest to policy makers and communities, AEDT’s default departure procedures, assumptions of maximum takeoff thrust, and current weight estimations do not fully represent real-world operational flight conditions. With more access to flight data, this paper first presents the development of improved departure profiles that fine-tune the previous modeling assumptions to more accurately reflect real-world operations. We then present a systematic analysis of the new departure profiles through a large-scale computer experiment and follow-up statistical analysis. The result provides comprehensive and valuable insights on the sensitivity of assumptions, quantification of the new profiles’ impacts on estimating aviation environmental impacts, and variability among different aircraft models. Lastly, the statistical learning method elastic net is used to find the driving factors behind the complex patterns observed in the noise results.",58,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036122,"Waveriders have a high lift-to-drag ratio in hypersonic states, while the flexibility of design methods must still be improved because of some deficiencies such as unsatisfactory off-design performance and stability. In this paper, a geometric relationship in the osculating-cone method is derived and expressed by a differential equation set including five equations. Then the equation set is simplified into a nonhomogeneous ordinary differential equation set with two variables using the trigonometric identities. Using numerical methods to solve the differential equation set, the planform of a waverider can be predefined, improving the flexibility of waverider design significantly. Two types of configurations aided with cubic polynomials and discrete points were generated to validate the expression. Some novel configurations, such as double swept and with dihedral wings, can be generated. Irregular solutions are also discussed, suggesting that some irregularity of the inlet capture curve is permitted in the osculating-cone method.",58,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036124,"The Aircraft Noise Simulation Working Group (ANSWr) was established by DLR, ONERA, and NASA to compare simulation tools, establish guidelines for noise prediction, and assess uncertainties associated with the simulation. A benchmark test was initiated, and initial results for a reference and a low-noise vehicle are discussed. The reference aircraft is a conventional tube-and-wing configuration with the engines installed under the wings. The low-noise variant features a high wing design with engines mounted above the wing and fuselage junction. Simulations are performed for both departure and approach conditions, and the results obtained with the different system noise prediction tools are compared. For the reference aircraft, the overall agreement is good among the three predictions. Maximum A-weighted sound pressure levels received on the ground agree within 3–4 dB. For the low-noise vehicle, the comparison of the computed results focuses mainly on the acoustic shielding calculations, as well as on the noise source components. Considering these shielding effects, all three prediction methods show remarkable good agreement, with differences in maximum A-weighted sound pressure level typically lower than 4 dB. In conclusion, the results are quite promising. Despite simulation assumptions made to assist in the comparison, this work is a first and a positive step toward the development of a reliable and comprehensive comparison of these three aircraft noise simulation tools.",58,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035945,"The commercial aircraft development program is generally confronted with huge risks from various aspects. To improve the economic benefits of the aircraft program and increase the competitiveness of aircraft manufacturers, the risk analysis and economic evaluation of the aircraft program are studied in this paper, within which the qualitative risk assessment index system of the aircraft program is introduced and summarized. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation method, the uncertainties of key parameters in the aircraft program value model, such as the decision period, initial demand quantity, volatility, and price inflation, are analyzed. The range of aircraft program value and the probability distribution corresponding to each parameter are calculated, respectively. A statistical analysis of the simulation results is conducted to prove the rationality of the simulation. To obtain different state combinations, the cost and price of the aircraft are seen as risk variables directly, and the expected value and discrete coefficient are calculated to verify the profitability and feasibility of the program. By analyzing the risk assessment and economic evaluation of the aircraft program, the overall trend of the program value can be obtained, and data support for program research can be achieved.",58,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036188,"Icing on three-dimensional lifting surfaces has been shown to produce highly complex flowfields. However, there is a lack of experimental and computational information in the public domain regarding three-dimensional aerodynamics for iced commercial aircraft wing geometries. Recent work completed at NASA Glenn Research Center’s Icing Research Tunnel has developed realistic ice shapes for the leading edge of a 65% scale Common Research Model (CRM65). These ice shapes were then converted into artificial ice shapes that were used in aerodynamic testing at the Wichita State University’s Walter H. Beech Wind Tunnel on an 8.9% scale CRM65. RANS simulations were computed for one large leading-edge ice shape to assess the ability to predict the aerodynamic performance parameters and to better understand the flow physics. In general, RANS reasonably captures the complex “swept stall” flow features, which are dominated by strong spanwise flow and separation line breaks. Despite the flow complexity, the simulations are able to generally predict the chordwise pressure distributions even at high angles of attack. While the coefficients of lift, drag, and moment are more accurately captured at lower angles of attack than higher angles of attack, the agreement with experimental data is quite reasonable given the complexity of the flow around this iced swept wing.",58,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036001,"This research focused on furthering the current understanding of the flowfield inside a cavity under typical flight conditions. The flight envelope included altitudes of up to 40,000 ft and maximum Mach number of 1.28 and included several test points between Mach 0.9 and 1.1, which are challenging to isolate in wind tunnel testing due to tunnel wall interference. The pod was instrumented to collect aeroacoustic pressures and qualitative flowfield imaging for a cavity with a length-to-depth ratio of four. Test missions were flown with several different passive flow control configurations, and their respective effect on acoustic properties and flow patterns were collected. Flow control comprising a rod-in-a-crossflow or a traditional sawtooth spoiler was generally found to reduce sound pressure level, though the extent of effectiveness varied with flight condition. The flow control devices installed at or below the cavity exit plane were found to have little influence. Tuft-based flow visualization complemented the effort, for one example, by demonstrating the outward flow near the cavity lip for the sawtooth spoiler.",58,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036028,"A computational study is conducted on thin flat plates to simulate flows of Reynolds numbers at to provide understanding and guidance for micro air vehicles and other low-Reynolds-number airfoil designs. A synergistic effort between experiments and validated and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools were used as part of this study. The CFD tool used in this study is an established Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solver with a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model and a correlation-based laminar–turbulent boundary-layer transition model. The computational method was validated against experimental data for flat plates under steady and unsteady kinematic conditions. The objective of the study was to understand unsteady characteristics of a thin flat plate undergoing harmonic pitching (no plunging) around the quarter chord under incompressible flow conditions. Pitching amplitudes were limited to 10 deg to ensure there was no effect of dynamic stall. The focus of this study is to characterize unsteady aerodynamics based on reduced frequency, which was varied between 0.005, 0.05, and 0.5. The unsteady condition of 0.05 was compared against experiments, 2-D RANS, and 3-D hybrid RANS/large-eddy simulation formulations. It was observed that the lift characteristics were reasonably well predicted by the CFD tools when compared to experimental observations. At a reduced frequency of , the pitching motion causes an apparent stabilization of vortices resulting in higher oscillatory lift amplitude than the static value. The 3-D RANS better predicted the pitching-moment characteristics compared to the 2-D RANS, attributed to the breakdown of the leading-edge vortex. It was observed that, although thinner flat-plate airfoils have a higher maximum lift coefficient compared to the thicker NACA 0012, they also produce higher instantaneous pitching moment.",58,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035953,"Structural optimization technology, as advanced as it has become, is still not used to fully automate the design of airframe components at a level of analysis detail that would be acceptable for certification by regulatory agencies. It is part of the development of certifiable structures but is still just a part, requiring significant manual labor invested by stress engineers working with empirical and semi-empirical methods for detail analysis periodically along the design path. The Paper presents an attempt to apply an integrated model-based systems engineering philosophy, fully automated, to the process of designing and certifying aircraft structures with a level of detail and scope of modeling that would meet certification requirements. The Paper presents comparisons, not available until now, between the cost and time required by current design methods practiced in industry and required for certification and by an integrated model-based design method in the case of a particular and important aerospace structural system: the engine pylon. Weight and the development costs of the resulting designs are compared. It allows for the first time an examination of the benefits of product weight performance of the integrated model-based approach as well as engineering effort in a highly realistic certification-driven structural design case. The Paper also describes technical modeling and design automation innovations required to build the practical certification level integrated design optimization platform used here.",58,4
