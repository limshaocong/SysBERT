This indicates that the fuselage dynamics could also have an effect on the dynamics of the gear. To study this interaction, a mathematical model of a nose landing gear coupled to a fuselage model with yaw and pitch degrees of freedom is developed. Results obtained by bifurcation analysis show the nature of the interaction between the two systems; in particular, the two-degree-of-freedom fuselage does affect the onset and subsequent severity of nose landing gear shimmy.",53,4

A generalization of these definitions is made, with an emphasis on whether deflections and loads on a local streamwise section or the entire wing is considered. Determining this axis enables a better understanding as to why various aeroelastic tailoring and adaptive stiffness solutions are effective for flutter suppression and gust loads suppression applications. It is demonstrated, using a flexibility matrix approach, that the loading case must be considered in order to be able to accurately determine the flexural axis of a typical wing structure. The methodology is demonstrated using three numerical models: a simple swept wing; an aluminum wing box; and a tow-steered, variable stiffness, composite plate wing. Finally, the sensitivity of the flexural axis is considered, and it is shown that the global flexural axis is much more sensitive to modeling or measurement errors than the local flexural axis.",53,4

These configurations have redundant elevons typically spanning the entire trailing edge of the wing, for which the large areas result in the generation of large hinge moments. To ensure aircraft stability with a reduced static margin, high control surface deflection rates may also be required. The combination of large actuation loads and rates results in significant actuation power requirements, which affect both fuel burn and the sizing of the actuation subsystem. In the early design phases, there is significant uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the actuation power, which may depend on the vehicle’s static margin, the design and designated roles of the redundant control surfaces, actuator design parameters, and the intensity of encountered atmospheric turbulence. The objective of this paper is to present a methodical approach for assessing this uncertainty and relating it to aspects of the vehicle and actuation system design. Doing so will facilitate decision-making in early vehicle design. Following the sizing and optimization of electric actuators to meet the actuation requirements of the N2A-EXTE hybrid wing–body configuration’s control surfaces, the power consumption of these actuators was evaluated in cruise conditions under the following scenarios: 1) varying atmospheric turbulence, 2) varying vehicle center of gravity, 3) varying control surface utilization, and 4) varying actuator design parameters.",53,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033339,"The main purpose of this study is to generate optimal transition trajectories for an aerial tail sitter that uses cross-coupled thrust-vectoring control. A transition maneuver is most challenging for such configurations due to coupling of the forces and moments with instability in the most critical low-speed flight phases. Based on the classical Cauchy method, an improved gradient-based algorithm is developed in a collaborative process in order to find transition trajectories and increase the convergence rate. The cost function is defined in terms of minimum time in transition from hover to cruise and minimum altitude variations from cruise to hover. In addition, physical constraints are modeled via extended penalty functions. The results, including an optimal solution for states and controls, guarantee that the estimated trajectories are feasible, taking into account all imposed constraints. It is shown that the initial cruise speed in the landing phase will greatly affect the altitude variation and transition time when meeting the mission requirements. A sensitivity analysis shows that increasing the thrust-to-weight ratio would increase the efficiency of the transition maneuver in terms of final altitude and transition time. However, increasing this value is not recommended in the aspects of design and development.",53,4

The configurations include a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate, a single-element aeronautical airfoil, a multielement high-lift airfoil and a wing–body configuration. These test cases are selected in order to cover different transition mechanisms in increasingly complex scenarios. The simulations are performed considering the compressible preconditioned Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, which are one of the options offered by the CFD++ finite volume solver. Turbulence closure is achieved with the shear-stress transport model. This turbulence model is augmented by a transition model based on two additional transport equations: one for the intermittency, and another for the momentum-thickness Reynolds number. Flow parameters, such as freestream turbulence intensity and turbulence length scale, or the eddy viscosity ratio, have important effects on transition onset and extension of the transition region. Mesh refinement and dependence are numerical parameters investigated in this work. The dimensionless wall distance has a significant impact in the computational results. The transition model is also very sensitive to the inflow boundary conditions for the turbulence variables, namely, the freestream turbulence intensity and the eddy viscosity ratio. Good agreement with the experimental data is observed.",53,4

Those aerodynamic performance as well as sonic boom performance are investigated by using numerical approaches. The aerodynamic performance is evaluated by inviscid compressible Euler equations using an unstructured mesh finite-volume method, and then the sonic boom performance is evaluated by an augmented Burgers equation. Thanks to the successful interactions of shock waves between the biplane wing as well as the twin-body fuselages, remarkable drag reduction and better sonic boom performance have been realized simultaneously at our design Mach number of 1.7. The superiority of the proposed supersonic transport configuration over conventional configurations is clearly demonstrated.",53,4

Although it is important to use the same configuration when comparing wind-tunnel data obtained at various facilities, this has not yet been performed with an appropriate validation. In this paper, the model deformation effects are estimated from the difference between the computational fluid dynamics results for a designed configuration and that for a deformed configuration considering support systems. Initially, the techniques for the model deformation correction are validated with two sets of National Transonic Facility wind-tunnel data at a Reynolds number of with different dynamic pressures. Then, the validated model deformation corrections are performed on the wind-tunnel data obtained at the Transonic Wind Tunnel, National Transonic Facility, and European Transonic Wind Tunnel. Differences in the drag coefficients among the three sets of wind-tunnel data fall within about 10 drag counts for the model deformation corrections and the Reynolds number corrections applied to the Transonic Wind Tunnel data to align the Reynolds number to .",53,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033252,"A morphing aircraft adapts to different missions by changing the shape of its wing. With the wingspan change or chord length change, the wing skin will change, which requires the design of the variable wing covering to meet the morphing wing. The core of the variable stiff wing-covering design is splitting the wing surface. By solving the problem, the sliding morphing of the stiff skin is achieved. According to the characteristics of the wing surface, this paper gives two stiff wing-covering segmentation algorithms. First, based on the change of airfoil curve that happened before and after the chord length change, the horizontal noninterference segmentation and morphed method of rigid wing skin is proposed. The airfoil curve is divided into pieces, and the definition of the curve similarity evaluation criterion (that is, ) is presented. The horizontal rigid-surface morphing is achieved, depending on the noninterference folding morphing and the airfoil curve length difference. Second, according to the feature of the column side caused by stretching or shortening of the column, a vertical segmentation method (named “petalized”) of the stiff wing covering for the wingspan change is proposed. By means of the segmentation results of the original column side split through the hierarchical structure and the modular concept, the vertical rigid morphing is achieved. In the last step, two experiments validate the horizontal and vertical algorithms of segmentation and morphing, and they make an analysis of the algorithm complexity.",53,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033592,"This study investigates the aerodynamic tradeoffs of a box-wing aircraft configuration using high-fidelity aerodynamic optimization. A total of five optimization studies are conducted, where each study extends the previous one by progressively adding a combination of design variables and constraints. Examples of design variables include wing twist and sectional shape; examples of constraints include trim and stability requirements. In all cases, the objective is to minimize inviscid drag at a prescribed lift and a Mach number of 0.78. Aerodynamic functionals are evaluated based on the discrete solution of the Euler equations, which are tightly coupled with an adjoint methodology incorporating a gradient-based optimizer. For each study, an equivalent conventional tube-and-wing baseline is similarly optimized in order to enable direct comparisons. It is found that the transonic box-wing aircraft considered here, for which the height-to-span ratio is about 0.2, produces up to 43% less induced drag than its conventional counterpart. This larger than expected benefit is attributed to the unique capability of the box wing to redistribute its optimal lift distribution, as it enables trim and other constraints to be satisfied with almost no performance degradation. The impact of nonlinear aerodynamics on the box wing is explored further through a series of subsonic optimization studies.",53,4

Calculated pressure fluctuation spectra are validated using measurements made on the same configuration in a trisonic wind tunnel at Mach numbers of 0.60, 0.80, and 1.47. The simulation results are used to calculate unsteady integrated forces and moments acting on the store. Spectra of the forces and moments, along with correlations calculated for force/moment pairs, reveal that a complex relationship exists between the unsteady integrated forces and the measured resonant cavity modes, as indicated in the cavity wall pressure measurements. The structure of identified cavity resonant tones is examined by visualization of filtered surface pressure fields.",53,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033334,"The wing tip device in this study was to mimic the wing tips of a soaring bird, featuring three smoothly blended elements. Each such multi-element winglet was integrated into a complete wing–tail–body aircraft configuration. The geometry of each of the three elements in the multi-element winglet was defined using 11 parameters, totaling 33 parameters for a complete multi-element winglet geometry. This design methodology used a three-dimensional geometry generation algorithm based on locally analytical smoothly connected surface patches, allowing for the creation of vastly diverse three-dimensional geometries with a minimal number of specified design parameters. A three-dimensional, compressible, turbulent flow, steady-state analysis was performed using a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver on each configuration to obtain the objective function values. Each configuration was analyzed at a freestream Mach number of 0.25 and at an angle of attack of 11 deg to mimic the takeoff conditions of a passenger aircraft. Multi-objective optimization was carried out using modeFRONTIER, using a radial basis function response surface approximation coupled with a genetic algorithm. Maximizing coefficients of the lift and lift-to-drag ratio and minimizing the coefficients of drag and the magnitude of the coefficient of the moment were the four simultaneous objectives. The Pareto-optimized multi-element winglet concept demonstrated superior performance at subsonic and transonic speeds.",53,4

The work begins with the validation of the computational-fluid-dynamics method using a prolate spheroid. The validated method is then employed for the study of the flow around a shape similar to the Airlander 50 airship of Hybrid Air Vehicles Ltd. An overview of the flow around this kind of shape is presented, supported by pressure survey, flow visualization, and transition effects, as function of the Reynolds number. The sensitivity of the transition location to the Reynolds number is also demonstrated, and then the role of each component of the vehicle is analyzed.

12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033627,"A novel method for the in situ repair of subcritical damage in complex composite structures (T-joints) is demonstrated. In situ repair is achieved through the use of embedded microvascular networks within the structure. Once failure occurs, the embedded vascules are ruptured, providing a route for the injection of a repair agent directly into the damage site. The efficacy of these networks at infiltrating damage is assessed for a number of configurations of vascularized T-joints. The effect of vasculature on the mechanical performance of the component is assessed both numerically and experimentally. Two- and three-dimensional thermomechanical finite element analyses are performed to determine the influence of vasculature on thermal residual stresses and joint strength under 90 deg tensile (pulloff) loading. Failure mechanisms observed during 90 deg tensile pulloff testing agree well with the prediction from finite element analyses. In all cases, successful interaction of vascules with the damage is achieved, giving promise for the future applicability of these channels for in situ repair applications. Further optimization is required, but the vascularized deltoid configuration shows considerable promise for future industrial adaptation.",53,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032351,"In this paper, the fault analysis of an aircraft nose landing gear’s emergency lowering was conducted with a cosimulation method. The simulation was aimed at studying the dynamic response characteristics of landing-gear retraction/extension. Moreover, the equations of the mechanical and hydraulic system were derived and analyzed so as to acquire the boundary condition under which the landing-gear emergency lowering could fail. Based on the simulation platform computer aided engineering, a cosimulation model (including a dynamic system and a hydraulic system) was developed, after which, by comparing the simulation results with the data of the ground test and flight test, the model was further verified. Additionally, the nose landing gear could succeed in emergency lowering with the premise that the critical dampings of different flight cases and temperatures were obtained. After that, a feasible scheme of emergency lowering was put forward. The results showed that, at the end of the landing-gear lowering process, the favorable moment saltation produced by the spring force could lag behind the unfavorable moment saltation of the aerodynamic force of the front and back cabin doors, thus resulting in the fault of emergency lowering and locking. Furthermore, when the method of decreasing the damping force was adopted, the landing gear would succeed in emergency lowering only by adjusting the force down to the critical value. However, due to the reduced damping force, the lowering process could be made so fast that there was a great impact load on the landing gear at the end of the trip. The solution laid in using the original damping value in normal extension and the reduced damping value in emergency lowering by a hydraulic selector valve.",53,4

The resulting structural dynamic equations for multifunctional beams are then coupled with a finite-state unsteady aerodynamic formulation, allowing for both energy harvesting and piezoelectric actuation with the nonlinear aeroelastic system. With the development, it is possible to provide an accurate, integral aeroelastic and electromechanical solution of both energy harvesting from and active control for wing vibrations, considering the geometrical nonlinear effects of slender wings. The current paper focuses on modeling the energy harvesting subsystem and exploring its impact on the multifunctional system. Vibrations of a slender multifunctional wing excited by both aeroelastic instability and external wind gusts will be considered as the sources of energy harvesting. All simulations will be completed in the time domain to accurately capture the nonlinear behaviors of the slender multifunctional wing. Based on the time-domain analysis, results of this effort illustrate that the piezoelectric energy harvesting from transient vibrations may provide adequate energy to support onboard sensor operations.

15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033539,"A relatively low-order linear dynamic model is developed for the longitudinal flight-dynamics analysis of a flexible flying-wing research drone, and results are compared to previously published results. The model includes the dynamics of both the rigid-body and elastic degrees of freedom, and the subject vehicle is designed to flutter within its flight envelope. The vehicle of interest is a 12–lb, unmanned flying-wing aircraft with a wingspan of 10 ft. In the modeling, the rigid-body degrees of freedom are defined in terms of motion of a vehicle-fixed coordinate frame, as required for flight-dynamics analysis. As a result, the state variables corresponding to the rigid-body degrees of freedom are identical to those used in modeling a rigid vehicle, and the additional states are associated with the elastic degrees of freedom. Both body-freedom and bending–torsion flutter conditions are indicated by the model, and it is shown that the flutter speeds, frequencies, and genesis modes suggested by this low-order model agree very well with the analytical predictions and flight-test results reported in the literature. The longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle are characterized by a slightly unstable phugoid mode, a well-damped pitch-dominated elastic-short-period mode, and the stable or unstable aeroelastic modes.

Preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions for the far field are derived based on the Weiss–Smith preconditioner and are demonstrated to be more reliable and accurate when coupled with the preconditioned method. A preconditioned Lower-Upper Symmetric Gauss-Seidel implicit time-marching method is modified according to the preconditioned Jacobian matrix. The applications of the current method on both two- and three-dimensional high-lift configurations indicate that the use of the preconditioned spatial and time discrete schemes and the derived preconditioned characteristic boundary conditions is capable of improving the robustness, efficiency, and accuracy of the computational-fluid-dynamics solver for low-Mach-number aerodynamic simulations.",53,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033381,"Optimization of aerodynamic shapes using numerical methods has always been of engineering interest. This paper presents a highly efficient aerodynamic optimization method for hypersonic wings based on local piston theory. The objective of the optimization is to improve the aerodynamic characteristics of original airfoils or wings generated from NACA0012 while satisfying constraints on structure requirements. In the optimization procedure, a genetic algorithm is employed for optimum search, the Hicks–Henne bump function is used for airfoil geometrical modification, and local piston theory is used for unsteady pressure perturbations caused by geometrical modification from the baseline. Because unsteady pressure perturbations at supersonic or hypersonic conditions could be calculated by local piston theory based on initial flowfield results in the optimum searching process, only one steady-state solution without any use of moving or deforming grids is required. Therefore, the optimization method described in this paper is an extremely efficient technique that combines the advantages of steady computational fluid dynamics and the local piston theory and thus has very low computational cost in an optimum search process. Optimization results of airfoils and wings, including single and multipoint optimization for a flat wing without any sweep, and backswept wing, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the aerodynamic optimization method for hypersonic wings.",53,4

Unsteady simulations were performed using the NASA Common Research Model at a low-speed stall condition. The flowfield is characterized by large scale separation and a highly unsteady wake. An embedded high-resolution hexahedron block in the wake region of the grid has been used to improve resolution of the turbulence in unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes and delayed detached eddy simulations. Model deformation occurring in the wind tunnel was incorporated into the computational setup. The computational fluid dynamics predictions match the force and wing pressure measurements from the wind tunnel very well. The mean and fluctuation data from the time-resolved particle image velocimetry measurements in the wake is matched by the delayed detached eddy simulations result, with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes results showing stronger wake dissipation. Wake characteristics in delayed detached eddy simulations and Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes have been compared using pressure spectra.

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033391,"This work provides an overview of the grid quality and resolution effects on the aerodynamic modeling of ram-air parachute canopies. The computational-fluid-dynamics simulations of this work were performed using the Cobalt flow solver, which is a three-dimensional code, but it was run in a two-dimensional mode for canopy sections with open and closed inlets. Previous simulation results of these geometries showed that grid independence is achieved for the closed and open airfoils with grids containing around half a million and 2 million cells, respectively. Previous grids were either hybrid with prismatic layers near the walls or multiblock structured using algebraic grid generators. The results presented in this work show that grid independence of both geometries can be achieved with much coarser grids. These grids, however, were generated with good smoothness, wall orthogonality, and skewness qualities. The results show that the grid quality value is mainly related to the grid smoothness and does not depend on the grid skewness or the wall orthogonality. Although a smooth grid improves the quality value, and therefore the solution convergence, it does not always lead to an accurate solution. For example, the unstructured grids with anisotropic cells near the wall have very good grid quality; however, they have the worst accuracy among all grids considered because of the poor skewness at the walls. The results also showed that, in comparison to the closed inlets, the open geometry solutions are less sensitive to the initial grid spacing and number of constant spacing layers at the outside airfoil walls. Finally, the open inlet solutions do not change with the inside airfoil grid resolution and type.",53,4

The buffet phenomenon is the oscillation of aircraft surface components excited as a result of the interaction between the differential pressures associated with turbulent airflow, aircraft structures, and control surfaces. This paper presents the modeling and simulation of a steady-state one-way and two-way fluid–structure interaction for the tail buffet problem of an F/A−18 fighter. The commercial software ANSYS is used to conduct the simulations. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with four turbulent models are used to model the fluid domain. Simulation results of two nonlinear eddy viscosity turbulence models were compared with those of two linear viscosity turbulence models and the experimental data. The two linear turbulence models are standard linear Wilcox and Spalart–Allmaras. The two nonlinear eddy viscosity models are nonlinear eddy viscosity model and Spalart–Allmaras model with rotation and rotation/curvature corrections. The nonlinear eddy viscosity model is based on the standard linear Wilcox model and uses the formulation of an explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model. The Spalart–Allmaras model with rotation and rotation/curvature corrections turbulence model is the modified Spalart–Allmaras model with a strain-vorticity-based production and curvature treatment. The finite element analysis to model the structural components was conducted by using shell elements. Based on the simulation results, it is concluded that the buffet problem could be simulated as a two-way fluid–structure interaction and by using the nonlinear eddy viscosity model turbulence model as those give better results than the other considered models.",53,4

The effectiveness of the microflap is examined using a comprehensive rotorcraft simulation code. The aerodynamic properties of the microflap are modeled using a nonlinear computational-fluid-dynamics-based reduced-order aerodynamic model that takes into account unsteadiness, compressibility, and time-varying freestream effects. Active control studies are conducted on a hingeless rotor configuration resembling the Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm BO-105, using various spanwise microflap configurations, including single, dual, and segmented five-microflap configurations. Results indicate that the microflap is capable of substantial reductions in blade–vortex interaction noise ranging from 3 to 6 dB. Vibration reduction ranging from 70 to 90% is also demonstrated. The effect of vibration reduction on noise and vice versa is also examined, and it was found that reduction in one objective is accompanied by an increase in the other, a trend also observed when using other active control approaches. Finally, the microflap is considered for combined vibration reduction and performance enhancement at a high-speed cruise flight condition.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033621,"The present study is in response to increased interest towards assessing the feasibility of a small-scale autonomous helicopter (gross weight less than 1 kg) for Martian exploration. An autonomous rotorcraft may be ideally suited for such an application because of its unique advantages, which include the ability to take off/land vertically on harsh terrain, and greater speed, range, and field of view, when compared to a traditional surface rover. The atmospheric conditions on Mars present a unique set of design challenges. Even though the Martian gravity is only about 38% of Earth’s gravity, the Martian average atmospheric density is about 70 times lower than Earth’s atmospheric density. Therefore, the rotors would be operating at extremely low Reynolds numbers, even lower than 5000 for a small-scale helicopter. However, the Mach number will be significantly higher because of the higher tip speed required (due to lower density) and because of the fact that the speed of sound on Mars is only about 72% of the speed of sound on Earth. This low-Reynolds-number, high-Mach-number flow condition on the blade imposes severe constraints on the rotor design. The solution proposed in the present study involves scaling up the rotor size to produce the required thrust at acceptable Mach and Reynolds numbers. The hover performance of a full-scale rotor for a 200 g Martian coaxial helicopter was experimentally evaluated in an evacuation chamber, where the exact Martian air density was simulated. The maximum figure of merit obtained for the baseline rotor was less than 0.4 at an operating Reynolds number of 3300 and Mach number of 0.34. Increasing the Reynolds number at a constant Mach number by changing the air density increased the figure of merit of the same rotor to over 0.6 at a Reynolds number of 35,000. As the Reynolds numbers was decreased to ultralow values , the blade collective pitch angle for maximum figure of merit increased even up to 30 deg. A key conclusion from this study is the feasibility of small-scale hovering flight on Mars with a realistic endurance (12–13 min).",53,4
