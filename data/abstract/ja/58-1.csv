0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035746,"This paper presents an investigation of the effects of tip sweep on highly twisted composite rotor blades by acquiring strain data in vacuum. Three parametric test cases were designed for strain measurements, and predictions from a special three-dimensional (3-D) finite element method were used for assessment of data. A set of rotating aluminum beams was also tested as a rudimentary baseline. Three sets of composite rotors (straight, twisted, and twisted–swept) were fabricated and tested, and blade properties carefully characterized. Prediction of 3-D strains was conducted using X3D, a 3-D multibody structural dynamic solver for rotor aeroelasticity. Comparison with measured strains showed overall satisfactory agreements. Under centrifugal loading, strong 3-D strain patterns were observed near the twisted–swept tip. The largest increase in strain magnitude is found to be caused by the twist. Evidence of strong lead-lag bending concentrations due to counteracting axial extension and localized in-plane shear were found in the twisted–swept tip.",58,1
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035823,"The aerodynamic data of winged and lifting space vehicles are considered. Recently, there was an investigation with respect to the longitudinal aerodynamics of these vehicles in the supersonic and hypersonic Mach number regimes with the astonishing result that for the lift and drag coefficients a similarity with regard to the geometrical configuration could be observed. It was shown that by introducing a homogenizing reference area with which the related quantities were made dimensionless, fully similar solutions of the lift coefficient and partly similar solutions of the drag coefficients are achieved. In the present paper this investigation is extended to the pitching moment coefficient. Further a generalized fit equation on the basis of exponential functions is constructed, which is able to approximate all the longitudinal aerodynamic coefficients for the supersonic and hypersonic Mach numbers. Finally the potential of these findings are demonstrated by some examples.",58,1
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035739,"The hinge clearance and rotation axis deviation of aircraft landing-gear retraction mechanism are unavoidable due to factors, such as manufacture, assembly, wear, and wing deformation. Such negative factors affect the dynamic response of the mechanism itself, which is more serious for spatial mechanisms. To study this effect, both numerical and experimental investigations on a spatial landing-gear mechanism are carried out in this study. To build the numerical model, the nonlinear contact force model and modified Coulomb friction model are adopted in the hinge clearance of the landing-gear mechanism. Considering the flexibility effect, some key moving parts, such as sidestay links, are flexibly processed to deal with the axis deviation problems. Based on the proposed model, the influences of clearance size and axis deviation value on the dynamic behaviors of spatial landing-gear mechanism are studied. Both the test and simulation results indicate that the clearance and axis deviation have little effect on the actuation response of the retraction mechanism if they are within reasonable ranges. Nevertheless, the axis deviation is greatly influential to the load on structure and the friction in hinge, whereas the clearance mitigates the adverse effects on the motion of mechanism caused by the axis deviation to some extent.",58,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035684,"This work presents the aeromechanics analysis and evaluation of an ultralight counter-rotating coaxial rotorcraft using a combined numerical and experimental approach with a focus on turn, climb, and descent flight conditions. The helicopter features a 2-by-2 bladed coaxial rotor system with teeter hinges, 6.5 m in diameter and uniform airfoil sections of the linearly twisted blades. Hover and forward-flight test data are shown with varying turn rates or climb and descent velocities. The predictive capabilities of a CAMRAD II numerical model are used to extend and support the flight test data and evaluate possible flight-envelope limitations in terms of ceiling limits and maximum climb rates. The paper focuses on rotor performance, thrust, horizontal-stabilizer loads, and blade-tip clearance, with special attention on the effects from interactional rotor aerodynamics. Results in terms of rotor performance, rotor thrust, horizontal-stabilizer loads, and rotorcraft aerodynamic angles of attack resulted in satisfactory correlation between the numerical model and the measurements. Rotor–rotor interactional effects contributed to the approaching rotor-blade tips, especially during low-speed descent flights. During turn flight, required rotor power increases with greater bank angles. Maximum axial climb rate of the ultralight coaxial helicopter was at , the hover ceiling at 2180 m, and the service ceiling at 4450 m. Ceiling limitations depended on the operating conditions and reduced with greater temperature and rotorcraft weight.",58,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035678,"A key challenge in the design of hybrid-electric propulsion systems (HEPSs) for aircraft is the complexity involved in handling efficient sizing of the components as well as control synergy between multiple power sources. To handle this challenge effectively, combined optimal design and control (codesign) methods that enable the integration of energy management optimization along with vehicle sizing are required. Even though some studies have explored such methods, they have done so in a computationally intensive nested formulation with limited depth on the design and control modeling aspect. This paper addresses these issues by posing the system codesign problem using a simultaneous formulation of multidisciplinary dynamic system design optimization (MDSDO). The simultaneous formulation generally facilitates superior computational performance while the MDSDO method solves codesign problems from a more balanced perspective between design- and control-related variables. This method is applied in this paper to aircraft HEPS design with an objective of determining the optimal propulsion component designs and supervisory control strategy that minimizes total energy consumption. The hybrid configuration is compared with its conventional counterpart on the basis of system efficiency. In addition to that, a parametric study on the battery energy density is presented to explore the near-term viability of HEPS for aircraft.",58,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035917,"In this Paper, the integrated propeller–wing system design space is investigated to gain insight into the influence of propeller diameter, location, and rotation direction. To conduct this investigation, a methodology is developed that uses the propeller power required during steady-level flight as a metric for efficiency. Full mutual interaction between the propeller and wing are taken into account in the aerodynamic analysis. To ensure that the propeller is not operating off design, it is designed within an iterative trim loop. This approach is then used to investigate the theory that an inboard-up rotating propeller located at the wing tip is the most aerodynamically efficient configuration through the use of a test case. When considering the trimmed propeller power required, the trends for this case indicate that the optimal propeller for this planform is not an inboard-up rotating propeller at the wing tip, but instead is an inboard-down rotating propeller near the root of the wing.",58,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035727,"This paper conducts improved delayed detached eddy simulation (IDDES) to numerically investigate the performance of a three-dimensional (3D) aircraft control surface using coflow jet (CFJ) active flow control. For the numerical validation with the baseline control surface that has a large flow separation, the predicted lift coefficient and drag coefficient achieve a very good agreement with the experiment, and the maximum discrepancy is less than 3.8%. For the 3D CFJ control surface, a small momentum coefficient of 0.025 generates a 28% of increase at 0° sideslip angle with the flow separation removed. At the same time, a higher corrected aerodynamic efficiency than the baseline is obtained. With of 0.26, the CFJ control surface has its increased by 99.25% and the dropped by 52%. A phenomenon not observed in a regular CFJ wing without flap is that the second suction peak at the flap shoulder is higher than the leading-edge suction peak due to the attached flow with a sharp turning. The CFJ control surface can also sustain a substantially higher stall sideslip angle and flap deflection angle. In conclusion, the 3D control surface using CFJ active flow control is demonstrated by numerical simulation that it can substantially increase the control authority at low energy expenditure.",58,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035745,"An experimental remotely piloted aircraft named X-HALE was designed and built at the University of Michigan to collect experimental data for the flight dynamics of vehicles with very flexible wings. Similar aircraft with a wing span of 4 and 6  m were later developed and built at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology, Brazil, to study the flight dynamics and control of highly flexible aircraft. In the present Paper, the steady structural response of the wing of the X-HALE is investigated by the finite element method assuming 1) linear behavior (small displacement, small strain analysis) and 2) nonlinear behavior (large displacement, small strain analysis). This Paper aims to investigate the influence of geometric nonlinearities in the numerical prediction of load distribution and displacements along the wing span when compared with linear analyses results. For this purpose, four versions of the X-HALE with different structural layouts are presented. Two aircraft have a 4 m wing span constructed with fiberglass and aluminum, respectively. The other two have a wing span of 6 m and were also constructed with fiberglass and aluminum. Internal force redistributions were observed in the nonlinear structural analyses. The redistribution of these forces caused the twist angle to increase and the bending angle to decrease compared to the linear analyses when under the same loading conditions.",58,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035940,"This paper studies the influence of flared-hinge folding wingtips on the aerodynamic derivatives and flight dynamics of a narrow-body transport aircraft. In addition, the influence of fold angle, hinge-line angle (flare angle), and wingtip size on wing loading is assessed. The Tornado vortex lattice method is used for aerodynamic predictions and to estimate the stability and control derivatives. First, the aircraft is assumed rigid, and different hinge angles, fold angles, and wingtip sizes are considered. Then, structural flexibility is considered by coupling Tornado with a linear structural finite element solver to facilitate quasi-static aeroelastic analysis. The quasi-static deflections method is used to study the flight dynamics of the flexible aircraft. The effect of the flared-hinge folding wingtips on the longitudinal and lateral-directional flight dynamic modes of the rigid and the flexible aircraft is compared and contrasted. Furthermore, the variations of longitudinal trim settings and roll response with flared-hinge folding wingtips are assessed.",58,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035824,"The modeling of different problems in aeroelasticity requires a time-domain equation of motion, especially to design modern controllers and study nonlinear characteristics. Typically, unsteady aerodynamic forces are written in the (reduced) frequency domain and then rewritten using rational function approximations in the time domain. In this context, this Paper presents an investigation of this topic including a literature review of the Least Square method used to obtain the time-domain aeroelastic system. It discusses the physical meanings of the augmented aerodynamics states due to the lag terms. It proposes an approach to use a phase error-based index to measure the rational function approximations accuracy depending on the number of lag terms. The proposal allows the analyst to determine the number of lag parameters to establish a time-domain aeroelastic model of a specified accuracy.",58,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035852,"Air traffic controller workload is considered to be a limiting factor for further air traffic growth. To reduce workload, increased automation levels and novel decision-support tools are being investigated. This Paper describes the adaptation and evaluation of a previously developed interface, called the Solution Space Diagram, in a route merging task. It portrays both constrained and unconstrained speed and heading combinations and enables the controller, by means of direct manipulation, to safely vector aircraft. The authors hypothesized that this interface enables controllers to use it in their own preferred way, supporting their skills and strategies, reducing their workload. A preliminary experiment was conducted in which 12 participants, grouped according to expertise level, controlled a sector and were faced with different levels of traffic in a route merging task. Results show that the interface aids in finding merging solutions faster; a significant reduction in the number of commands and in perceived workload was observed. The participants changed their strategy to perform less vectoring and issue route interceptions at an earlier stage, without affecting aircraft separation. These changes were also observed with the professional controllers, although they showed to be more conservative to the use of the diagram. This Paper justifies experimentation with a larger number of participants and in a setup of higher operational realism.",58,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035687,"By using a computational-fluid-dynamics-based numerical virtual flight (NVF) simulator, a simplified quasi-Cobra maneuver of a typical third-generation fighter is simulated and the unsteady aerodynamics, such as the dynamic forces and moments and the flow separation, are analyzed preliminarily. The NVF simulator integrates an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solver on dynamic unstructured/hybrid grids, a rigid-body dynamics solver, and user-defined flight control system. To analyze the complex multiphysics coupling problem, four cases with increasing complexity are studied, including 1) static state simulation; 2) one-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) forced pitchup; 3) 1-DOF pitchup by open-loop control of the elevators; and 4) three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) quasi-Cobra maneuvering. By applying a cosine function open-loop flight control law to the elevators and introducing a simplified vector thrust model, the fighter can pitch up to a high angle of attack from the cruising state, and then it can pitch down quickly, the whole process is similar to a Cobra maneuver. Even though the RANS simulations are not necessarily highly accurate for the large angle of attack, the multidisciplinary application in this work demonstrates the potential of the NVF simulator for the simulations of realistic poststall maneuvers.",58,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035900,"In forward flight, slowing down a rotor alleviates compressibility effects on the advancing side blade tip, extending the cruise speed limit, and inducing high-advance-ratio flight regime. Previous wind tunnel tests have shown that an articulated rotor trimmed to zero hub moment generates limited thrust at high advance ratios, because the advancing side needs to be trimmed against the retreating side with significant reverse flow, where the rotor is ineffective in generating thrust. A rigid hingeless rotor with lift offset may help overcoming this problem. A series of wind tunnel tests were conducted to investigate the behavior of slowed hingeless rotors at high advance ratios. Performance, control angles, hub vibratory loads, and blade structural loads were measured and compared with comprehensive analysis predictions. The results demonstrate that a hingeless rotor with lift offset is more efficient in generating thrust and exhibits higher lift-to-drag ratio at high advance ratios. The blade structural load level is significantly higher compared with an articulated rotor, especially its flap bending moment, which can pose a critical structural constraint on the rotor.",58,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035898,"The present Paper investigates the ditching characteristics of a helicopter model by means of an in-house-developed smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics solver coupled with a six degree-of-freedom motion equation. Verification and validation have confirmed the feasibility and accuracy of the developed solver in predicting hydrodynamic problems. In view of the inherent importance, the effect of initial pitching angle of helicopter was comprehensively considered. Numerical results show that the helicopter experiences a subsequent nose-up and nosedown motion for all the positive initial pitching angles during ditching which is caused by the hydrodynamic overpressure and suction effects. The initial pitching angle significantly affects the helicopter ditching characteristics in terms of load and pressure distribution. For the specific configuration of the helicopter, ditching with initial pitching angle at 6 or 8 deg endures relative lower hydrodynamic load in both horizontal and vertical directions, which can be regarded as preferable setups for a controllable ditching event.",58,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C036026,"In recent years, multilayered hierarchical compositions of the well-known and widely used Gaussian process models called deep Gaussian processes are finding use in the approximation of black-box functions. In this paper, the performance of deep Gaussian process models is empirically evaluated and compared against the well-established Gaussian process models with a special emphasis on engineering problems. The work draws conclusions through detailed comparisons in terms of metrics such as computational training cost, data requirement, predictive error, and robustness to the choice of the initial design of experiments. Additionally, the viability and robustness of deep Gaussian process models for applications on practical engineering problems are analyzed through sensitivity to hyperparameters and scalability with respect to the input space dimensionality, respectively. Finally, the models are also compared in an adaptive construction setting, where they are built sequentially by selecting points that maximize posterior variance. Experiments are conducted on canonical test functions with varying input dimensions, an engineering test function, and a practical transonic airfoil test case with a high-dimensional input space. The experiments suggest that deep Gaussian process models outperform traditional Gaussian process models in terms of accuracy at the cost of incurring a significantly higher computational expense for the training procedure. The sensitivity studies indicate that inducing points is the most important hyperparameter that affects deep Gaussian process performance and training time. This work empirically shows that deep Gaussian processes are promising candidates for problems that are known to be nonlinear and high-dimensional, and when limited training data are available.",58,1
