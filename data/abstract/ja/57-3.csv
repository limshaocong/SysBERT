The major bottleneck here is the time-consuming evaluations of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model used to capture the nonlinear physics involved in designing aerodynamic surfaces. This, in conjunction with a large number of simulations necessary to yield a set of designs representing the best possible tradeoffs between conflicting objectives (referred to as a Pareto front), makes CFD-driven MOO very challenging. This paper presents a computationally efficient methodology aimed at expediting the MOO process for aerodynamic design problems. The extreme points of the Pareto front are obtained quickly using single-objective optimizations. Starting from these extreme points, identification of an initial set of Pareto-optimal designs is carried out using a sequential domain patching algorithm. Refinement of the Pareto front, originally obtained at the level of the low-fidelity CFD model, is carried out using local response surface approximations and adaptive corrections. The proposed algorithm is validated using a few multi-objective analytical problems and an aerodynamic problem involving MOO of two-dimensional transonic airfoil shapes where the figures of interest are the drag and pitching moment coefficients. A multifidelity model is constructed using CFD model and control points parameterizing the shape of the airfoil. The results demonstrate that an entire or a part of the Pareto front can be obtained at a low cost when considering up to eight design variables.",57,3

However, it is difficult to accurately analyze the causes of differences between flight test data and ground test data because there is larger scatter in static aerodynamic data from flight tests compared with those from computational fluid dynamics and wind-tunnel testing. One reason for this is that flight conditions and measurements change according to the flight environment, leading to the data having a multimodal distribution. In this study, monophasic data extracted from flight test data are examined, using a cluster analysis to obtain data with small scatter. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the dataset for several parameters obtained in flight testing in order to consider changes in multiple variables. The results show that proper categorization was possible for cases with large changes during measurement, providing monophasic data with drag coefficient variation of approximately 15–20 drag counts and demonstrating the utility of cluster analysis.",57,3

The overall performance improvement is measured by the net weight saving relative to the maximum takeoff weight . A BWB model based on the reference shape of the Boeing second-generation BWB model is taken as the baseline model. Taking the elliptic and triangular spanwise loading as the two extreme distributions, models with varying spanwise loadings have been designed. High-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions coupled with an inverse design optimization code considering static aeroelasticity is used in the inverse design process. For the BWB models, shifting the spanwise load from the elliptic design toward the triangular design shows a significant reduction in wing root bending moment compared with the traditional civil transports, thus resulting in significant structural weight savings. A wing root bending moment relief of 19% is obtained for the averaged elliptic–triangular design relative to the elliptic design, whereas the loss in aerodynamic efficiency is only 4.4%. The combined effects result in a net weight saving between 0.63 and 1.86% of .",57,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035470,"With the expected growth in demand for commercial aviation and the consequent rise in number of flight operations, there are major concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of such growth, especially with regard to fuel burn, jet emissions, and airport noise levels. Regulatory bodies have been striving to drastically limit such impact by outlining aggressive environmental goals for the aviation industry to abide by. This study focuses on the potential fuel burn reductions from vehicle technologies and operational improvements to achieve those system-level goals. Moreover, the interdependencies between both technological and operational solutions are investigated. Results show that vehicle technologies are essential to achieve the long-term environmental goals with operational improvements providing immediate benefits in the short-term. Furthermore, it is shown that, for some combinations of technological and operational solutions, interdependencies are significant and could be positively exploited to achieve additional fuel burn reductions.",57,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035577,"This paper proposes a method of integration of internal and external flow called the dual waverider. A three-dimensional shock structure is designed to simultaneously satisfy the theories of internal and external waveriders. By using the infinite radius of curvature and omnidirectional center of curvature of a planar shock wave, external flows are made to transition smoothly to internal flows in the cross section. Moreover, a compression efficiency factor (CEF) is proposed to integrate internal and external flows in sections along the flow. Different values of the CEF represent internal/planar/external flows. An integration methodology for the dual waverider is then proposed by combining the two flows. By using this design, various structures of the dual waverider are obtained for different conditions. The theory of the dual waverider is also improved to develop one with double internal passages. Three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed on different configurations of the dual waverider to verify the correctness of the proposed design. The results showed good agreement with those obtained during the design process. Research on the aerodynamic characteristics of the configuration indicates that the dual waverider can integrate internal and external flows and can maintain a high lift-to-drag ratio.",57,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035664,This study establishes a method to overcome the choked-flow and flow-hysteresis problems of the Busemann biplane at offdesign conditions during its acceleration and deceleration processes. Two-dimensional analyses of Busemann-type biplanes have been addressed using the application of a computational fluid dynamics code in both inviscid and viscous flow modes. The effect of stagger on the aerodynamic characteristics of the Busemann biplane is validated. The biplane with the continuous stagger approach shows a lower drag coefficient during the acceleration process as compared with the baseline Busemann biplane and the diamond airfoil. The results also show that this strategy is efficient to reduce the choked-flow and flow-hysteresis problems for the biplane configuration at the offdesign condition.,57,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035629,"The tandem rotor/ground-obstacle interference problems that occur during landing operations produce high pilot workloads. In this study, a vortex-based aerodynamic solver is employed to investigate the flowfields and air loads of a tandem rotor near ground obstacles. The unsteady air loads of the multirotors are simulated using a panel method, and the wake of the tandem rotor is modeled by a vortex particle method. A viscous boundary model accounts for the effects of surrounding obstacles. The method is applied to a th-scaled model of a CH-47D operating near the ground, and the results are compared with those from experiments. The rotor-induced inflow predicted by the numerical model compares reasonably well with the experimental data. Contrary to a tandem rotor operating without obstacles, the rotor wake is deflected by the ground and the obstacle, generating recirculation. As opposed to single forward and aft rotors, the aerodynamic interactions of tandem rotors reduce the lift in the rotor-overlapped region, changing the strength of the recirculation near the ground and obstacles. The starboard side experiences stronger recirculation and a greater decrease in tandem rotor thrust because the rotational directions of the tandem rotor yield a stronger outwash on the starboard side.",57,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035646,"A reduced-order modeling method capable of providing computationally efficient predictions of the nonlinear, unsteady aerodynamics encountered by flexible flight vehicles is presented. Models are developed using the indicial response theory, which characterizes a vehicle’s dynamics through identification of time-accurate aerodynamic responses due to step changes in vehicle-state motion parameters. A coupled computational fluid dynamics aeroelastic analysis is proposed for identifying flexible vehicle step responses. In this approach, aeroelastic indicial responses are simulated via prescribed rigid-body motions, whereas fluid–structure interactions are captured at the subiterative level through coupling to a modal structural solver. A nonlinear extension of the indicial response theory is applied through time-dependent interpolation of a database of locally linear aeroelastic step responses as a function of angle of attack. Reduced-order models are created using the mathematical principle of convolution to predict the time-dependent aerodynamics of a flexible vehicle subject to arbitrary prescribed trajectories. The NASA FUN3D computational fluid dynamics solver is used for simulating trajectories and indicial response functions. Aerodynamic predictions were generated for the flexible X-56A aircraft undergoing a series of forced oscillations. The reduced-order modeling solutions are shown to provide a practical option for evaluating the unsteady aerodynamics of flexible vehicles using high-fidelity simulations.",57,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035496,"The objective of this work was to develop a multifidelity uncertainty quantification approach for efficient analysis of a commercial supersonic transport concept. An approach based on point-collocation, nonintrusive polynomial chaos was formulated in which a low-fidelity model could be corrected using multiple higher-fidelity models. The formulation and methodology also allows for the addition of uncertainty sources not present in the lower-fidelity models. To demonstrate the applicability and potential computational savings of the multifidelity polynomial chaos approach, two model problems were explored. The first was a supersonic airfoil with three levels of modeling fidelity, each capturing a gradual increase in modeling of the underlying flow physics. As much as 50% computational cost reduction was observed using the multifidelity approach, while predicting nearly the same amount of uncertainty in drag. The second problem was a commercial supersonic transport. This model had three levels of fidelity that included two different modeling approaches and the addition of physics between the fidelity levels. Results of this analysis yielded nearly a 70% computational savings to predict a comparable amount of uncertainty in ground noise. Both problems illustrate the applicability and significant computational savings of the multifidelity method for efficient and accurate uncertainty quantification.",57,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035366,"A novel aeroelastic reduced order model is developed for two-dimensional gust interaction modeling in transonic flows. Such conditions exhibit a key nonlinearity: sonic shock motion. The proposed approach comprises an aerodynamics reduced order model coupled to a structural model. The aerodynamics model consists of corrected integrated force coefficients computed by an unsteady potential flow method (incompressible vortex panels). The corrections are obtained from kriging surrogates trained using inviscid compressible computational fluid dynamics data. Two gust lengths (namely, long and short) are simulated for this purpose and serve as the upper and lower bounds of the model. The developed aeroelastic reduced order model is evaluated via modeling untried gust cases, the lengths of which fall between the training cases. Applied to the FFAST Crank and NACA0012 airfoils, the approach accurately reproduces aeroelastic response—with deviations never exceeding 8.0 and 10.5%, respectively. In terms of computational cost, the trained models were more than an order of magnitude faster than the computational fluid dynamics simulations.",57,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035655,"The noise emissions of a full-scale nose landing gear (NLG), measured in a wind tunnel and obtained from computational simulations, are compared with those of three regional aircraft types recorded in flyover measurements. A comparison is made with the noise prediction models of Fink, Guo, and German Aerospace Center (DLR). A good agreement was found between all the spectra. The noise emissions up to 1.2 kHz were found to scale with the sixth power of the flow velocity, as usual; however, the spectra at higher frequencies collapsed better when scaled to the seventh power, confirming the fact that high-frequency noise is radiated from the turbulent flow surrounding small features of the NLG. Microphone arrays showed that the main noise sources were located in the middle of the wheel axle. For the flyovers and computational simulations, strong tonal peaks (at around 2200 Hz) were found, which are likely to be caused by open cavities in the NLG. This phenomenon is not accounted for in prediction models. Removing these tones would result in noise reductions of up to 2 dB. Thus, it is highly recommended to include cavity-noise estimations in the current prediction models, or to simply eliminate such cavities where possible with the use of cavity caps.",57,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035643,"In the present work, unsteady effects present in a ship airwake are further analyzed. The effort is performed in the context of simulation of helicopter launch and recovery operations under a realistic atmospheric inflow. A ship airwake is formed as a combination of the natural wind speed and ship motion, and the incoming flow is turbulent due to the presence of an atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). On a helicopter–ship dynamic interface simulation, accounting for the effects of an ABL can be important. ABLs are different from typical engineering boundary layers, such as one over a flat plate. Although in a time-averaged sense such boundary layers are comparable, real ABLs contain important unsteady features that set them apart. This work separates and quantifies effects inherently due to the unsteady atmosphere, and effects due to a sheared profile without atmospheric turbulence. Two cases are compared: 1) a realistic time-resolved ABL and 2) a steady sheared velocity profile. Using a frequency-domain analysis of the control input sticks, it was observed that the energy increase in an unsteady ABL is higher than the increase found under a steady sheared ABL, suggesting a degradation in controller performance under realistic atmospheric inflow and resulting possibly in an increase in pilot workload.",57,3
