0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C000320,"This paper presents an experimental investigation of the spanwise flow development on an impulsively started rotating rectangular wing at 45 deg angle of attack. Reynolds numbers of 500 and 15,000 were studied, which correspond to insect and flapping-wing micro-air-vehicle scales, respectively. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry flowfield measurements were taken at various spanwise locations and sweep angles (angle of rotation from start) on a motor-driven rectangular wing immersed in a seeded water tank. At both Reynolds numbers, the development of the flow was characterized by the formation of strong positive (root-to-tip) and negative (tip-to-root) spanwise flows, which lost strength toward the tip and root, respectively. The negative spanwise flow appeared to be created by the tip vortex, which accelerated fluid from beyond the tip to the root and turned a portion of the positive spanwise flow back on itself, inducing a secondary vortex inboard of the tip vortex and rotating in the opposite sense. Peak positive and negative spanwise flows in both cases were on the order of the wingtip speed. The extent of negative spanwise flow formation on rectangular wings versus tapered wings, as observed in other studies, suggests that perhaps the formation of negative spanwise flow is dependent on wing geometry and the size of the tip vortex.",50,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031441,"This study describes an experimental study on dynamic characteristics improvement of a helicopter hingeless rotor system in the viewpoint of aeroelastic stability improvement and low vibration. To do this work, a baseline hingeless hub system and blade were developed. For the study of aeroelastic stability improvement, a baseline hingeless hub system was developed and composite materials have been applied to improve the aeroelastic stability and to reduce the weight of the rotor hub system. For the study of a low-vibration blade, a baseline rotor blade was developed and composite materials have been applied to a well-tailored design focused on optimization of the blade sectional property distribution. In this experimental study, some parts of a baseline hub system were replaced with composite parts to improve the aeroelastic stability. In addition to this aeroelastic improvement of the rotor system, a weight reduction effect was also achieved of about 56%. To verify this aeroelastic stability improvement, hover and wind-tunnel tests were performed. An improvement of the aeroelastic stability was achieved at about 30%. In addition, a low-vibration small-scale blade was developed by the applying a composite material tailoring method to adjust the mass distribution along the blade. A small-scale blade was designed and tested to verify the low-vibratory characteristics comparison with an existing baseline blade. The improvement of vibration reduction was noted to be about 10–20%.",50,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031461,"This paper describes the systematic performance measurements conducted to understand the role of rotor geometry and blade pitching kinematics on the performance of a microscale cycloidal rotor. Key geometric parameters that were investigated include rotor radius, blade span, chord, and blade planform. Because of the flow curvature effects, the cycloidal-rotor performance was a strong function of the chord/radius ratio. The optimum chord/radius ratios were extremely high, around 0.5–0.8, depending on the blade pitching amplitude. Cycloidal rotors with shorter blade spans had higher power loading (thrust/power), especially at lower pitching amplitudes. Increasing the solidity of the rotor by increasing the blade chord, while keeping the number of blades constant, produced large improvements in power loading. Blade planform shape did not have a significant impact, even though trapezoidal blades with a moderate taper ratio were slightly better than rectangular blades. On the blade kinematics side, higher blade pitching amplitudes were found to improve the power loading of the cycloidal rotor. Asymmetric pitching with a higher pitch angle at the top than at the bottom produced better power loading. The chordwise optimum pitching axis location was observed to be around 25–35% of the blade chord. The power loading of the optimized cycloidal rotor was higher than that of a conventional microrotor.",50,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031633,"This paper studies the history of cabin pressurization regulations and makes policy recommendations to amend them in a manner that would encourage the design of all-new aircraft. One recently amended regulation (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Sec. 25.841) has an unintended byproduct. The Federal Aviation Administration must grant a compliance waiver in order to certify a new aircraft design with wing-mounted engines to fly at altitudes much above 40,000 ft. However, the Federal Aviation Administration grandfathers existing designs with higher certified ceilings and permits these designs to be modified under the Changed Product Rule (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Sec. 21.101). Because all but the largest commercial aircraft have their useful aerodynamic efficiency compromised if they are restricted to fly at or below 40,000 ft, the current regulation favors current production or derivative changes to existing certified aircraft over the development of an all-new modern airframe. Additional changes to this regulation could encourage the design of a new generation of aircraft with significantly lower fuel consumption. A proposed balancing test would address global environmental policy concerns against the foreseeable risks of sudden cabin depressurization.",50,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031846,"This paper proposes a framework to analyze the takeoff process of amphibious aircraft using decoupled hydrodynamic and aerodynamic numerical methods. The approach combines a volume-of-fluid calculation for the boat shape using FLUENT and a separate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculation using ANSYS/CFX for the wing–body configuration. The two separated calculations are repeated for every time step during takeoff, and steady calculations are assumed for each time step. The waterline is updated for each time step using calculations of flight mechanics based on engine data and hydrodynamic and aerodynamic results obtained. In addition, to improve the efficiency of the method, a drag breakdown method is adopted to replace the time-consuming viscous calculations. In the method, the frictional drag is calculated based on flat-plate theory, and wave resistance is computed using the inviscid model. The new method can achieve an accuracy of within 5% of those using fully viscous calculations, while halving the computing time. The method is applied in the analysis of a typical amphibious aircraft takeoff process and can be used in further optimizations of the amphibious configuration.",50,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031871,"In today’s atmosphere of constrained defense spending and reduced research budgets, determining how to allocate resources for research and design has become a critical and challenging task. In the area of aircraft design, there are many promising technologies to be explored, yet limited funds with which to explore them. In addition, issues concerning the uncertainty in technology readiness, as well as the quantification of the impact of a technology (or combinations of technologies), are of key importance during the design process. This paper presents a methodology that details a comprehensive and structured process in which to quantitatively explore the effects of technology for a given baseline aircraft. This process, called technology impact forecasting, involves the creation of an assessment environment for use in conjunction with defined technology scenarios, and it will have a significant impact on the resource allocation strategies for defense acquisition. The advantages and limitations of the method are discussed. In addition, an example of a technology impact forecasting application, an uninhabited combat aerial vehicle, is presented and serves to illustrate the applicability of this methodology to a military system.",50,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031899,"Tactical control during a closed-path continuous-descent operation is unwanted because it reduces the aircraft’s ability to follow the optimized descent profile. To prevent tactical control, air traffic controllers apply arbitrarily large spacing buffers to ensure separation throughout the descent. A controller support tool is required for early deconfliction, spacing, and sequencing to facilitate these operations without the need to apply large buffers. The time–space diagram decision support tool was developed previously to make the constraints and complexity of a continuous-descent operation perceptually evident and provide tools and information to the controller to be an active problem solver. This paper addresses the further development and validation of the interface. The concept of visual momentum was applied to enhance the efficiency of working the multidisplay interface that consists of the plan view display and time–space diagram. Direct-manipulation tools were developed to enable the controller to plan and implement actions, such as speed and altitude control. A controller-in-the-loop-experiment was set up to validate the interface. In the experiment, subjects used either the time–space diagram support tool or, as a baseline, a stack list that provided the required spacing and the time to lose or gain. Both interfaces enabled the subjects to space the aircraft safely and efficiently. Compared to the baseline, the time–space diagram interface freed time to plan traffic ahead using the direct-manipulation interfaces, which (according to all subjects) worked intuitively. The number of instructions per aircraft was decreased by 35%. Early accurate speed control was applied, and use of heading vectors was no longer necessary in most scenarios. As a result, aircraft commenced their continuous descent at a higher altitude and greater distance from the runway. Controller workload was significantly reduced, and situation awareness was increased.",50,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031918,"Nonlinear normal modes, which are defined as a nonlinear extension of the concept of linear normal modes, are a rigorous tool for nonlinear modal analysis. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the computation of nonlinear normal modes and of their oscillation frequencies can now be achieved for complex, real-world aerospace structures. The application considered in this study is the airframe of the Morane–Saulnier Paris aircraft. Ground vibration tests of this aircraft exhibited softening nonlinearities in the connection between the external fuel tanks and the wing tips. The nonlinear normal modes of this aircraft are computed from a reduced-order nonlinear finite element model using a numerical algorithm combining shooting and pseudo-arclength continuation. Several nonlinear normal modes, involving, e.g., wing bending, wing torsion, and tail bending, are presented, which highlights that the aircraft can exhibit very interesting nonlinear phenomena. Specifically, it is shown that modes with distinct linear frequencies can interact and generate additional nonlinear modes with no linear counterpart.",50,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031940,"Dynamic soaring of a sailplane in the Earth’s atmospheric boundary layer was computationally investigated over a range of conditions to explore the feasibility of sustained unpowered flight over open fields by taking advantage of wind shear. A point-mass sailplane model was studied, as well as a full six-degree-of-freedom piloted sailplane model. For the point-mass model, parameter sweeps were performed around a baseline 3-m (9.58-ft) wingspan sailplane having a weight of 15 kg (33 lb) and an aspect ratio of 20. Results from the point-mass model show that, in certain high-wind conditions, dynamic-soaring energy-conserving orbits are possible for flight trajectories extending from the ground to (656 ft) aloft. A six-degree-of-freedom piloted flight simulator was used, and it produced similar results that showed dynamic soaring over open fields for large vertical extents (extreme climb). Together, these results support the conclusion that it is possible to perform dynamic soaring in high-wind conditions through the atmospheric boundary layer to high altitudes over open land with model-scale unpowered sailplanes having both high wing loadings and high lift-to-drag ratios.",50,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031956,"The optimal shape of flying wings for subsonic and transonic speeds is examined using a suite of tools developed around a three-dimensional, time-spectral, Euler computational fluid dynamics solver. The first result in the study is a lift-constrained drag minimization, performed on an unswept, rectangular wing. When the spanwise twist distribution of the wing is varied, the elliptic optimum predicted by the low-speed inviscid theory can be reproduced. With this result as a reference, three different optimization formulations are explored. These formulations consider the addition of bending moment constraints, static-stability constraints, and dynamic-stability constraints. In each case, the design space of the problem is explored using both planform and shape variables to determine the optimal shape. These techniques are used to show that the addition of stability constraints has a significant impact on the optimal surface shape of the wing. In particular, it is shown that at lower speeds, the airfoil shape is sufficient to satisfy static-stability constraints, whereas dynamic-stability constraints require the addition of sweep. It is also shown that at higher speeds, the airfoil shape is insufficient to satisfy the stability constraint, either static or dynamic, and that the addition of sweep is necessary.",50,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031963,"In this work, several computational-fluid-dynamics-based approaches are employed to validate the airloads, trim angles, blade elastic motions, vortex positions, and structural loads of a rotor in low-speed, descending flight. To this end, two different comprehensive codes, CAMRAD II and DYMORE, are coupled with a computational fluid dynamics code, KFLOW, using a loose coupling methodology. A computational fluid dynamics approach using the measured blade motions is also carried out for the validation. For both clarity and consistency required in the relative comparison between different methods, an identical computational fluid dynamics grid system is used for the study. A fuselage effect is considered in the analysis. The predicted results are correlated against the measured data. CAMRAD II coupling shows good prediction for low-frequency loadings, elastic motions, and structural lag bending and torsion moments. DYMORE coupling demonstrates good matches on trim control angles, blade vortex interaction airloads, and structural flap bending but less satisfactory for lag motions. Initial results indicate poor correlation on aeropitching moments. This discrepancy is seen to be fixed when considering the actual pressure sensor locations used in the test. The blade–vortex miss distance at a desired instant is also evaluated. About 25% larger miss distance is obtained with a higher harmonic control input.",50,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031971,"Because of their potential for application in both civil and military sectors as well as the challenge in designing a tiny flying vehicle, micro aerial vehicles have attracted enormous attention. Several configurations of micro aerial vehicles are under development, namely fixed wing, rotary wing, and flapping wing. Under rotary-wing micro aerial vehicles, coaxial contrarotating configurations with a stabilizer bar seem to provide excellent stability behavior in pitch and roll degrees of freedom. This paper presents the results of an experimental study performed on a coaxial-contrarotor helicopter model to evaluate the performance of the rotor system using different rotor blades. The thrust and power of the rotors in independent and coaxial configurations were observed. The percentage thrust loss in the coaxial configuration was seen to be dependent on the ratio of the upper- and lower-rotor revolutions per minute as well as the spacing between the rotors. A theoretical analysis using a nonuniform inflow model was developed, which corroborated very well with the experimental data. Using low-Reynolds-number drag coefficients for the airfoil, the estimated power consumption of the rotors was found to match very well with the experimental data. A closed-form solution using a uniform inflow model to estimate the thrust performance of a coaxial rotor is proposed, which also matches with the experimental observations.",50,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031996,"The aerodynamic performance of small-scale fixed-wing flight is not well understood, and flight data is needed to gain a better understanding of the aerodynamics of micro air vehicles. The flight characteristics of micro air vehicles are difficult to measure because the small size and low weight prevent the use of conventional onboard instrumentation systems. In this research, an offboard motion tracking system captured the motion trajectory during the flights of a small off-the-shelf radio-controlled airplane that weighed 14.44 g (0.5094 oz) and had a span of 37.47 cm (14.75 in.). The recorded motion-path time histories were analyzed to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the airplane during unpowered flight. The results presented show the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of the micro air vehicle over a wide range of angles of attack at a nominal Reynolds number of 25,000. Specifically, lift and drag characteristics of the airplane were obtained from the analysis of the flight trajectories during quasi-steady nominal gliding flight, as well as unsteady high angle-of-attack flight. The nominal-gliding flights showed an almost linear lift curve and small unsteady effects that were in part due to the angle-of-attack rate. During the unsteady high angle-of-attack flight, as would be seen during perching maneuvers, deep stall maneuvers, and highly dynamic flight in confined spaces, the unsteady effects of rapid changes in the angle of attack significantly increased the lift coefficient during pitch-up maneuvers and then decreased the lift coefficient during pitch-down maneuvers. By using numerous flight tests in both regimes (nominal-gliding and unsteady high angle-of-attack flight), the results show the effect of the angular rate and expand on the limited existing work. The flight-test results presented show the influence of unsteady aerodynamic effects on the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of a micro air vehicle in both quasi-steady nominal gliding flight and unsteady high angle-of-attack flight.",50,5

The engine was tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center’s Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory. Two foam-metal liner designs were tested and compared to the hardwall baseline. Traditional single degree-of-freedom liner designs were also evaluated to provide a comparison to the state-of-the art design. This report presents the test setup and documents the test conditions. Far-field acoustic levels and limited engine performance results are also presented. The results show that the foam-metal liner achieved up to 5 dB of attenuation in the forward-quadrant radiated-acoustic power levels, which is equivalent to the traditional single degree-of-freedom liner design. Modest changes in engine performance were noted.",50,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032029,"The addition of glide slope control to guided airdrop systems has the potential to provide dramatic improvements in landing accuracy. Dynamic rigging incidence control has been demonstrated in flight tests and shown to provide effective glide slope control. The current work presents flight-test results exploring the range of glide slope control that can be achieved with high-performance parafoil canopies of two different aspect ratios. The low- and medium-aspect-ratio canopies have peak glide ratios of 4.4 and 4.9, respectively. By varying the incidence angle in flight, the glide slope can be reduced from these peak values to a glide slope near two for both canopies. Flight tests investigating the relationship between symmetric brake and incidence control demonstrate that symmetric braking produces effective airspeed control with little effect on glide slope, the incidence angle produces significant effects on both glide slope and airspeed, the rapid variation of the incidence angle in flight can lead to significant long period oscillations in both glide slope and airspeed, and the coupled effect of the control mechanisms of incidence angle and symmetric brake can produce dramatic changes in glide slope in any wind condition.",50,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032035,"A fast-time model for wake vortex behavior prediction in ground proximity is presented. This model takes into account the combined effects of ground proximity and wind (both crosswind and headwind components) on the wake vortex transport and decay. It aims to mimic the whole flow using a limited set of vortex particles to model both the primary two-vortex system and the ground-generated secondary vorticity. A redistribution of the vortex particles is also included in the model to limit the number of used particles and hence, guarantee a high computational efficiency. The model is integrated in the deterministic wake vortex model, which is a software that predicts, also in real-time, the temporal evolution of the wake vortices generated by a given aircraft evolving in given ambient meteorological conditions. The new ground effect model capacity is assessed using data from a measurement campaign and from large-eddy simulations. It is found that the model is able to reproduce the wake vortex behavior (both for transport and decay) for the most relevant times required for air traffic management applications.",50,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032055,"In this paper, an attempt is made to analytically predict the damage to a running turbofan jet engine if it gets hit by an incoming heat-seeking missile. The predictive methodology is based upon developing a LS-DYNA® finite-element model of the entire engine, as well as the exploding missile. The analytical simulation considers both the effect of ballistic energy, as well as the pressure pulse generated as a result of the detonation of the warhead in the missile. The engine model accurately captures the complex dynamic effect of the transient imbalance forces and gyroscopic moments that are caused in a dual concentric rotor system that is spinning at two different speeds. The numerical results presented here are directly applicable in determining the structural damage to individual components of a typical large turbofan jet engine that is used in commercial aviation. The high-velocity impact damage to engine components can involve penetration, fragmentation, and even the uncontained liberation of debris from the rotors. In general, the heat-seeking missile always has a tendency to go toward the engine core, but the impact results in large dynamic loads on the engine mount system.",50,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032063,"The correlation-based transition transport model was implemented in a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver and validated on various test cases. The model predicts two-dimensional transition phenomena such as transition due to Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities and separation-induced transition. The present work includes results for the application of the to two three-dimensional test cases, which are the inclined prolate spheroid and the ONERA M6 wing. Depending on the flow conditions, the computational results are in good agreement with the experimental data. Once the given flow conditions lead to three-dimensional transition phenomena, the transition prediction with the model is not reliable, because the model is based on the characteristics of two-dimensional boundary layers and three-dimensional transition mechanisms are not taken into account. To close this gap, the model was extended by an approach that accounts for transition due to crossflow instabilities in three-dimensional boundary layers. This approach and its implementation into the original model are introduced. First results for the flow over two different infinite swept wing configurations, which are the ONERA D wing and the NLF(2)-0415 wing, are presented.",50,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032064,"Future aerospace vehicles like hybrid wing/body, truss-braced wing, and “double bubble” would have pressurized noncircular fuselage structures and complex wing geometry. Traditional aircraft designs have led to the confidence and experience of designing such structures using the knowledge base built over the years and the resulting rules of thumb. However, there is a lack of experience of load calculations and design of complex, multifunctional, aircraft structural concepts for future aerospace vehicles. Designing such structures will require a physics-based optimization framework. Therefore, a new optimization framework, EBF3PanelOpt, is being developed. Commercial software MD-PATRAN (geometry modeling and mesh generation) and MD-NASTRAN (finite-element analysis) are integrated in EBF3PanelOpt framework using the Python programming environment to design stiffened panels with curvilinear stiffeners. Currently, EBF3PanelOpt optimizes the stiffened panel with curvilinear blade stiffeners, where the loads are applied only through the plate. During the optimization, the mass is minimized with the constraints on buckling, von Mises stress, and crippling or local failure of the stiffeners. EBF3PanelOpt is enhanced to have curvilinear T stiffeners with or without axial loads in addition to loads through plate. The panel/stiffener geometry is defined in a parametric fashion based on design variables that include variables for orientation and shape of the stiffeners, the thicknesses and heights of the webs and flanges of the stiffeners, and the plate-pocket thicknesses. This framework is supported with coarse-grained parallelism using Python to analyze multiple designs on the cluster. Using this framework, a vertical stabilizer skin panel of transport aircraft panel having two extreme load cases is optimized using with or without stiffener loads. When the equivalent uniform loads are applied only through the plate, the plate buckling becomes critical, but combined buckling of plate and stiffeners becomes critical when the loads are applied through both the plate and the stiffeners. When the uniform in-plane compressive loads are applied through both the plate and the stiffeners, the panel with straight T stiffeners is more optimal than the panel with curvilinear T stiffeners.",50,5

The optimization goal was to achieve an ice-free area over the protected zone by using the lowest energy possible. The power and/or length of the electric pads are considered as design variables. The optimization procedure is performed via a derivative-free method that typically needs many objective-function evaluations. This would be impractical as aero-icing flow simulation remains computationally intensive when coupled with conjugate heat-transfer calculations, as in the case of ice-protection systems. The cost is even more prohibitive for an optimization process, as a large number of simulations are needed. To make it practical, this work presents a surrogate-based optimization approach using proper orthogonal decomposition, in conjunction with kriging.

Relational-oriented systems engineering and technology tradeoff analysis leverages the relational-oriented systems engineering methodology coupled with the exploitation of transformations used in modeling and simulation to create a direct association between the quality function deployment methodology and standard quantitative conceptual design space exploration techniques leveraged in technology forecasting and trade studies. This association brings precision to quality function deployment that is model driven and mathematically founded. The approach highlights key deficiencies in quality function deployment when applied to early phase design and technology tradeoff studies for the development of systems. Relational-oriented systems engineering and technology tradeoff analysis proposes a more rigorous and generalized mathematical framework for conducting generic quality-function-deployment-type exercises to support decision-making in early systems engineering and design, and the advantages of the relational-oriented systems engineering and technology tradeoff analysis framework are demonstrated through the application of relational-oriented systems engineering and technology tradeoff analysis to a small-scale aerospace technology tradeoff.

In the first step, a buckling analysis of panels was performed to determine whether the panels satisfied the buckling constraint in an undamaged state. In the second step, stress distributions in the panel were analyzed to determine the location of the critical stress under combined shear and compression loadings. Then, a fracture analysis of the curvilinearly stiffened panel with a crack designed at the earlier-obtained location of the critical stress, which was the common location with the maximum magnitude of the principal stresses and von Mises stress, was performed under combined shear and tensile loadings. A mesh-sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the choice of the mesh density near the crack tip. All analyses were performed using the global–local finite element method using MSC.Marc, and the global finite element methods using MSC.Marc and ABAQUS. A negligible difference in results and 94% savings in the CPU time were achieved using the global–local finite element method over the global finite element method by using a mesh density of 8.4 element/mm ahead of the crack tip. To study the influence of different loads on basic modes of fracture, the shear and normal (tensile) loads were varied differently. It was observed that the case with the fixed shear load but variable normal loads, and the case with the fixed normal load but variable shear loads were mode I.

The focus of this contribution is on closed-loop control. Moreover, it is shown that our approach can be used for very different setups. For this, the modeling of the dynamic responses of the two systems and the synthesis of robust controllers are compared. For the highly three-dimensional wind-tunnel model, differential pressures are used as surrogate control variables as a correlation with the lift can be described by a lookup table. Two control inputs, pulsed blowing, and two output variables are exploited. In the glider study, with a profile that experiences a mostly two-dimensional flow, an approximate pressure gradient is used instead as a single output to avoid the necessity of such a lookup table. Active flow control is done again, exploiting pulsed blowing. For the controller synthesis, both in the single-input single-output and in the multivariable cases, the same approach is used, showing its versatility. In both setups, the closed-loop controllers succeed in adjusting the control inputs such that changing reference signals are followed, and the influence of disturbances are attenuated. For the civil aircraft model, completely new landing scenarios can be proposed using the closed-loop controller.",50,5

A finite volume flow solver was used to compute the flowfield, forces, and moments on the canopy in steady glide and at sideslip. The canopy surfaces were assumed to be impermeable and rigid. The oncoming flow barely penetrates the canopy opening, and creates a large separation bubble below the lower lip of each half-cell. The flow does not reattach, and a thick boundary layer is present on the lower surface of the canopy. The flow over the upper surface of the canopy remains attached until the separation point near the trailing edge. The lift increases linearly with the angle of attack up to about 12 deg, whereas the quarter-chord pitching moment decreases nearly linearly between 2 and 12 deg angle of attack. For sideslip angles up to 20 deg, the side force increases linearly with the sideslip angle even as the lift remains nearly constant. The yawing moment also increases linearly with the sideslip angle, whereas the rolling moment varies quadratically. The fidelity of the lifting-line theory in predicting the forces on the canopy during steady glide was assessed.",50,5
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032216,"F-16 testing revealed differences in limit-cycle oscillation response characteristics associated with subtle aerodynamic variations of the underwing missiles. Physical length differences between long and short missiles led to the accidental discovery of the limit-cycle oscillation sensitivity. In addition to the length difference, the long missiles were found to have builtup collar sections, to which the fins and canards were attached to the missile body. Two cases are presented where both long and short missiles were carried underwing. For the case with no wingtip missiles present, carriage of the long missiles showed significant limit-cycle oscillation response, while the short missiles showed very little response. For the case with wingtip missiles present, the limit-cycle oscillation response levels were slightly higher for carriage of the short missiles but were otherwise quite similar to the long-missile responses. Computational fluid dynamics on a rigid wing suggest that the differences between the long and short missiles alter the flowfield by changing the impinging shock strength and location on the lower wing surface outboard of the underwing missile. For the empty wingtip launcher case, the location of the impinging shock on the lower surface influences the strength of the shock on the upper surface. This influence on the upper shock strength could be a key contributor to the limit-cycle oscillation mechanism when wingtip aerodynamics do not inhibit the flowfield.",50,5
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032225,"Results carried out for the 4th AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop with the flow solver Edge are summarized. Simulations have been carried out for wing–body–tail configurations with three horizontal tail incidences and for one tail-off configuration. The computations consist of a grid-refinement study and a downwash study with polar calculations to explore the trimmed condition and delta effects. An investigation of the sensitivity to the grid and turbulence model is carried out from calculations on two sets of unstructured grids with three turbulence models, including the explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model, the SST model, and the Spalart–Allmaras model. The grid-refinement study, for which the flow is attached, shows rather small differences due to different grids and models. The major difference is obtained from the turbulence models where about 10 drag counts between the highest and lowest drag values are predicted, respectively, by the explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model and the Spalart–Allmaras model. The difference between the two sets of grids is only about two drag counts. The polar calculations in the downwash study also show rather small differences in which the same tendency for the drag prediction is observed as in the grid-refinement study. The largest differences between the solutions are due to different turbulence models and observed at the highest angles of attack, where the flow starts to separate after the shock on the wing.",50,5
