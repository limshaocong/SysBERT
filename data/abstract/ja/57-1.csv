1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035435,"This research focuses on the crashworthiness study and enhancement of commercial aircraft structures by developing crushable energy absorbers to work as vertical struts (stanchions). To assess their contribution on a representative crash scenario, a numerical simulation of a Boeing 737-200 drop test developed and verified with experimental data is used as a benchmark. The numerical model is then enhanced with four hybrid energy absorbers designed for programmed and progressive collapse, which are added in the cargo compartment connecting the floor beams and the frames. These devices are composed of a square aluminum tube filled with a composite skeleton and foam extrusions for maximized energy absorption. The enhanced aircraft is later simulated under hard-landing and water-ditching scenarios, analyzing the benefits resulting from the absorbers according to structural efficiency and biometric criteria. The results show increased plastic dissipation values by the main structural components given the modified collapse mechanism obtained when adding the crushable absorbers. Peak acceleration values are also reduced, consequently lessening the passenger injury prediction at the studied locations.",57,1
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035294,"This paper considers the effect of geometric nonlinearity on gust load analyses of high-aspect-ratio commercial aircraft. Three variants of a conceptual aircraft, featuring wing aspect ratios of 10, 18, and 26, are sized using an industrially inspired procedure to obtain realistic structures of existing and future designs. These aircraft are modeled in a nonlinear aeroelastic framework, featuring a geometrically exact beam formulation coupled with unsteady aerodynamics, and subjected to a gust loads process adapted for nonlinear systems. The gust analysis is also carried out using a linear approach (linearizing the equations of motion about an undeformed or trimmed geometry) to understand how nonlinearities influence the loads and dynamic behavior of aircraft as the aspect ratio increases. Load envelopes show that vertical shear and bending moments are predicted well by the linear analyses, even for the aspect-ratio-26 case, providing that the linearization is performed about the trimmed geometry. In contrast, the in-plane and axial loads are significantly underestimated using linear analyses. Torque behavior is problem specific and therefore difficult to generalize. Even on the aspect-ratio-10 case, which would traditionally be considered as a linear problem, it can be shown that the torque loads are considerably affected by nonlinearity.",57,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035445,"The application of riblets on a typical regional turboprop configuration is discussed in this paper. The effect of the riblets is modeled as a singular roughness problem by a proper boundary condition at the wall. The model, already proposed in a previous paper, is briefly described. The drag prediction capabilities are verified by showing some airfoil flow applications. Then a typical wing–body of a regional aircraft is considered. The configuration has been designed to have extended natural laminar flow in cruise conditions. Riblets are applied at flow specifications representative of cruise in combination with the natural laminar flow technology and in climb/descent conditions. A comparison of the two technologies in terms of drag reduction is presented. Their combined application can result in a cruise drag reduction of more than 20%. The resulting fuel savings during a typical operational day are evaluated.",57,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035556,"Load control is the reduction of extreme aerodynamic forces produced by gusts, maneuvers, and turbulence to enable lighter, more efficient aircraft. To design an effective control system, the actuator’s response in terms of amplitude and phase lag must be known. Current load control technologies are limited to low-frequency disturbances due to their large inertia. This paper evaluates a potential high-frequency alternative: the minitab using periodic and transient deployments on a NACA0012 airfoil in wind-tunnel experiments. Periodic deployment for reduced frequencies, exhibits a normalized lift response amplitude, which decays with increasing comparable to Theodorsen’s circulation function but with substantially higher lag. Transient deployment, at rates as low as , illustrates a delay in aerodynamic response. The delay is larger for outward minitab motion than inward; and 4, respectively, for and increases with . The flowfields show that the delay in response and the reduction in effectiveness for dynamic minitab deployment are due to delayed growth of the separated region behind the minitab. The aerodynamic response due to minitab deployment is approximated as the response of a first-order system, which is pertinent to control system design. This simple characterization for amplitude reduction and delay in response makes it well suited to load control.",57,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035514,"The present study proposes a new configuration of an internally blown flap based on a multielement airfoil for the high-lift system of an amphibious aircraft. Triobjective optimization based on computational fluid dynamics is carried out. The optimization results show that the present configurations have efficient lift enhancement and reach the tradeoff of the lift to drag ratio and low angle-of-attack performance. The optimized configuration also has good stall behavior and better poststall performance. A parametric analysis is conducted to test the sensitivity of each design parameter, and the results prove the robustness of the configuration. The results of different jet momentum coefficients show that two critical values exist that separate the lift versus jet momentum curve into three segments corresponding to different flow phenomena, which indicates that the circulation control rule for a multielement airfoil with a blown flap is different and more complicated.",57,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035639,"An experimental study was performed in a water tunnel to evaluate the effects of continuous and pulsed blowing jets on the counter-rotating vortices generated by the afterbody of a slanted base cylinder. Drag reductions from continuous blowing through circular jets were found to vary significantly with direction and location, and approached 7% when blowing outboard from upstream locations on the upswept face. However, for all circular jets tested, the external power required was larger than the power saved due to the drag reduction. Jet vortices restricted shear layer development, leading to smaller afterbody vortex cores further from the surface. A high-aspect-ratio jet flap, ejecting nearly parallel to the freestream, achieved drag reductions close to 9%, equating to the net energy savings of almost 3% for the best case. Jet vortices shortened the shear layer, resulting in vortices with reduced circulation, which were displaced away from the upswept face. Pulsing the jet flap resulted in improved drag reductions and energy savings (up to around 6%) compared with the equivalent continuous blowing case at the same time-averaged jet momentum coefficient. Pulsed blowing caused an increase in vortex separation and meandering, whereas the circulation was reduced by up to 10% of that for continuous blowing.",57,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035476,"Technological advances in areas such as battery technology, autonomous control, and ride-hailing services, combined with the scale-free nature of electric motors, have sparked significant interest in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for urban air mobility. In this work, we use simplified models for the aerodynamics, propulsion, propeller–wing flow interaction, and flight mechanics to carry out gradient-based optimization studies for the takeoff-to-cruise trajectory of a tandem tilt-wing eVTOL aircraft. We present results for optimizations with and without stall and acceleration constraints, with varying levels of flow augmentation from propellers, and find that the optimal takeoffs involve stalling the wings or flying near the stall angle of attack. However, we find that the energy penalty for avoiding stall is practically negligible. Additionally, we find that without acceleration constraints, the optimized trajectories involve rapidly transitioning to forward flight and accelerating, followed by climbing at roughly constant speed, and then accelerating to the required cruise speed. With an acceleration constraint for passenger comfort, the transition, climb, and acceleration phases are more gradual and less distinct. We also present results showing the impact of wing loading and available power on the optimized trajectories.",57,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035467,"Dual-solver hybrid methodologies that couple fluid solvers in different regions of the flowfield have been developed to accelerate convergence with minimal compromises in accuracy. A new dual-solver hybrid analysis framework that addresses some of the major shortcomings of prior dual-solver hybrid methodologies has been developed through an academic–industry partnership. In this effort, one of the hybrid solvers, comprising of a computational fluid dynamics–computational structural dynamics (CFD-CSD) solver coupled with a Lagrangian wake-panel module, is assessed. The hybrid solver’s ability to replicate the accuracy of the more expensive CFD-CSD approach and its ability to capture the physics of the rotor system are presented. The criteria that have been evaluated include integrated aerodynamic performance quantities, structural loads and moments, and near-body wakes. If the best practices extracted from this analysis are applied, the analysis with a reduced off-body CFD mesh is able to predict forward-flight rotor behavior that is within 4% of a full CFD simulation with up to 70% cost savings. This accuracy has been assessed on both high-speed and high-thrust flight conditions and has been quantitatively verified for aerodynamic, structural, and hub variables of interest at a number of radial blade stations for a frequency range of 0–16/rev.",57,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035588,"The three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes k-omega-Shear Stress Transport Langtry-Menter (SSTLM) and turbulence models were studied to understand their application and transition prediction capability for incompressible flow regimes. Additionally, a novel protocol is presented for systematically studying the near-wall flow physics over a sharp trailing-edged SD7003 airfoil subjected to flow with varying freestream intensities and angles of attack and at three chord-based Reynolds numbers of , , and . A complex low-Reynolds-number near-wall flow phenomenon known as the formation and destruction of the laminar separation bubble, eventually leading to flow transition from the laminar to the turbulent regimes, was resolved using both turbulence models; and their accuracy was compared with implicit large-eddy simulation surface pressure predictions. Mean and instantaneous flowfields were extracted, thus leading to a more thorough quantitative and qualitative comparison. Considering all flow characteristics, the correlation-based turbulence model was shown to predict more reasonable flow transition characteristics for simple airfoil configurations.",57,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035455,"Beyond aerodynamic stall, the analysis of aircraft flight requires models accurately representing nonlinearities and instabilities. Previous bifurcation analysis studies therefore had a priori knowledge of the aircraft dynamics including dynamic damping. Yet, unlike airliners, extensive wind-tunnel tests and high-fidelity models are rarely available for small unmanned aircraft. Instead, continuous fluid dynamic simulations may provide basic insights into the aerodynamics, however limited to static conditions. In this paper, bifurcation analysis is presented as a tool to discuss the effects of unidentified pitch-damping dynamics during deep-stall transition that allows development of a nonlinear pitch-damping model for a small unmanned aircraft. By preliminary study of the static case, the model is extended based on deep-stall flight data to predict dynamics and stability. As a result, the deep-stall modes of the extended model are investigated in full envelope.",57,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035524,"The deicing performance of an electrothermal system is critical to inflight safety; accordingly, a numerical study on dynamic deicing and the subsequent experimental verification are both performed. Different electrothermal systems are designed first; then, a coupling calculation method is developed by employing the equivalent heat transfer coefficient and the boundary condition iteration. The performance analysis is conducted by considering the variations of temperature and ice accretion, with their transient characteristics investigated. At the end of heating time, the minimum surface temperature ranges from 5.5 to 10°C, without the internal structure overheated. And, the maximum thickness of ice accretion is determined to be 1.39 mm, which is tolerable for the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft. Certain advantages of system B are found in the heating rate, whereas the cross-shaped parting strip installed on system A successfully prevents the leading edge from icing and divides the icing area. Furthermore, several effective deicing cycles of the two systems are observed during the wind-tunnel test, indicating the rationality of the preliminary design. The average and standard deviations of the experimental and numerical results are 13.2 and 0.79, respectively, which verify the accuracy of the dynamic simulation model.",57,1

14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035437,"Aircraft concept development is the process of generating feasible concepts/configurations and selecting the one that best fulfills the requirements. It is a decisive step as it significantly affects the entire design process and ultimately the aircraft performance. Ideally, all possible configurations are considered during the concept development process. However, due to the enormous varieties of aircraft concepts, the method that considers all concepts and selects the best one is yet a challenge. Therefore, employing designers’ experience/intuition and/or replicating/evolving existing similar configurations remain the predominant methods used. Despite their advantages, such approaches may result in selecting poor configurations or overlooking valuable ones, especially when designing unconventional aircraft. Poor configurations significantly increase the design and manufacturing costs and time, as they typically require rework in the later design phases. This paper presents a systematic concept development methodology to efficiently generate and select the best aircraft configuration, during the conceptual design phase, using structured design methods. The methodology considers the identification and prioritization of all possible alternatives for the aircraft components, an effective generation of the candidate configurations, and selection of the best configuration. The methodology is exemplified via a case study where the best configuration for a highly maneuverable transitional unmanned aerial vehicle is selected.",57,1
