2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033040,"Two aeroelastic design approaches are applied to a supersonic lambda wing configuration with the goal of improving the wing’s aeroelastic performance. Aeroelastic tailoring and active aeroelastic wing technologies are investigated in a sequential manner to quantify their benefits. Industry-standard tools are used to perform these design studies. First, a finite element model of a lambda wing is developed. Second, eight structural variants of the finite element model are created to study variations in wing stiffness. Finally, two sizing optimization processes are applied. The first is an aeroelastic sizing approach standard to MSC NASTRAN, and the second is an active aeroelastic wing design process, which is presented in this paper. The latter process integrates control and structural sizing design variables together. Both of these processes are used to size all eight structural variants. The optimized variants are compared based on weight and control surface effectiveness. Additionally, the optimal variations in percent ply utilization over the wing for the lightest weight concept are explored. It is found that applying aeroelastic tailoring simultaneously with active aeroelastic wing has the potential to reduce the aircraft gross takeoff weight by 7% in lambda wing configurations.",54,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033467,"A combined rotor transient responses and analysis tools/computational fluid dynamics effort was completed to assess the rotor response in a complex flowfield. A generic helicopter on an oil-rig platform was chosen because the bluff nature of the rig presents unique challenges to rotorcraft operations. The rotor start-up and shutdown simulation model was validated with the test data. Comprehensive studies of rotor transient responses under various wind directions and wind speeds were conducted to establish the safe-operation envelope. The study found that horizontal wind velocities may be accelerated by the oil-rig building corner, and cause significant rotor flap motions. The upwash and downwash flow due to the blockage of the helicopter fuselage to the crosswind had great impact on rotor transient responses, and the peak blade flap responses can be 2.5 times higher than the simulation results when the effect of airframe on air wake was ignored. The influence of unsteady air wake on rotor transient responses was also investigated, and the results showed that it could increase the blade tip deflections by 70% if the unsteady-flow components were included. The sensitivity of the rotor-blade initial azimuth positions for rotor start-up operations was also examined.",54,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033698,"The flowfield near the angle-of-attack sensors of an Airbus A320 aircraft was modeled numerically, simulating low-speed and high-speed cruise conditions. Because of concerns about the effect of a cargo door installation on the performance of these sensors, an imperfection caused by the gap between the door and the fuselage was modeled. Consequently, by comparing the two computational models, the differences in the flowfield could be studied. The main objectives of this study were to correlate the local streamline angle with the airplane geometrical angle of attack and to quantify the effect of such surface imperfections due to the cargo door installation. At this initial phase, the study was limited to zero sideslip flight conditions. Computed results indicate that the angle-of-attack sensor height is on the same order of magnitude as the local boundary-layer thickness, but nearby flow direction is unaffected by the door groove perturbation. The main conclusion therefore is that the cargo door groove has no significant effect on the flow direction near the angle-of-attack sensors and on the local boundary-layer thickness.",54,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033907,"The primary objective of this work was to develop and demonstrate a process for accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification and certification prediction of low-boom, supersonic, transport aircraft. High-fidelity computational-fluid-dynamics models of multiple low-boom configurations were investigated, including the Lockheed Martin SEEB-ALR body of revolution, the NASA 69 deg delta wing, and the Lockheed Martin 1021-01 configuration. A nonintrusive polynomial chaos surrogate approach was used for reduced computational cost of propagating mixed inherent (aleatory) and epistemic uncertainty through both the computational-fluid-dynamics model and the near-field to ground-level boom propagation model. A methodology has also been introduced to quantify the plausibility of a design to pass a certification under uncertainty. Results of this study include the analysis of each of the three configurations of interest under inviscid and fully turbulent flow assumptions. A comparison of the uncertainty outputs and sensitivity analyses between the configurations is also given. The results of this study illustrate the flexibility and robustness of the developed framework as a tool for uncertainty quantification and certification prediction of low-boom, supersonic aircraft.",54,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033866,"Automated fiber placement technology has pushed for the need to explore nonconventional fiber paths in laminated composites. This paper investigates optimal spatially varying fiber paths in a symmetric linear orthotropic laminate, which could increase the critical buckling temperature under uniform applied thermal loads. The key idea here is to achieve gains in buckling performance yet focus on manufacturability of the obtained optimal fiber path. The subject of this study is a four-layer symmetric orthotropic laminated plate, with a central circular cutout that is clamped on all the edges. A novel finite element algorithm is proposed, which imposes a condition on the definition of discrete fiber angles within each element. The main objectives of the proposed finite element approach are to maintain continuity of the fiber paths and to use a computationally efficient model by reducing the number of optimization variables.",54,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033805,"This study investigates the effects of a variable-geometry raked wingtip on the aeroelastic behavior and the maneuverability of transport aircraft with very large aspect-ratio truss-braced wings. These truss-braced wing designs are obtained from the multidisciplinary design optimization environment presented here while minimizing the fuel burn of a double-aisle aircraft having a flight mission similar to that of a Boeing 777-200 long-range aircraft. The wingtip can be swept forward and aft relative to the wing by a novel control effector mechanism. Results show that a variable-geometry raked wingtip can be used to achieve required roll control by judiciously sweeping it relative to the wing at various flight conditions. It has an added benefit that it can also be used for flutter avoidance. Such benefits of the variable-geometry raked wingtip allow the operation of truss-braced wing configurations, which have up to 10% lower fuel burn than comparable optimized conventional cantilever wing designs. Without the variable-geometry raked wingtip, such configurations fail to meet the required flutter speed and roll control capability. The variable-geometry raked wingtip is thus an enabling technology for truss-braced wing aircraft and other large aspect-ratio configurations.",54,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033563,"An aircraft antiskid braking system control method based on tire–runway friction model is proposed in this paper. The purpose is to keep tire–runway friction around its maximum value and prevent wheels from working in low-braking-efficiency regions. This paper defines a slip-factor parameter to distinguish between the adhesion region and the slip region, so that we can accurately obtain the location of the tire–runway friction peak. The slip factor needs signals, including wheel angular velocity and braking torque, and needs no aircraft longitudinal velocity value, which is difficult to detect. The proposed control method can automatically identify current runway conditions and yields robust performance with respect to unknown or changing runway conditions. Computer software simulations are conducted to verify the feasibility of the control method, and experiments are conducted on a ground-inertia braking test bench to validate the control method. The results show that the controller can detect the actual maximum tire–runway friction peak and also provide high adaptability in different tire–runway conditions.",54,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033777,"This paper deals with the modeling of the dynamics of nonstructural components in aeronautical structures. It is shown how the overall response in the low to midfrequency is governed by a transfer of energy between the load-carrying structure and the nonstructural components. The effect of these elements can be reproduced by using averaged point transfer functions. A numerical model defined in the frequency domain, capable of depicting such transmission and compatible with standard industrial finite element model, is presented together with an experimental validation.",54,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033708,"Information on the suggested aircraft airspeeds can be obtained from flight manuals, but the actual airspeeds flown by an aircraft will vary based on the aircraft landing weight, airport altitude, wind conditions, and other Air-Traffic-Control related factors. The recent advent of new tools and an abundance of new, highly accurate aircraft surveillance data have enabled a reevaluation of past airspeed profile assumptions. The resulting analysis provides a stronger representation for airspeeds flown on final approach and initial departure by the aircraft types comprising a large percentage of U.S. Instrument Flight Rules operations. Furthermore, the time to fly is calculated to determine how long it takes the trailer aircraft to fly the distance to the point where the leader generates a particular portion of the wake. Although this work is performed to provide improved inputs for Recategorization Phase II analyses, the airspeed profiles derived from aircraft surveillance data will also be valuable to other Air Traffic Control applications (such as the Advanced Traffic Proximity Alert, the Interval Management-Paired Approach, Time-Based Flow Management, and the Integrated Departure Arrival Capability) that require accurate knowledge of how aircraft approach and departure airspeeds vary in actual operations.",54,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032968,A new computational method for droplet concentration was developed to efficiently predict droplet impact efficiency on airplane surface elements. The method computes concentration along a Lagrangian path in combination with a novel Eulerian approach for the particle velocity divergence. The combined approach is termed the globally Eulerian/locally Lagrangian approach. This method was compared to conventional ensemble-based and area-based approaches for impact efficiency in terms of accuracy and efficiency for an inviscid cylinder flow and a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based airfoil flow. The globally Eulerian/locally Lagrangian method provided good agreement with analytical and experimental results and avoided the large number of particle paths needed for statistical convergence (unlike bin methods) while allowing extension to unsteady flowfields (unlike area-based methods).,54,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033833,"Aircraft conceptual design traditionally uses simplified analysis and optimization methods to generate the basic configuration of the aircraft. Analysis methods cannot fully represent the real physical phenomena, and hence the optimum solution may fail to satisfy the constraints when more sophisticated analysis is applied. This research proposes the use of a database to estimate the prediction errors associated with a particular analysis method. Newly proposed adaptive piecewise-linear fuzzy membership functions accurately represent the intervals of prediction errors to compensate for the discrepancies caused by analysis. A possibility-based design optimization framework is developed to solve nonprobabilistic design problems with uncertainties represented by the adaptive piecewise-linear fuzzy membership intervals. A two-seater light aircraft design problem has been solved to demonstrate the proposed method. The adaptive piecewise-linear fuzzy membership fu\nctions for six major analysis modules of in-house software were constructed using information about 15 aircraft stored in the database. Estimated errors of the analysis stay within 10% range. The adaptive piecewise-linear fuzzy membership function for selected parameters stores 39% more samples on average than the triangular functions that are traditionally used for possibility-based design optimization. The results of the design problem show that the objective function is improved by 3.4% with uncertain intervals covering 100% of database samples and by 46.1% with 12.3% database coverage.",54,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033623,Fundamental research for sonic boom reduction is needed to quantify the interaction of shock waves generated from the aircraft wing or tail surfaces with a nozzle exhaust plume. Aftbody shock waves that interact with the exhaust plume contribute to the near-field pressure signature of a vehicle. The plume and shock interaction is studied using computational fluid dynamics and compared with experimental data from a coaxial convergent–divergent nozzle flow in an open jet facility. A simple diamond-shaped wedge is used to generate the shock in the outer flow to study its impact on the inner jet flow. Results show that the compression from the wedge deflects both the nozzle plume and the shocks on the opposite side of the plume. The sonic boom pressure signature of the nozzle exhaust plume is modified by the presence of the wedge. Both the experimental results and computational predictions show changes in plume deflection and location of the shock from the wedge.,54,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033703,"A brief history of the X-15-3 adaptive control system and an analysis of the destructive limit-cycle oscillation that occurred during its final November 1967 flight are presented. The X-15 was a piloted single-seat rocket-propelled hypersonic research aircraft operated by the NASA Flight Research Center from 1959 until 1968. Due to the limited information previously available in the public domain and the 1968 decision by the accident investigation board to forego detailed analysis of the adaptive control system’s role in the accident, it was widely assumed in the adaptive controls community that an anomalous behavior of the adaptive component caused the loss of control. Notwithstanding the complex human factors and subsystem failures that contributed to the accident, it is shown that the adaptation dynamics were not a causal factor. The limit cycle observed in the flight data is reproduced in a nonlinear time-domain simulation. Describing function analysis reveals that the instability was caused by a latent design error in the inner-loop structural filters that did not account for the nonlinear behavior of the X-15 servoactuator under rate saturation when coupled with the lightly damped aircraft longitudinal mode at high Mach numbers.",54,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033719,"High-resolution particle image velocimetry measurements were taken to document the evolution of the tip vortices trailed from a rotor system operating in ground effect, with centrifugal-driven (i.e., pumping) spanwise blowing blade designs. All pumping blade designs used the same intake and internal slot, with exit slots oriented at angles of 0, 30, 45, and 60 deg above the horizontal axis. Each blade set was tested in a hovering state in ground effect at a blade loading coefficient of 0.080. Additional measurements were also performed to examine the effect of mass flow rate on tip vortex diffusion. Each pumping blade designs incurred a power penalty, resulting in part from the increased profile losses associated with the exit slots. The 30, 45, and 60 deg pumping blade designs had a degraded performance when compared to that of the 0 deg pumping blade, which was hypothesized to result from negative thrust effects. At the higher thrust condition, the tip vortices trailed from the pumping blade designs persisted in the wake as concentrated regions of vorticity, and at older wake ages, produced relatively similar flowfields. However, at the lower thrust condition, the tip vortices were found to be significantly more diffused.",54,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033622,"A model for the propulsion system of a small-scale electric unmanned aerial system is presented. This model is based on a blade element momentum (BEM) model of the propeller, with corrections for tip losses, Mach effects, three-dimensional flow components, and Reynolds scaling. Particular focus is placed on the estimation of scale effects not commonly encountered in the full-scale application of the BEM modeling method. Performance predictions are presented for geometries representative of several commercially available propellers. These predictions are then compared with experimental wind tunnel measurements of the propellers’ performance. The experimental data support the predictions of the proposed BEM model and point to the importance of scale effects on prediction of the overall system performance.",54,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033741,"Time and energy managed operations is a new integrated planning and guidance concept that optimizes the vertical aircraft trajectory to achieve a continuous engine-idle descent while satisfying time constraints. To investigate acceptance of the concept and the influence of pilot involvement on performance, time and energy managed operations were evaluated in a real-time simulation involving nine airline pilots. Three human–machine interface variants were tested; these varied in the level of information presented. The results were compared to computer simulations with a zero-delay pilot response model, to evaluate the effect of pilot reaction time variation on performance and environmental impact. Results indicated that the effects of pilot response delays are limited. Pilots preferred the human–machine interface variant that included a timer to support accurate selection of flaps and gear. Although the timer did not significantly affect system performance, it did reduce variation in the pilot response. Results further indicated that modifications to the time and energy managed operations concept are possible to further improve time performance.",54,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033667,"A distributed atmospheric turbulence model is developed for helicopter flight simulation. The impacts of different aerodynamic surfaces on handling qualities with helicopter in turbulence are analyzed. Both helicopter flight dynamic model and turbulence model are validated against the flight test data, which shows that the proposed model improves the accuracy of the simulation of rotor blade element turbulence model on the vertical axis within the interested frequency range for handling-quality analysis. A quantitative index is developed to study the impact of turbulence on helicopter handling qualities by analyzing the effects of different aerodynamic surfaces on helicopter response to turbulence. The results show that the main rotor has the dominant effects on both the heave and roll handling qualities, the airframe has the primary effect on the pitch handling quality, and the tail rotor has an important effect on the yaw handling quality. Furthermore, the impacts of the main rotor in turbulence on the helicopter handling qualities of roll, pitch, and yaw increase with the forward speed at lower speeds but decrease at higher speeds. The increment trend with the forward speed of the airframe’s impacts on the pitch and yaw handling qualities reduces at higher speeds.",54,1

Two M8528-P1 actuators were used to deform the surface of a forward-swept thin, compliant composite wing. The general approach, which included MATLAB, ABAQUS, and Athena Vortex Lattice, is described. The planform design and initial flight testing are discussed. The computational model was validated first with static tests, and then quasi-static wind-tunnel tests were used to validate the aeroelastic model. Digital image correlation was used to compare the expected and measured displacements of the wing. Flight loads were also compared for various angles of attack. The results indicated good agreement for angles of attack well within the standard flight envelope, despite small discrepancies in geometry.",54,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033665,"When a helicopter takes off, lands, or makes hovering or taxiing flights in ground effect, its downwash interferes with the ground. Encounters with such highly turbulent helicopter wakes have resulted in the two small fixed-wing aircraft crashes in the United Kingdom. Due to these accidents, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is investigating the helicopter wake structure in ground effect, especially during taxiing, by means of computational fluid dynamics and flight testing. The base computational fluid dynamics code is structured grid solver rFlow3D, which has systematically been developed for helicopter applications at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The rFlow3D solver is a highly versatile computational fluid dynamics code that can numerically simulate flows around helicopters with a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers and can perform rotor trim analysis with elastic blade deformations. In the flight experiment described herein, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency research helicopter H145 (EC145, BK117 C-2) performed taxiing above a runway, and its wakes were measured by Light Detection and Ranging and ultrasonic anemometers. The variation of the characteristic wake structure with the advance ratio was clearly revealed in the computational fluid dynamics and was supported indirectly by the flight experiment results.",54,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033965,"A centrifugally powered pneumatic de-icing system was developed and tested. Two prototype designs were fabricated and parametrically tested at representative icing conditions. The superior performing design was able to remove ice thicknesses as small as 0.078 in. at and 0.112 in. at . This configuration was reproduced and installed on the outboard 8 ft section of a full-scale 24 ft K-MAX blade. Full-scale icing tests were conducted at Kaman’s outdoor whirl tower using a custom portable icing cloud generator to produce a controlled icing cloud as well as a secondary cloud generator that produced large, uncontrolled water droplets. During full-scale icing tests, the de-icing system was able to remove ice thicknesses as small as 0.08 in. at 270 rpm. A method to calculate power drawn from the main rotor during de-icing system operation is presented. During depressurization, the system draws a peak power of 4.15 hp from the rotor and 0.02 hp during pressurization. The total weight of the de-icing system is comparable to that of existent erosion caps installed on in-service helicopters.",54,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033971,"The main purpose of this study is to develop a test method to evaluate grassy airfields by determining the mechanical properties that affect airfield performance during takeoff, touchdown, and landing roll. A number of airfields with grassy or partially grassy runways in European Union countries could be more effective for flight operations with better knowledge of the surfaces and their impact on field performance. The proposed method could provide this information. The concept of the method (and an advantage over the existing methods) is to determine 1) wheel–surface braking friction, 2) rolling resistance, and 3) surface roughness. All these parameters are essential for wheel–soil interactions and performance of an airplane on the airfield. Friction coefficients would be determined with a portable tester, which has been designed and built. The complete test method will also include procedures, instructions, and comparison charts. The plan is to present the complete test method for certification so it may be used widely by the general aviation community.",54,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033454,"An all-moving fin–actuator model was designed to explore the principles and methods of aeroelastic semiphysical simulations. Both mathematical analyses and wind-tunnel tests were conducted to support and verify the simulation. The dynamic characteristics of the actuator were introduced into the flutter calculations, which were also compared to a conventional flutter algorithm. Shakers were used to generate aerodynamic forces in the simulation. A nonlinear variable-structure controller was developed to solve the force coupling problems between shakers. The real-time aerodynamic calculation scheme and the locations of sensors were specifically designed for the test model used in this study. Good agreements were achieved for the flutter boundaries using these approaches. The semiphysical simulation was thus shown to be an economical and practical method for solving aeroelastic problems. This work enriches the literature on aeroelastic simulation methodologies.",54,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033885,"The intent of this investigation was to survey the potential and establish an array of technical targets for future aircraft employing hybrid-electric battery-based voltaic-Joule/Brayton motive power systems with no additional electrical energy drawn from generators mechanically coupled to gas turbines. Irrespective of passenger accommodation (that is, 70 or 180 passengers), it was concluded that the trifan morphology (two underwing podded gas turbines and one aft-fuselage-mounted electrically driven motor) would be an appropriate choice. Although a battery cell-level gravimetric specific energy (referred to as “battery energy density”) of at least would be desirable, a less ambitious, yet still aggressive, target of for battery energy density was found to yield a worthwhile outcome. In terms of effecting a 15% block fuel reduction compared to a suitably projected gas-turbine-only year-2035 aircraft and, in keeping with the aforementioned technical recommendations design range targets of 900 nm (1666 km) and 1100 nm (2037 km) for 70-passenger and 180-passenger aircraft, respectively, were suggested. Finally, it was established assuming the trifan morphology normal conducting machines delivering shaft power output of 4.5 MW for the 70-passenger application and 8.5 MW for the 180-passenger aircraft would be required.",54,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033834,"In this paper, the control law design for flexible aircraft is discussed. First, the traditional procedure of decoupling rigid-body and aeroelastic dynamics with low-pass and notch filters is addressed, with focus on controller performance as well as the resulting stability margin issues. A procedure based on a unified formulation of the flexible aircraft dynamics for flight control law design is proposed. In this procedure, the aeroservoelastic dynamics is assessed in the loop, and the offline filtering process is avoided. The formulation is applied to the virtual aircraft generic narrow-body airliner, with improvements in closed-loop performance and stability margins.",54,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033815,"Unsteady flow around deployed landing gears is a significant contributor to aircraft noise on approach. The far-field sound is largely determined by the fluctuating pressures on the gear surface, quantities that have yet to be fully characterized even for simplified representations. The current work reports axle- and wheel-surface data from a comprehensive set of measurements on a generic, two-wheel, landing-gear model. The results show the expected high levels of unsteadiness on areas exposed to large-scale separated flow, of which some (wheel rear surfaces and forward edges) can be identified from steady data, but others (wheel faces adjacent to axle wakes, flow impingements on sidewalls) cannot. The forward-edge values for the current, untripped configuration are markedly greater than previously reported measurements with artificial transition fixing. Spectral analysis highlights a further category of potentially important contributions that are not easily detected in overall rms values: high-frequency unsteadiness associated with turbulent attached, or attaching, flows. A key implication of these results is the need for accurate representation of the true, full-scale, boundary-layer state in computations and model-scale testing.",54,1

Two types of trajectories were flown, and the flight state was recorded using inertial and satellite navigation equipment. The data were used to recreate the flight in a simulator where the aspect angles and range to the measurement system could be calculated. The measured radar cross section as a function of time was presented and compared to various statistical fluctuation models, including the distributions used in Swerling cases. Findings showed that the generalized Pareto distribution fit the measured data best and that Swerling case 2 was a good candidate for describing the dynamics of the radar cross section at the Ku band when the aircraft approached the radar head-on. The measured radar cross-section data were analyzed using the fast Fourier transform, from which fluctuation rates for different carrier frequencies and trajectories could be estimated.",54,1
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034000,"This paper presents an experimental assessment of the working principles of pylon trailing-edge blowing for the mitigation of the interaction between a pusher propeller and its associated pylon. The experiments were performed at the Large Low-Speed Facility of the German–Dutch wind tunnels, using a powered propeller model and an upstream pylon equipped with a trailing-edge blowing system. Inflow microphone measurements demonstrated the impact of pylon installation on the propeller’s tonal noise emissions, with increases of up to 16 dB relative to the isolated propeller. Analysis of the unsteady blade pressures showed that this installation effect was caused by the impulsive increase in blade loading during the pylon-wake passage. The efficacy of pylon trailing-edge blowing to reduce the momentum deficit in the pylon wake was confirmed by stereoscopic particle-image-velocimetry measurements between the pylon and the propeller. Consequently, application of the pylon-blowing system alleviated the pylon-installation effects at the source. At an intermediate thrust setting, the rms of the blade-load fluctuations due to the wake encounter was reduced by up to 60%, resulting in noise emissions approximately equal to those recorded for the isolated propeller.",54,1
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033845,"The effectiveness of asymmetrical and symmetrical plasma actuators for enhancing the aerodynamic performances of a wing has been investigated through the flow separation control experiment in a low-speed wind tunnel. The asymmetrical plasma actuator is a typical single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator and induces a one-way airflow. Compared with the asymmetrical dielectric barrier discharge actuator, the symmetrical actuator produced a bidirectional tangential jet. The two actuators were mounted on the leading edge of a wing and oriented along the spanwise direction to produce a body force in the streamwise direction. Force measurements show that the symmetrical actuator can effectively delay the flow separation on the wing at the wind speed up to and has a better control performance than that of the asymmetrical actuator. Particle image velocimetry experiments are carried out to identify the different control mechanisms between the two actuators and highlights how the induced airflows by the two plasma actuators interact with the boundary layer. The induced vortex by the symmetrical plasma actuator is found to be the key element for the better control performance.",54,1
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033747,"Presented is a method for the design of passenger aircraft families. Existing point-based methods found in the literature employ sequential approaches in which a single design solution is selected early and is then iteratively modified until all requirements are satisfied. The challenge with such approaches is that the design is driven toward a solution that, although promising to the optimizer, may be infeasible due to factors not considered by the models. The proposed method generates multiple solutions at the outset. Then, the infeasible solutions are discarded gradually through constraint satisfaction and set intersection. The method has been evaluated through a notional example of a three-member aircraft family design. The conclusion is that point-based design is still seen as preferable for incremental (conventional) designs based on a wealth of validated empirical methods, whereas the proposed approach, although resource-intensive, is seen as more suited to innovative designs.",54,1
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033875,"It is widely acknowledged that tracking the postbuckling response of structures made from thin plates can be problematical. Such difficulty is associated with highly nonlinear effects, including mode jumping, imperfection sensitivity, and their combined interactions. Two widely used techniques that are currently used involve path following and asymptotic expansion. The former is often implemented in commercial finite element codes but can prove unreliable at representing branch switching. The latter is a relatively quick technique due to its recursive linear nature but is only reliable in the vicinity of bifurcations. Due to the overall complex nonlinearity, analytical closed-form solutions do not exist for path following and exist rarely for quadratic asymptotic expansions where simple forms have been adopted. This paper presents an analytical-based approach that enables the efficient optimal design of “moderately deep” nonlinear postbuckling behavior of laminated composite plates under uniaxial or biaxial loading. It provides a closed-form solution that more reliably reflects a deeper postbuckling response than the state of the art. Subsequently, highly efficient postbuckling optimization is attributed to the newly derived closed-form solution and a recent two-level optimization framework.",54,1

However, for civil aviation safety-of-life applications, the sensors of an ATM system using GPS must meet the required navigation performance, especially integrity. According to a new ATM system requirement, the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) prediction system (RPS) is an essential element for predicting GPS service quality for a 72 h period. Many web-based RPSs have been developed and are operated by civil aviation organizations around the world. However, none can autonomously provide the GPS RAIM availability information to the new ATM system. Thus, this study develops an RPS that can be integrated with the new ATM system. Airport operators can obtain the forecast results directly from the ATM system for a specific flight-information region. The system integration is validated using three years of actual operation results of the new ATM system. An evaluation of its support for additional navigation satellite constellations is also made.",54,1
