An existing proposal to enhance the control of buoyancy in lighter-than-air aircraft is reviewed, and a new method of buoyancy control (the inflatable vacuum chamber) is proposed. The differences between the existing proposal and new proposal are highlighted, including the new possibility of an airship that lands vertically onto the ground without a mooring mast, a ground handling party, or a runway. Theory of lightweight stiff inflatable structures is discussed and a specific design and construction method is proposed. The design is optimized and confirmed elastically stable; design specifications are given. A typical operation cycle (including liftoff, flight, and touchdown) is detailed. An area of potential theoretical advancement is identified.",50,4

In the present study, the wind tunnel was assembled with perforated top/bottom walls, solid side walls, and four perforated walls. The focus was to investigate the effects of tunnel background noise on compressible convex-corner flows, which correspond to the upper control surface of an aircraft wing. External acoustic disturbance has a minor effect on the mean surface pressure distributions, including flow expansion and recompression near the corner. Higher peak pressure fluctuations, which are associated with shock excursion phenomena, are observed with more intense tunnel background noise, particularly for the flow with initial separated boundary layers.",50,4

The computations are made using isolated rotor and rotor–fuselage models. To demonstrate the effect of a fuselage, the shaft tilt angles remain identical for both configurations. A good correlation has been obtained with the present computational fluid dynamics/comprehensive structural dynamics method. It is observed that a rotor–fuselage model improves the correlation significantly in terms of magnitudes and phases of the airloads solution. All the blade–vortex interaction peaks are captured accurately, and the phase shift in the section normal forces improves significantly, with the inclusion of a fuselage. The sources of improvements are investigated, considering the vorticity distributions and induced velocity fields of a rotor. It is revealed that the upwash pattern due to a fuselage is not restricted locally but propagates to considerable portions of the disk. Numerical results indicate that the upwash is responsible to lift up vortices at the zone of interest for a reduced miss distance, which results in a stronger blade–vortex interaction for improved correlations.",50,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031834,"The design of a biomimetic micro air vehicle with flapping wings is an essential challenge in the military/civilian field to conduct various missions. The success of a micro-air-vehicle flight is strongly related to the maneuverability and sustainability of an unsteady aerodynamic performance of the flapping motion. Appropriate flapping kinematics need to be established that are amenable to various flight purposes under a fluctuating environment. In this research, kinematics of flapping motion are determined by the study of aerodynamic performance of a flapping airfoil for appropriate maneuverability and sustainability. The flapping motion of an airfoil is formulated by a combined sinusoidal plunging and pitching motion in various angles of the stroke plane. The optimization process is carried out to determine the efficient motions based on a well-defined surrogate model that is made from the results of two-dimensional computational-fluid-dynamics analysis. The kriging method and genetic algorithm are used for the kinematic-optimization problems. The optimization results present appropriate flapping motions for forward flight, hovering flight, and high-thrust flight, respectively. The numerical results of the optimized cases show how the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms efficiently maximize lift and thrust-force generation.",50,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031886,"The prediction of the magnitude of the pressure surge in aircraft fuel systems is important from the standpoint of designing systems that will not exceed the maximum surge pressure allowed and also to determine the limit pressure so that lightweight systems can be designed. Because aircraft refueling systems are relatively low pressure, the formation of gaseous products, cavitation, introduces severe nonlinearity not only in the form of dampened pressures but also in decreased propagation speed. The linear relation between the bulk modulus, pressure, and density that exists in high-pressure systems is made nonlinear by the formation of gases. This paper describes a simulation method for predicting the pressure surge in aircraft fuel systems that is suitable for engineering purposes. A model for gas formation has been developed. The dynamic simulation is a relatively fine, one-dimensional, discrete distribution of the fluid solved with MacCormack’s predictor corrector technique. Simulation results are compared to actual fuel rig tests. There is a step-by-step description of how the simulation model was tuned to correlate with the measured data. After this, some practical uses of the model, actual simulations used for fuel system design, are presented.",50,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031903,"A new method for airfoil shape optimization is presented, in which the airfoil shape is optimized not only for the best aerodynamic efficiency but also for the minimum structural weight. To relate the structural weight to the airfoil shape a series of methods are prescribed for initial sizing of the wingbox structure. Based on these methods, a “weight index” is defined. The airfoil weight index is a mathematical equation that relates the structural weight of the wingbox to the airfoil shape. The structural weight of a wingbox reduces by increasing the weight index of the airfoil. A set of multi-objective optimizations is performed to find the Pareto front of the airfoil drag and the weight index.",50,4

In this experiment, flat-plate wings with rectangular planforms of aspect ratios , 1, 1.5, and 3 and tapered planforms of , 0.5, and 0.25 were placed in the wind tunnel at a Reynolds numbers of . Angle-of-attack sweeps were performed at sideslip angles of , , , , 20 and , and the side force, yaw moment, and roll moment were measured. Although the side force and yaw moment coefficients ( and ) were typically negligible, the roll moment coefficient was found to increase linearly with angle of attack before stalling in a manner reminiscent of a lift curve. This “roll stall”, which has not previously been observed for micro-aerial-vehicle-type wings, is attributed to the upstream tip vortex creating an additional lift component due to its impact on the spanwise variation of effective angle of attack in addition to the force generated by its own low-pressure core. As the downstream tip vortex is convected away from the wing, a net moment is created. Computations of the roll-stability derivative indicate that a micro aerial vehicle in equilibrium flight conditions may experience magnitudes of at the upper limit of, or even above, the range of considered to represent good handling qualities in aircraft.",50,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031968,"Experimental studies were conducted by flapping a rigid rectangular wing with a mechanism that is capable of emulating complex insect wing kinematics, including figure-of-eight motions, in order to explore the fundamental unsteady flow on a flapping wing at micro-air-vehicle-scale Reynolds numbers. Force and moment measurements were obtained from a miniature six-component force transducer installed at the wing root. The wing was flapped in air and vacuum at the same frequency, and wing kinematics, and the resultant forces, were subtracted in order to obtain the pure aerodynamic forces. In the first part of this paper, the forces produced on the wing undergoing single-degree-of-freedom fixed-pitch pure flapping motions (no pitching or out-of-the-plane coning motions) were determined for a variety of pitch angles. The unsteady aerodynamic coefficients measured during these tests were almost six times the steady-state values measured in the wind tunnel. Flow visualization and particle image velocimetry tests were also conducted, which showed that the key reason for the force increase on the flapping wing is due to a strong leading-edge vortex for which the strength varied throughout the flapping cycle. In the second part of this paper, complete three-degree-of-freedom (flapping, pitching, and coning) insect wing kinematics were investigated for different pitching and coning variations. The aerodynamic forces obtained in these tests were compared with coefficients obtained from the single-degree-of-freedom flapping tests and wind-tunnel tests.",50,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032040,"As fuel efficiency becomes a greater concern in commercial aircraft design and operation it is important to gain a deeper understanding of energy use throughout an aircraft’s systems. To meet this need, a new methodology is being developed that proposes the use of exergy as a metric for mapping the energy flows throughout an aircraft at any required level of detail over a given flight. Exergy allows direct comparison of differing energy types and clearer interpretation of losses and availability. Time-variant application of exergy to vehicles, however, presents complexities, such as large data volumes, temporary exergy storage, exergy exchange between system and mass, and an inconsistent reference state. A software tool prototype is introduced to allow the management of an aircraft exergy map. To describe its use an unmanned aerial vehicle is evaluated. A turbojet study isolates the reference state problem and illustrates the need to use a moving, aircraft-fixed reference state. However, it is shown that this does not eliminate the problem entirely because of the existence of exergy storages.",50,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032044,"This comparative study is motivated by recent developments dealing with transport aircraft high-lift aerodynamics. Different than these developments Cartesian grids are used to achieve octree and omni-tree data structure. In this paper, the computation of complex flowfield is carried out using the cell-center finite volume method and dual-time stepping scheme. Based on the normal momentum equation a curvature-corrected symmetry technique has been developed to build the wall boundary treatment. A face-to-face algorithm is used in combination with the multizone technique, which can precisely establish the information exchange of flowfields in the interfaces among different zones. Compared with wind-tunnel experiments the above methods have been verified with two test cases involving, respectively, a takeoff configuration and a landing configuration. The focus is on the comparison of the octree and omni-tree data structure in Cartesian grid generation. The computed results indicate preliminarily that the omni-tree data structure is of higher efficiency, allows Cartesian grids to be adapted in an arbitrary manner, and offers the potential of a dramatic reduction of the total number of grids with the solution accuracy almost unaffected.",50,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032062,"In this study, an aerostructural analysis using a proper orthogonal decomposition with a neural network is proposed for accurate and efficient aerostructural wing design optimization using the reduced-order model. Because reduced-order-model basis weighting estimation has a limitation in that its robustness cannot be guaranteed by various design variables and wing deformation due to fluid structure interaction, this study employs the neural network, which is capable of perceiving the relationship between the input variables and reduced variables for the proper orthogonal decomposition to complement the defects. To construct the proper orthogonal decomposition with a neural network, the neural network is learned using pairs of design variables and reduced variables from snapshot data obtained from the aerostructural analysis. Because the proposed aerostructural analysis using a proper orthogonal decomposition with a neural network is applied to validation cases and its results are compared to those of the full-order analysis, it is investigated that the proposed analysis algorithm has the capability to accurately and efficiently predict the aerodynamic and structural performances of wings that are considered about wing deformation. Furthermore, because the design optimization problem minimizing the weight of a wing design is performed with the analysis algorithm, it is confirmed that it can be a more efficient design than a conventional design method using a second-order polynomial model, which consists of a greater number of experiment designs than the number of snapshots.",50,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032065,"This paper describes a practical system identification procedure for small, low-cost, fixed-wing unmanned aircraft. Physical size and cost restrictions limit the sensing capabilities of these vehicles. The procedure is demonstrated on an Ultra Stick 25e, therefore emphasizing a minimum complexity approach compatible with a low-cost inertial sensor. A linear model, obtained from the generic nonlinear equations of motion for aircraft, is used as a basis for system identification. This model is populated with results from a first principles analysis to form a baseline model. Flight experiments are designed using the baseline model and operational constraints to collect informative data. Parameters of the linear model are identified by fitting the model to frequency responses extracted from the data. The parameters are integrated into the nonlinear equations of motion, and both linear and nonlinear models are validated in the time domain. Verification of model accuracy is extended with a sensitivity and residual analysis.",50,4

A nonlinear trajectory-following logic is adopted to correct altitude loss and horizontal drift during the transition. By simulation, the proposed transition method shows better acceleration performance. The comparison of the induced drag shows that the vehicle should roll to resume fixed-wing lift as soon as its minimum level-flight speed is achieved to optimize its acceleration performance.",50,4

14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032083,"The dynamic response of an airfoil to microtab deployment has been studied in the University of California, Davis Aeronautical Wind Tunnel. Static tests were conducted at a Reynolds number of , whereas dynamic testing examined deploying microtabs under steady conditions and during simulated wind gusts. Experimental results are compared with two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational results generated using OVERFLOW2. Microtabs with a height equal to 1% of the airfoil chord are seen to produce a rapid change in the sectional lift coefficient sufficient to compensate for a 12% change in the freestream airspeed. The effect of tab deployment was modeled using a linear equation that related the lift force to the difference in surface pressure at 15% chord. The resulting function provided a usable approximation to the lift force during tab activation. Two modes of tab activation are examined: simultaneous deployment of all tabs along the airfoil span and sequential deployment of individual segments. The latter mode allowed the timing of tab activation to be matched more closely to the changing airspeed.",50,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032084,"The drive for ever more efficient aircraft structures stimulates the research to use the full potential of anisotropy of composite materials. The stiffness optimization of the upper and lower skins of a composite wing is demonstrated in this paper. The wing was optimized taking into consideration the mass, strength, buckling, aerodynamic twist, and aileron effectiveness. The elements of the in-plane and bending stiffness matrices and laminate thicknesses were used as design variables. Static aeroelastic analysis was performed using Nastran to find the responses of the structure and their sensitivities to the design variables. The results of aeroelastic finite element analysis were processed to create efficient structural approximations of the responses. The approximations were used by a gradient-based optimizer to update the design variables. The separable and continuous approximations in terms of the design variables allowed for the use of efficient parallel computing strategies, in which single or multimodal objective functions were minimized. The first numerical results for a generic wing confirmed a functional setup for multiload case stiffness optimizations with aeroelastic design responses. Stiffness-optimized unbalanced laminates demonstrated a clear advantage over balanced laminates for mass or aileron effectiveness optimizations, with constraints on strength and buckling.",50,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032096,"Computational modeling of ice accretion on a rotorcraft is an alternative and/or a complement for flight test in icing certification and ice protection system design. Although computational fluid dynamics solutions of helicopter flow have advanced in the last few years, icing simulations are rare and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none has modeled helicopter icing completely. In this work, a three-dimensional simulation of long-term in-flight ice accretion, accounting for rotor-fuselage quasi-steady interaction, is performed. For flow solution, the three-dimensional compressible turbulent Navier–Stokes equations are solved, with the rotor modeled as an actuator disk that imparts radial and azimuthal distributions of pressure rise and swirl to the flow field. The authors’ code FENSAP-ICE is used to solve the three-dimensional flow, impingement, and ice accretion. The flow solutions for a test case, at two forward speeds, are obtained and validated against published experimental results and then used to illustrate icing on the helicopter’s fuselage. Also, in this work, the effects of different parameters (such as forward speed, ambient temperature, droplet diameter, and liquid water content) on droplet impact, ice accretion, and the aerodynamic degradation of helicopter fuselage, were studied.",50,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032098,"The paper presents two possible ways of modeling wakes within an unstructured two-field potential flow formulation. It aims at avoiding the use of specialized mesh generators featuring the a priori imposition of wake cuts. Thus, by making possible the adoption of widely available general-purpose mesh generators, it gives way to an easier application of a potential formulation to complex configurations. A first approach generates a posteriori wake cuts within generic unstructured meshes, while an alternative method translates the potential discontinuity across the wake into a proper weak constraint on the flow velocity within the grid elements intersected, leaving them unchanged. A steady transonic trim evaluation and a couple of flutter analyses are shown to verify the effectiveness of both strategies, comparing their results with alternative numerical solutions.",50,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032127,"The ability to vary the geometry of a wing to adapt to different flight conditions can significantly improve the performance of an aircraft. However, the realization of any morphing concept will typically be accompanied by major challenges. Specifically, the geometrical constraints that are imposed by the shape of the wing and the magnitude of the aerodynamic and inertia loads make the usage of conventional mechanisms inefficient for morphing applications. This paper presents the design of a novel underactuated parallel mechanism, which addresses such concerns. This mechanism, which can be set up in a modular fashion, offers controlled motion in all six spatial degrees of freedom while providing multiple degrees of fault tolerance with only four actuators. The main feature of the design is the usage of active and passive linearly adjustable members to replace the structure of a conventional wing box. These members provide the necessary stiffness and load-bearing capabilities for the wing. With the exception of the skin no additional structure would be required, leading to a relatively light-weight design for the morphing wing. Additionally, an optimal motion control algorithm for minimum energy actuation is proposed based on the kinematics and statics of the mechanism. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed design and motion control is demonstrated through a simulation followed by the presentation of a multimodule prototype for a wing tip morphing application.",50,4

Characterization is accomplished using a force balance and flow visualization. The Gurney-flap lift increment due to a shift in the zero-lift angle of attack was observed to scale with that of the lift-curve slope for different aspect ratios. As the aspect ratio reduced, a Gurney flap of greater height was required to maximize aerodynamic efficiency. The dependence of aerodynamic parameters (zero-lift angle of attack, minimum drag coefficient, and lift-curve slope) on the Gurney flap’s height-to-chord ratio was also examined.",50,4

The closed-form relations for these ground-effect influence ratios were developed by correlating results obtained from numerical solutions to Prandtl’s lifting-line theory. Results show that these influence ratios are not unique functions of the ratio of wing height to wingspan, as is sometimes suggested in the literature.

22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032177,"A method for estimating the airspeed, angle of attack, and sideslip without using a conventional, pitot-static air data system is presented. The method relies on measurements from Global Positioning System, an inertial measurement unit, and a low-fidelity model of the aircraft’s dynamics, which are fused using two cascaded extended Kalman filters. In the cascaded architecture, the first filter uses information from the inertial measurement unit and Global Positioning System to estimate the aircraft’s absolute velocity and attitude. These estimates are used as the measurement updates for the second filter in which they are fused with the aircraft dynamics model to generate estimates of the airspeed, angle of attack and sideslip. Methods for dealing with the time and interstate correlation in the measurements coming from the first filter are discussed. Simulation and flight-test results of the method are presented. Simulation results show that the root mean square error of the airspeed estimate is less than . The nominal errors from the flight test on airspeed, angle of attack, and sideslip are less than , 2 deg, and 1 deg, respectively.

The simulations are performed either with a flat ground or with different modifications to the ground surface to trigger rapid vortex decay. The impact of environmental turbulence in terms of turbulent wind is taken into account, where wall-resolved and wall-modeled large-eddy simulation are performed for low- and high-Reynolds-number cases, respectively. To understand wake-vortex decay mechanisms in ground proximity, the interaction of primary and secondary vortices is carefully investigated. We find that vortex decay can be initiated at an earlier time and substantially accelerated with obstacles at the ground. We explain the fundamental vortex dynamics describing five characteristics of the phenomenon and quantify the decay. We demonstrate that similar effects can be achieved, employing relatively small plate lines as opposed to the original large block-shaped barriers.

The panel was designed for a compression loading configuration, a realistic load case for a typical aircraft skin-stiffened panel. The panel was integrally machined from a 2139 aluminum alloy plate and was tested in compression. The panel was loaded beyond buckling and strains, and out-of-plane displacements were extracted from 36 strain gages and one linear variable displacement transducer. A digital photogrammetric system was used to obtain full-field displacements and strains on the smooth (unstiffened) side of the panel. The experimental data were compared with the strains and out-of-plane deflections from a high-fidelity nonlinear finite element analysis. The test data indicated that the panel buckled at the linear elastic buckling eigenvalue predicted for the panel. The out-of-plane displacement measured by the digital photogrammetric system compared well both qualitatively and quantitatively with the nonlinear finite element solution in the postbuckling regime.
