These predictions are compared to the available test data as well as to one another. Both grid and parametric studies of the options available within each code are included. The grid studies look into not only blade grid density but also Cartesian and unstructured far-field grid computations and the use of adaptive mesh refinement. A study examining the impact of the hub on the performance predictions is also included. The results show that, in addition to blade-tip grid refinement, leading-edge and trailing-edge grid refinement are important to compute the hover performance. The dual-mesh methodology is shown to preserve the wake for a longer distance when compared to the fully unstructured methodology. This has some impact on the final wake structure. The presence of the hub is found to have a small impact on the final integrated performance parameters. However, there is a greater impact on the convergence rate of these performance parameters as well as the magnitude of the 4/rev time history characteristics. The final integrated performance results obtained from each solver using the “best” set of grid and input parameters are found to be comparable to one another.",55,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034137,"The Langtry–Menter transition model is used to predict the aerodynamic performance of three realistic helicopter and tiltrotor blades in hover: the XV-15 proprotor, the joint-service vertical takeoff/landing experimental rotor, and the S-76 conventional scaled rotor. The role of transition modeling in rotor hover predictions is investigated based on comparative studies using the full turbulence model and the transition model. The subsequent predicted transition phenomena are then validated with the experimental data. The focus of this study is to explore three major issues pertinent to rotor hover predictions: 1) the effect of transition modeling on the rotor aerodynamic prediction, 2) rotor prediction at high thrusts or collective angles, and 3) rotor flow characteristics and their influence on aerodynamic performance. Numerical computations indicate different impacts of the transition modeling on predicting the aerodynamic performance for conventional rotors and proprotors.",55,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034066,"The analysis of rotors in hover has always been a significant challenge. The presence of strong vortices underneath the rotor requires a large amount of grid points to properly capture the vorticity, and many time steps are required to reach a time-independent state. To bring the simulation cost to a more practical state for industry, a modified hybrid Navier–Stokes/free-wake method has been introduced, which successfully reduced grid count and simulation time by one order of magnitude compared to full Navier–Stokes simulations. In this hybrid method, Navier–Stokes and free-wake solvers are loosely coupled for fast convergence in hover. The S-76 model-scale blades with three tip designs were studied to assess current approaches. The proposed approaches showed reasonable-to-good correlation with measured figure of merit, thrust, and torque data. The effects of tip-design and tip-speed variations were captured well. The physical mechanisms of tip-design impact on hover performance were also studied.",55,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034112,"A new, hierarchical hybrid computational fluid dynamics–free wake method has been assessed for the S-76 rotor in hover. The computational fluid dynamics–free wake-based dual-solver approach addresses the industry needs for computational fluid dynamics accuracy at reduced costs for design and analysis. This solver is capable of modeling model multiple blades, rotors, and bodies, and it is not limited to a single rotor blade as in many dual-solver hybrid approaches. Hover predictions have been evaluated with three different blade-tip configurations, along with three different tip Mach numbers for a swept and tapered tip. The computational fluid dynamics–free wake simulations produced integrated performance coefficients comparable to or more accurate than those achieved by most full computational fluid dynamics with larger meshes or other hybrid methods. The hybrid approach provides cost savings and is within four counts of the experimental figure of merit and two counts of computational fluid dynamics alone results for the collective sweep performed. The use of this hybrid method significantly decreased computational time and cost with a reduced-size mesh costing 51.3% of a computational fluid dynamics model.",55,1

The effect of blade tip shape variation is studied for three tip shapes: rectangular, swept tapered, and swept tapered anhedral. The effect of tip Mach number is studied for the swept-tapered tip. Computed results include rotor performance, blade airloads, and tip-vortex strength and position. The performance predictions are compared against the test measurements and good agreement is obtained. Compared with the swept-tapered tip, the rectangular blade incurs compressibility losses near the tip. The addition of anhedral to the swept-tapered tip improves performance as a result of redistribution of thrust.",55,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034076,"Hover performance calculations are performed for a 9.34 ft, four-blade, Mach-scaled, S-76 rotor with an anhedral tip using different computational-fluid-dynamics approaches to assess the variability in predictions. Time-accurate Navier–Stokes calculations are performed using the High Performance Computing Modernization Program Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments Air Vehicles Helios software suite with OVERFLOW and FUN3D as near-body solvers, and the standalone OVERFLOW solver. Different modeling options exercised include structured and unstructured meshes for the blades, adaptive mesh refinement in the blade mesh, adaptive mesh refinement in the wake mesh, and inviscid and detached-eddy simulation modeling in the wake. Rotor performance, blade airloads, and wake geometry from the different calculations show consistent predictions. The agreement between computed figure of merit and test data is good at high-thrust conditions but only fair at lower thrust.",55,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034144,"This paper presents evidence on the ability of modern computational fluid dynamics methods to accurately predict hover performance of rotors with modest computer resources. The paper uses two well-studied blades, the S-76 main rotor blade and the XV-15 tiltrotor blade. The results are compared with experiments and show that the performance is well predicted. In addition, the employed computational fluid dynamics method was able to capture the effects of the tip Mach number, tip shape, blade aeroelasticity, and flow transition on the performance of the blade as well as on the wake structure and the rotor acoustics.",55,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034073,"The ability to predict and understand the influence of rotor tip shape on hovering rotor performance is critical to rotorcraft development. Comprehensive rotorcraft analysis methods are an efficient way to reduce the risk and cost associated with developing new rotor designs. In the modern design environment, these methods are ideal for efficiently traversing the design space in order to identify designs of interest suitable for more detailed analysis, testing, and optimization. In this paper, the ability of three distinctly different comprehensive rotorcraft methods (EHPIC, CHARM, and VTM) to predict the hover performance of a rotor with a variety of tip shapes is evaluated. The assessment indicates that good predictive fidelity is achieved for the cases considered, though dependence on airfoil data remains a limiting factor in the generality of the analysis results.",55,1

The rotor figure of merit is predicted over a range of blade collective angles, and computed skin frictions on the rotor surface are compared with the wind-tunnel experimental data. A grid resolution study is performed to investigate the impact of the mesh resolution on hover predictions using a baseline mesh and a refined mesh. The Langtry–Menter local correlation-based transition model is used to predict the skin friction and transition onset associated with the XV-15 rotor under the framework of both the Spalart–Allmaras one-equation turbulence model and Menter’s shear-stress transport two-equation model. Computational results show satisfactory predictions for the XV-15 hover performance and transition phenomena and offer an improved understanding of complicated rotor flow physics for the XV-15 proprotor.",55,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034346,"One of the bottlenecks for the recent increase in air traffic density is near the airport, where wake vortices, bounded by the terrain, could easily rebound into the landing corridor and remain there for a long period of time while maintaining their strength. The threat of near-ground wake vortex could be mitigated by the plate-line technology, which places a series of thin plates across the landing corridor before the runway; the technology was shown to significantly reduce the time it takes for wake vortex dissipation. The current investigation aims to better understand factors such as plate dimension and lateral position influences on the generation of secondary vortex structure and ultimately the dissipation rate of a wake vortex pair. It is found that the wake dissipation could be sped up further by optimizing the lateral position of the plate relative to the obstacle–vortex contact location, while the height of the plate could be significantly reduced without noticeably affecting the performance of the obstacle set.",55,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034390,"To characterize changed aircraft dynamics due to icing an incremental model extension ( model) is analytically derived, and its parameters are estimated. This model extension is formulated as a separate module in the aerodynamic part of the aircraft simulation and can be used in existing simulation models. Within a cooperation of DLR, German Aerospace Center and Embraer flight data of a light business jet with different ice accumulation cases are used to identify the parameters of a clean and a model describing icing effects. The model parameters are interpreted with respect to the aerodynamic degradation caused by icing. An analysis of different asymmetric icing cases is performed using the identified model. Trimmed flight conditions deliver information about the maximum expectable additional icing-induced moments and the necessary control surface deflections compensating the disturbance. The ability to cover various icing effects is shown by dynamic simulations reducing local icing effects similar to ice shedding situations in flight.",55,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034252,"A methodology is developed to efficiently, yet accurately, determine the uncertainty bounds of the bifurcation loci of nonlinear dynamic systems subjected to parametric variations. The chosen approach makes use of numerical continuation, higher-order singular-value decomposition, and surrogate modeling. The technique is demonstrated on a representative model of an aircraft undercarriage, where the effect of uncertainty in the structural parameters is propagated onto the prediction of the conditions for the onset of shimmy. Comparison with numerical integration results demonstrates the accuracy of the methodology.",55,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034308,"The development of vortical flow strongly changes the properties of motion-induced aerodynamic loads. Tests were performed in the Transonic Wind Tunnel Göttingen with a half-wing model of a lambda wing. A hydraulic actuator imposed pitch oscillations with amplitudes and frequencies relevant for aeroelastic analyses. Unsteady surface-pressure and flowfield measurements were performed. With increasing angle of attack, a leading-edge vortex emerges and moves inboard. The unsteady loads show a strong dependency on the effects of the vortical flow. For the pitching cases, the effects are lagging the motion. In the rear outboard part of the wing, the unsteady pressures are small, but the amplitude of the motion is high. Hence, a significant amount of energy—force integrated over motion—is transferred from the fluid to the motion. For a free motion or deformation of the wing, this would cause a destabilization. A significant effect of the vortical flow is the discrepancy between the position where it emerges and is affected, and the position (e.g., further outboard) where the flow may generate unsteady, potentially destabilizing loads.",55,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034369,"A methodology is described to couple unsteady aerodynamic loads with flexible bodies in multibody simulations. A representative civil jet aircraft aeroelastic model is used to evaluate the structural loads due to the combination of gust and ground loads. The implementation of unsteady aerodynamic loads is validated by comparing the results for the wing root bending moment and tip displacement with Nastran transient aeroelastic analyses for a series of gust lengths of a linear free–free aircraft model. The main objective of the paper is to prove that, with the implementation of a time domain formulation for the unsteady aerodynamic loads, a multibody simulation can be used to predict the aircraft aeroelastic loads that are comparable with traditional finite element-based methods. However, the use of a multibody simulation software offers the simulations to other maneuvers such as landings and the use of nonlinear and active structures.",55,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034340,"A load-bearing morphing skin concept to improve the aerodynamic performance of an aircraft wing is proposed. The concept uses a composite material morphing upper skin coupled to a typical aluminum wing structure. A three-step finite element analysis-based optimization scheme is developed using the minimization of the mass of the composite skin as the objective function, while ensuring it best fits the target morphed aerodynamic profiles. The optimization results are further simplified to ease manufacturing. A series of analytical validations are performed to ensure the structural integrity of the morphing skin as part of the original wing section subject to the design limit loads. Finally, the deformation of the skin is validated experimentally on a testbed model under design limit load and several morphing conditions. The experimental results show that skin deformations are in line with the finite element analysis predictions for both the design limit loads and the target morphed shapes. This validates that the finite element analysis-based optimization procedure developed here is appropriate for the design of a morphing wing section with active aerodynamic improvement capabilities, while preserving its structural integrity.",55,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034405,"Fueled by telecommunication needs and opportunities, there has been a recent push to develop aircraft that can provide long-endurance (days to weeks) persistent aerial coverage. These aircraft present a complicated systems engineering problem because of the multifaceted interaction between aerodynamics, structures, environmental effects, and engine, battery, and other component performance. Using geometric programming, models capturing the interaction between disciplines are used to analyze the feasible limits of solar-electric and gas-powered, long-endurance aircraft in seconds to a level of detail and speed not previously achieved in initial aircraft sizing and design. The results show that long-endurance, gas-powered aircraft are generally more robust to higher wind speeds than solar-powered aircraft but are limited in their endurance by the amount of fuel that they can carry. Although solar-electric-powered aircraft can theoretically fly for months, they are operationally limited by reduced solar flux during the winter and wind speeds at higher latitudes. A detailed trade study between gas-powered and solar-powered aircraft is performed to discover which architecture is best suited to meet a given set of requirements and what is the optimum size and endurance of that platform.",55,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034591,"The use of various modeling approaches for the numerical simulation of low-Reynolds-number flow past wings of finite span with leading-edge protuberances is studied at pre- and poststall operating conditions. Variants of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations (including transitional modeling) and detached-eddy simulations (involving different options for shielding the boundary layer from the detached-eddy simulation limiter), as well as a low-Reynolds-number correction, are considered. An assessment of the capabilities exhibited by these modeling approaches is carried out, based on detailed comparisons against whole-flowfield and aerodynamic force measurements in a wind tunnel, at a Reynolds number of for wings with aspect ratios of 1 and 1.5. The results show that the use of detached-eddy simulation with an improved description of the boundary layer is required to reproduce the flow physics accurately at prestall conditions, where separation and subsequent reattachment are observed. At poststall regimes, massive flow separation occurs, and a choice of conservative shielding produces the best outcome with detached-eddy simulation. In addition, the present experimental dataset provides valuable information toward understanding the passive stall control mechanism generated by the use of leading-edge tubercles and its application to low-aspect-ratio wings.",55,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034280,"For the nonlinear equations of motion of the nano air vehicle, including the gyroscopic coupling and countertorque generated by the propulsion system, a linear state-space model is developed for analyzing the effects of gyroscopic coupling and countertorque on the dynamic behavior of the nano air vehicle. By analyzing the trajectories of eigenvector components obtained by increasing the gyroscopic coupling, it is shown that the different modes of the nano air vehicle influence both the lateral and longitudinal variables, thereby losing the conventional characteristics of these modes. The investigation shows that the stability of the coupled phugoid and coupled Dutch roll modes are improved, whereas the stability of the coupled spiral, coupled roll subsidence, and coupled short-period modes are degraded with the enhancement of gyroscopic coupling. Concurrently, increasing the gyroscopic coupling increases the damping ratio of the coupled Dutch roll and coupled phugoid modes. In contrast to this, the gyroscopic coupling reduces the damping ratio of the coupled short-period mode. The frequency of the coupled phugoid and coupled short-period modes is also increased with the increment in the gyroscopic coupling. The analysis also indicates that the countertorque destabilizes the coupled spiral mode.",55,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034412,"A new model for in-flight ice accretion is presented for both rime and glaze conditions. The model is based on the local, exact solution of the unsteady Stefan problem for the temperature profiles within the ice layer in glaze conditions. The new model moves from Myers’s formulation, and it includes an unsteady description of the heat diffusion problem within the ice layer. Moreover, the local value of the air temperature outside the boundary layer is used to compute convective heat fluxes, in place of the constant freestream temperature value considered in Myers’s model. A source term is introduced to take into account mass transfer at the boundary separating rime and glaze regions. The model was implemented in the ice accretion software PoliMIce to perform numerical simulations of in-flight ice accretion over two-dimensional airfoils in both rime and glaze ice regimes. The open-source computational fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM was used to compute the aerodynamic flowfield and to reconstruct water droplet trajectories. Numerical results suggest that the modifications introduced with respect to the original Myers model improve significantly the accuracy of the predicted ice shapes for the considered test cases. The introduction of the local value of air temperature was found to be essential for the formation of the well-known two-horn ice shape, due to the occurrence of a local glaze to rime transition. The diverse contributions to the heat fluxes are discussed for both the proposed and the Myers models.",55,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034362,"As airspace becomes increasingly crowded, the need for next-generation traffic-advisory systems for pilots has become more crucial. To this end, a heads-up advisory display is developed within the Google Glass platform to assist pilots in the rapid location and identification of air traffic in their vicinity. The display is conceived as a proposed addition to existing traffic collision advisory systems, and the research seeks to determine if such assistive technology provides advantages in better detecting surrounding air traffic and reducing the risk of a collision. The display features a dynamically updating three-dimensional arrow that continuously guides the pilot’s eye toward oncoming traffic. The arrow updates its orientation in real time based on the relative head motion of the pilot, the motion of the pilot’s aircraft, and the location of the oncoming traffic. Pilot-in-the-loop testing and simulation runs are conducted to gauge the response times of participants tasked with visually acquiring intruding traffic. The results from testing show a significant improvement with the use of the assistive technology, with response-time reductions of over 60% observed in certain cases, notably in conditions in which traffic approaches from peripheral angles and when contaminated against the backdrop of ground clutter.",55,1

The U.S. Army’s rotorcraft comprehensive analysis system, known as RCAS, incorporates several analysis options, which are evaluated for their suitability at high advance ratios. RCAS predictions of performance, controls, airloads, and structural loads are compared against high advance ratio test data. RCAS modeling options of dynamic inflow, prescribed vortex wake, yawed flow corrections, and radial drag are evaluated. The strengths and weaknesses of the analysis options are highlighted. Rotor thrust and drag predictions are in good agreement with test data, with the addition of radial drag and yawed flow models. Dynamic inflow and prescribed vortex wake performance and loads predictions provide comparable correlation; however, dynamic inflow provides the most robust convergence without numerical issues in the reverse flow region. Yawed flow corrections improve normal force correlation at inboard stations but do not improve the structural load correlation at midspan.",55,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034490,"To ensure flight safety and expand the availability of high-altitude long-endurance aircraft, the present study suggests a novel procedure for determining mission success or failure under icing conditions. First, the ice accretion shapes during the climbing stage are predicted under icing conditions using the one-shot method. Then, the total ice mass on the high-altitude long-endurance aircraft surface and the resulting aerodynamic performance is numerically calculated. Subsequently, metamodels are constructed to correlate meteorological parameters and aerodynamic performance. Finally, the total required power to reach the mission altitude is compared with the onboard battery capacity to make a quantitative judgment about mission success. The proposed procedure is applied to the , with a maximum takeoff weight of 20 kg, developed by Korea Aerospace Research Institute. The results show that, when the liquid water content is and median volumetric droplet diameter is below , the battery margin falls below 10%, implying that particular attention is required when operating the aircraft under those meteorological conditions. Second, when using the one-shot method to predict ice shapes, the flight speed of aircraft and air density should be taken at a midpoint altitude between the ground and the highest altitude at which droplets exist. Finally, due to the low flight speed of aircraft, only a small number of water droplets adhere to the surface, and there is little convective heat transfer, resulting in rime ice shapes even at high temperatures.",55,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034213,"An innovative noise reduction method for supersonic exhaust jets was studied in a model-scale aircraft carrier environment. Acoustic measurements of model exhaust jets with (and without) distributed blowing, producing “fluidic inserts,” were performed. The model carrier environment consisted of a ground plane of adjustable distance below the jet, and a simulated jet blast deflector similar to those found in practice. The noise reduction of fluidic insert jets, above a ground plane, with steering of the “quiet planes” was examined with heat-simulated jets using near- and far-field pressure measurements. For jets exhausting over a ground plane, the fluidic inserts reduced the overall sound pressure level by 3–5 dB in the direction of maximum noise radiation. Upstream and sideline angles showed very little or no increase in sound level. Jets impinging on a modeled jet blast deflector were tested in addition to jets solely in the presence of a ground plane. The deflector resulted in downstream acoustic shielding and an increase in low-frequency noise. The region of maximum noise radiation for heat-simulated jets from nozzles with fluidic inserts impinging on the jet blast deflector was reduced in level by 4–7 dB. This region includes areas where carrier personnel are located.",55,1

Three Pitot-statics from two different commercial aircraft were computed-tomography scanned to determine their internal geometry, and a finite element acoustic study was performed to determine the variation between blocked and unblocked reflected acoustic waves when subjected to a sinusoidal input. To validate this, supporting experiments were conducted on the same tubes when subjected to a range of blockage types, including tape, predeceased insects, foam, and metal. Experimental and numerical results confirm acoustic detection of all tested blockages is feasible in a quiet environment, for both the total and static pressure measurements, but only if the pressure line forms a clean waveguide along its length. The frequency range for detection is specific to each of the two Pitot designs, but a common feature is that the blocked/unblocked variation diminishes as frequency is raised due to an increase of impedance with frequency. A current limitation of the method is that it has not yet been shown to be operable in flight.",55,1

The flow evolves in three stages during door opening, corresponding to closed-cavity flow, transitional flow, and (finally) open-cavity flow. The transition needs to be taken into account to design structures, as the bay wall loads are amplified, as well as the noise.

The proposed solver employs the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, modified appropriately by the artificial compressibility method and combined with the shear-stress transport turbulence model to account for the simulation of incompressible turbulent flows. Attention is mainly directed toward the assessment of the alternative, artificial compressibility methodology against such test cases because the majority of the workshop participants had implemented compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes codes with preconditioning matrices instead. To this end, the flow at various angles of attack over the DLR-F11 aircraft model is studied, whereas the obtained results are compared to the available experimental data as well as simulation results produced by reference solvers. A satisfactory agreement is reported, demonstrating the proposed methodology’s potential to accurately predict such complex flows and adapt to uncommon areas of use.",55,1
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034520,"The coaxial rotor has distinct advantages in hover performance and forward flight compared to a conventional isolated rotor. The viscous vortex particle approach based on the Lagrangian formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is a grid-free method suitable for capturing the vortex wake interaction over long distances. It is applied to evaluate performance, wake evolution, and loads in hover for a coaxial rotor system. A two-dimensional analysis is used to evaluate the effects of blade pitch angle and vertical separation distance. It is found that the interaction is significant only for distances of less than four to six chord lengths between the airfoils. In the coaxial rotor analysis, the performance is sensitive to the viscous drag coefficient of the airfoil. The rational function approximation of unsteady airfoil loads was used to reduce computational effort and improve accuracy of the calculations. The hover performance was predicted well with both the methods. Oscillations in thrust occurred primarily at blade passage azimuths. The rational function approximation calculations indicated a reduction in the magnitude of the thrust oscillations compared to the vortex panel method.",55,1
