1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032864,"The Second AIAA CFD High-Lift Prediction Workshop was held in San Diego, California in June 2013. The goals of the workshop continued in the tradition of the first high-lift workshop: to assess the numerical prediction capability of current-generation computational fluid dynamics technology for swept, medium-/high-aspect-ratio wings in landing/takeoff (high-lift) configurations. This workshop analyzed the flow over the DLR-F11 model in landing configuration at two different Reynolds numbers. Twenty-six participants submitted a total of 48 data sets of computational fluid dynamics results. A variety of grid systems (both structured and unstructured) were used. Trends due to grid density and Reynolds number were analyzed, and effects of support brackets were also included. This paper analyzes the combined results from all workshop participants. Comparisons with experimental data are made. A statistical summary of the computational fluid dynamics results is also included.",52,4

Computations are performed for the grid convergence study using the configuration without any slat tracks and flap track fairings on a series of multi-block structured grids and a series of unstructured grids provided by the High Lift Prediction Workshop committee. In this paper, the following are mainly discussed: 1) grid convergence verification study of the turbulence models using a two-dimensional bump case, 2) grid convergence studies for Spalart–Allmaras and shear stress transport turbulence models using UPACS, 3) change of grid convergence and predicted flow fields with and without a nonlinear quadratic constitutive relation model for Spalart–Allmaras and shear stress transport turbulence models using UPACS including evaluation at higher angles of attack, and 4) comparison studies using different solvers UPACS and TAS on different grid systems with and without the quadratic constitutive relation model for the Spalart–Allmaras model.",52,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032899,"The results presented at the Second AIAA High-Lift Prediction Workshop, using the flow-solver Edge, are summarized for the DLR, German Aerospace Center F11 model. A comparative study of the results, using three turbulence models, is carried out, including the Spalart–Allmaras model, an explicit algebraic Reynolds-stress model, and a curvature correction to the explicit algebraic Reynolds-stress model. The comparisons include a grid-convergence study on a simplified model without slat- and flap-track fairings, and polar calculations including the fairings. The grid-convergence study shows relatively small differences due to different grid resolution and turbulence models, but the differences are larger than those obtained in the first workshop for the NASA trap wing. The prediction has fairly large discrepancies from experimental measurements at low Reynolds numbers for which the computations were carried out assuming fully turbulent flow. The explicit algebraic Reynolds-stress model (with or without curvature correction) tends to exaggerate flow separation and to underpredict the lift, as compared to the experiment. The Spalart–Allmaras model, on the other hand, overpredicts the lift at higher incidences. At the higher Reynolds number, the predictions agree well with the experimental measurements for different turbulence models. The curvature correction to the explicit algebraic Reynolds-stress model has an insignificant effect on the computed results in comparison with the explicit algebraic Reynolds-stress-model predictions.",52,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033143,"Numerical investigations of the DLR F11 high-lift configuration from the 2nd AIAA High-Lift Prediction Workshop are performed with the in-house solver MFlow. The solver is based on a cell-centered finite-volume method and is capable of handling various element types. Hexahedral grids and hybrid grids are used in the simulations. Grid-convergence properties, polar line, and pressure distributions are analyzed and compared with experimental data. A nearly linear convergence property is achieved with grid refinement for configuration 2, which is the most simplified configuration of the experiment model. When including slat and flap brackets (configuration 4), results are improved compared to the simplified configuration. However, delayed stall and larger maximum lift coefficient compared with experiment are found for high-Reynolds-number computations. The rotation correction of Spalart–Allmaras model does not lead to obvious improvement at high angles of attack. The effects of Reynolds number are qualitatively captured by the simulations. The inclusion of pressure-tube bundles causes loss of lift near stall and has little influence on predictions at lower angles of attack. The solver shows good agreement with experiment at lower angles of attack, but more attention is needed at angles of attack near and beyond stall.",52,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033042,"Simulation results for the second AIAA CFD High-Lift Prediction Workshop using the unstructured computational fluid dynamics code NSU3D are presented. The solution algorithms employed in NSU3D for this study are described along with examples of convergence history and computational cost. The geometry used for the simulation consists of the DLR-F11 wing–body with high-lift system deployed in a landing configuration. This geometry is representative of a modern transport aircraft high-lift system that has been tested experimentally over a suitable Reynolds number range. Results are presented from two sets of computational studies, the first performed at the University of Wyoming using standard workshop unstructured meshes, and the second performed at Bombardier Aerospace using in-house-generated meshes. In both cases, results are presented for two different turbulence models, allowing an assessment of the sensitivity of the results to grid densities, grid types, and turbulence models. Results consist of computed force and moment coefficients across a range of angles of attack and for two different Reynolds numbers, as well as surface pressure profiles and off-body velocity profiles, all of which are compared with experimental data. The results compare favorably with experimental data and generally fall within the standard deviation of the workshop collective results. Computations using the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model tend to overpredict the maximum lift value and incidence, while results using the model tend to underpredict the maximum lift value. The best agreement in terms of force coefficients is observed with the turbulence model using the Bombardier internally generated meshes.",52,4

A grid-convergence study is performed for the geometry with the slat and flap brackets excluded. The influence of including the brackets in the computational geometry is considered, and the effects of varying Reynolds number are analyzed for the brackets-on configuration. An optional case for the workshop, but a focus of this paper, is the inclusion of laminar–turbulent transition in the solutions. Two computational-fluid-dynamics-compatible transition models are used for the analysis, and their behaviors are discussed. A turbulence-model-verification study, which was also an optional case for the workshop, is included.",52,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033192,"Contributions of the unstructured Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes code FUN3D to the 2nd AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics High-Lift Prediction Workshop are described, and detailed comparisons are made with experimental data. Using workshop-supplied grids, FUN3D results for the simplified high-lift configuration are compared with results from the structured code CFL3D. Using the same turbulence model, both codes compare reasonably well in terms of total forces and moment, and the maximum lift is similarly over-predicted for both codes compared to experiment. By including more representative geometry features such as slat and flap support brackets and slat pressure tube bundles, FUN3D captures the general effects of the Reynolds number variation, but under-predicts maximum lift on workshop-supplied grids in comparison with the experimental data due to excessive separation. However, when output-based, off-body grid adaptation in FUN3D is employed, results improve considerably. In particular, when the geometry includes both brackets and the pressure tube bundles, grid adaptation results in a more accurate prediction of lift near stall in comparison with the wind-tunnel data. Furthermore, a rotation-corrected turbulence model shows improved pressure predictions on the outboard span when using adapted grids.",52,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033164,"Numerical prediction of the aerodynamic properties of high-lift configurations has become an important topic for the computational fluid dynamics community in the last years. The present paper shows and discusses a numerical study of the DLR-F11 high-lift configuration that was used as a model reference in the Second High-Lift Prediction Workshop, organized by the AIAA in 2013. Case 1 of the workshop was simulated with the commercial software ANSYS Fluent v14.5, using the Spalart–Allmaras (fully turbulent Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes) model. Numerical results showed good agreement for angles of attack lower than 18 deg; however, above this value, simulations were not accurate enough near to . To study the influence of the turbulence model in the dynamics of the flow and the numerical prediction of the aerodynamic properties near to , the original grids were adapted and a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation model (detached-eddy simulation based on Spalart–Allmaras) was used. Numerical results for the detached-eddy simulation showed a small change in the prediction of the aerodynamic properties near to , as well as improved vorticity resolution in the wake.",52,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033219,"This paper presents the results of the computational-fluid-dynamics code XFlow for the test case proposed in the 2nd High-Lift Prediction Workshop. The target of this international workshop is to assess the accuracy of numerical predictions provided by a wide selection of computational-fluid-dynamics codes and applied to the aeronautical industry. It deals with a full aircraft in high-lift configuration with unstowed flap and slat, including slat tracks, flap track fairings, and slat pressure tube bundles. XFlow is a particle-based kinetic solver, based on the lattice Boltzmann method. It is well suited for such low-speed flows because the standard lattice Boltzmann method is limited to low Mach number. It employs large-eddy simulation turbulence modeling with the wall-adapting local eddy model, coupled with a generalized law of the wall to model the boundary-layer prediction. Traditional computational-fluid-dynamics software requires a time-consuming meshing process that is prone to errors, which significantly affects the mesh quality and thus the outcome of a simulation. Furthermore, the complex geometries such as elements in small gaps add an extra complication to generate the mesh. In contrast, the method employed by XFlow avoids the traditional meshing process using an octree structure, with spatial refinement related by a factor of 2 based on the input geometry. The discretization stage is strongly accelerated, thus reducing engineering costs and complex geometry computations are affordable in a straightforward way. The research presented in this paper starts with a grid validation study (case 1) with the DLR F11 geometry in configuration 2. Because the lattice Boltzmann method approach used by XFlow simplifies the integration of geometrical details, the full polar characteristic is directly investigated with configuration 5 (case 3) that includes the actual model configuration on the aerodynamic performances. The configuration 5 geometry includes slat tracks and flap track fairings, as well as slat pressure tube bundles. This is the highest-fidelity geometry in comparison with wind-tunnel testing. This study is conducted for both low- and high-Reynolds-number conditions, 1.35 and 15.1 million, respectively. In addition, the study focuses on the poststall region and the influence of geometrical details on turbulence and flow patterns. The interest for the poststall region is justified by the lack of consistency in the stall prediction found during the 2nd AIAA High-Lift Prediction Workshop by all the participants.",52,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032796,"Given the importance of stakeholder considerations to the aircraft’s overall mission and lifecycle performance, this work examines how stakeholder requirements are currently incorporated into the aircraft design process. A case study within an aircraft design firm found that human factors specialists are designated to address specific stakeholder considerations within the design process. This research explores how the perspectives of these specialists are integrated into aircraft design teams. Accounts from 25 semistructured interviews were analyzed using qualitative data analysis techniques. The results identify differences between the integration of stakeholder considerations within the pilot compartment group compared to other design groups. These differences can be described through six conditions related to group structure and goals, approaches to cross-disciplinary work, and shared language and mediums of translation among disciplines. These results highlight how to promote the integration of stakeholder concerns in complex systems design through the structure of design teams and groups, their goals, their resources, the choice of team members, and training for future and current design team members.",52,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032847,"Air traffic controller workload is considered to be a limiting factor to air traffic growth. Previous research introduced the static solution space approach to assess the difficulty of aircraft merging tasks. In this paper the dynamic, tangent-based solution space will be introduced that includes the future trajectory intent of all aircraft. Metrics derived from the solution space, together with common metrics, were tested for correlations with controller workload. An experiment has been conducted where subjects were required to line up all aircraft in a sector towards a certain waypoint, while periodically rating their workload. High correlations were found between several solution space related metrics and subjective workload ratings. In contrast to the number of aircraft metric, which had the highest correlation with workload, the dynamic solution space may allow for controller workload prediction in real-time.",52,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032853,"Targeted experiments in parallel with a systematic computational-fluid-dynamics analysis were performed for a micro-air-vehicle-scale rigid flapping wing in forward flight. Two-component time-resolved particle-image-velocimetry measurements were performed in an open-circuit wind tunnel on a wing undergoing pure flap-wing kinematics at a fixed wing-pitch angle. Chordwise velocity fields were obtained at equally spaced spanwise sections along the wing (30 to 90% span) at two instants during the flap cycle (middownstroke and midupstroke) for the reference Reynolds numbers of 15,000. The flowfield measurements were used for the validation of the three-dimensional computational-fluid-dynamics model. The computational-fluid-dynamics analysis used a compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver to resolve the complex, highly vortical, three-dimensional flow. The objectives of the combined efforts were to understand the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms and their relation to force production on a rigid wing undergoing an avian-type flapping motion. Overall, the computational-fluid-dynamics results showed good agreement with the experimental data for resolution of the overall highly unsteady and vortical flowfield. A control-volume approach used to calculate the strength of the leading-edge vortex from the particle-image-velocimetry measurements and from the computational-fluid-dynamics-generated flowfields showed comparable results. A hybrid momentum-based method was used to estimate the sectional vertical force coefficient from the particle-image-velocimetry-measured flowfield, which agreed well with the computational-fluid-dynamics force prediction over a range of flapping frequencies and wing-pitch angles. In general, it was observed that the flow over the wing was highly susceptible to changes in induced angle of attack resulting from the flapping motion and variations in reduced frequency, which manifested in the predicted airloads. Based on the computational analysis, the spanwise flow component was not significant, except near the wing tip, and therefore most of the vertical force and propulsive thrust produced could be explained using the magnitude and direction of the sectional lift and drag forces acting on the wing. For the present wing kinematics, most of the upward vertical force was produced during the downstroke and positive propulsive thrust during the upstroke, which shows the need for appropriate temporal and spanwise pitch modulation of the wing along with flapping to produce positive vertical force and propulsive thrust during the entire flap cycle.",52,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032859,"Propeller optimization by means of calculus of variations is addressed in this paper. A procedure for deriving the Euler–Lagrange equations for both unconstrained and constrained propeller blade-twist optimization is presented. This same procedure can be followed to optimize other geometric parameters, but blade twist is considered here to investigate the feasibility of a variable-twist propeller blade. Results from unconstrained twist optimization show that, regardless of the operating condition (takeoff, climb, or cruise), the maximum efficiency occurs at significantly lower power coefficients than what a propeller will be required to absorb. Constrained optimization supports this observation by showing that, for each operating condition, a power constraint lowers the propeller efficiency. Twist distributions obtained from constrained optimization for each of the three operating conditions differ significantly from one another, but it is shown that the effect on performance is insignificant. This leads to the conclusion that a variable-twist propeller would not be beneficial for a typical aircraft mission. For the case of a loiter–dash-type mission profile, however, analysis shows that a variable-twist propeller blade is indeed feasible.",52,4

It predicted a variety of basic cases reasonably well, including secondary flow in a supersonic rectangular duct. One- and two-equation turbulence models that employ the Boussinesq constitutive relation were unable to predict this secondary flow accurately because it is driven by normal turbulent-stress differences. For the NASA trapezoidal wing at high angles of attack, the WilcoxRSM-w2006 model predicted lower maximum lift than the experiment, similar to the results of a two-equation model.",52,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032865,"Aircraft flight generates vortices that induce nonuniform wind distribution in their wake. A trailing/follower aircraft will experience induced wind components and gradients with various magnitudes and directions, depending on its location relative to the leader. This paper explores two methods of determining the relative location for optimum formation flight, termed the sweet spot. The relative location with the highest lift-to-drag ratio on the follower is denoted as the static sweet spot. In the second method, the trail aircraft is trimmed by adjusting the thrust and control surfaces to maintain its commanded position relative to the lead. The relative location requiring the least thrust is then assigned as the dynamic sweet spot. The results showed that, depending on the trail aircraft size, the static sweet spot might differ from the dynamic sweet spot. The effect of the leader weight and follower size on both static and dynamic sweet spot was also studied. It was discovered that the static and dynamic sweet-spot location changed when the size of the trail aircraft was modified. It was also observed that the static sweet spot remained the same but the dynamic sweet spot changed when the lead aircraft weight was modified.",52,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032807,"Numerical simulations are performed to study the effect of freestream turbulence on small-amplitude limit-cycle oscillations of an airfoil at transitional Reynolds numbers. A one-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic model was coupled with the National Research Council Canada in-house computational-fluid-dynamics code INSflow to perform unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations for flows around a rigid NACA 0012 airfoil in free-to-rotate conditions. Without coupling a transition model, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations based on the commonly used shear-stress-transport turbulence model could not capture the limit-cycle oscillations. This was expected because it had been previously shown that the limit-cycle oscillations were fed by negative aerodynamic damping due to laminar boundary-layer separation. A correlation-based transition model was then implemented in the code and applied to investigate the turbulence effects. The computed results confirmed qualitatively the experimental observations of the turbulence effects on the limit-cycle oscillations by varying the values of the turbulence intensity and length scale. It was observed that the limit-cycle oscillations were more sensitive to the turbulence intensity than to the latter. In general, the freestream turbulence suppressed the limit-cycle oscillations. The pitch amplitude became smaller when the freestream turbulence intensity was increased, which was qualitatively in good agreement with experimental results. The limit-cycle oscillations could not be sustained when the input freestream turbulence level reached around 1.25%. An examination of the unsteady flowfield revealed that the freestream turbulence affected the location of the separation points and suppressed the laminar–turbulent transition process.",52,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032872,"In reality, all structures exhibit some degree of nonlinearity; however, in many cases, its effects are negligible to the overall structural response and it is common to treat them as such in analysis and design optimization. Due in large part to this practice, severe consequences and structural failures may arise when this nonlinearity cannot be neglected. Currently, this occurs with increasing frequency as designers continue to explore innovative aircraft concepts that push the limits of existing design tools and industry standards. In this research, such a case is investigated where geometrically nonlinear effects result from an elevated temperature environment. The thermoelastic response of characteristic aerospace structures is investigated by comparison of linear and nonlinear analysis results. Results indicate that geometric nonlinearity, which manifests as stress stiffening behavior and deformation-dependent load contributions, plays a significant factor in properly predicting the structural response for structures found in modern military aircraft with embedded engines. In addition, parametric studies present the influence of geometry parameters and boundary fixivity, or how components are attached to adjoining structures, on the nonlinearity in order to identify features that make it critical. Based on these observations, some guidelines regarding when geometric nonlinearity should be included in the structural analysis of thermally loaded structures are provided. These guidelines are useful to the structural analyst or designer faced with the analysis of components in a thermal environment due to engine heat, aerodynamic effects, or other sources.",52,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032876,"As part of the Collaborative Research Center 880, preliminary aircraft design activities are carried out for a new class of low-noise cruise-efficient short takeoff and landing (CESTOL) transport aircraft. A corresponding aircraft is quite different from a state-of-the-art commercial aircraft because of the use of a high-lift system with active flow control. The fact that new technologies are not sufficiently understood yet in combination with the assumption of common design data and the use of classical calculation methods expresses itself in uncertainties that are of epistemic character. The robustness of a deterministic CESTOL aircraft design toward parameters such as the necessary engine thrust, direct operating costs, and the maximum takeoff and landing distances is investigated here concerning the mentioned uncertainties. For this purpose, a stochastic description of parameter variations of the design is formulated. Stochastic quantities are computed by Monte Carlo sampling to rate the robustness. A distributed component-based software implementation is used to perform the Monte Carlo sampling. The software system is installed on a Linux cluster with several multi-CPU computers; a deterministic sample is simulated through the design program PrADO.",52,4
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032856,"The paper deals with the propagation of uncertainty in input parameters through the aircraft model in clean cruise configuration triggered by the elevator pulse. Assuming aerodynamic coefficients as random variables and processes, the evolution of uncertainties in the aircraft state is estimated with the help of efficient nonintrusive procedures—stochastic collocation and the nonintrusive Galerkin approaches, here contrasted to the slow convergent Monte Carlo integration. These numerical methods are implemented by using the flight simulator in a black-box manner. In this way, the set of samples of aircraft states is simply obtained by solving the corresponding systems of deterministic ordinary differential equations. Additionally, the paper provides the variance-based sensitivity analysis of a flight model carried out with the help of the polynomial-chaos approach.",52,4
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032768,"A time-course force measurement and time-resolved particle image velocimetry study were conducted to investigate the unsteady characteristics of an insect wing. In most cases, the tendencies of the aerodynamic forces in the stroke phase were extremely similar to the stroke velocity profiles, which indicated the appositeness of the steady aerodynamic model. The time-course forces showed that the wing–wake interaction appeared in temporally and spatially restricted sections right after the stroke reversal. The time-resolved particle image velocimetry taken near the stroke reversal demonstrated the vortex-dominated flowfields including the leading-edge vortex and the trailing-edge vortices. This was in contrast to the middle of the stroke, which only had a stable leading-edge vortex. The results showed that the unsteadiness was highly associated with the trailing-edge vortex structures. In particular, the wing–wake interaction were substantially influenced by the behavior of the number 2 trailing-edge vortex, which became the element of the counter-rotating vortex pair. The leading-edge vortex of the next stroke was rarely connected to such unsteadiness. This finding implies that the wing kinematics that determines the characteristics of the trailing-edge vortices were the key to the unsteadiness and the wing–wake interaction on the flapping wing.",52,4
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032854,"The lens of exergy is used to investigate a wingtip vortex in the near wake over a range of angles of attack. Exergy is the measure of thermodynamically “available” energy as determined through the more discriminating second law of thermodynamics. Experiments were conducted in a water tunnel at Institute of Aerospace Systems at Aachen. The data were taken three chord lengths downstream in the Trefftz plane of an aspect ratio 5 Clark-Y wing with a square-edged wing tip using particle image velocimetry. Intuitively, the minimum available energy state is expected to correspond to the maximum lift-to-drag ratio angle of attack. This, however, is not the case here. Most interestingly, although only two-dimensional Trefftz plane data were used to obtain the exergy distribution across the individual wing-tip vortices, the crossover point for the out-of-plane change from wakelike to jetlike wing-tip vortex core axial flow (indicating the peak lift-to-drag ratio) is identified by the in-plane exergy distribution. This crossover point is not identifiable in the evaluation of any other characteristics calculated from in-plane quantities. Consequently, the exergy method holds promise as a metric for the improvement of aircraft performance through the reduction of lift-induced drag.",52,4
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032909,"The frequency of aircraft encountering the wake of other aircraft is analyzed for given aircraft, movement, and meteorological data. The method considers the descent and decay of wake vortices for a given stratification and turbulence-kinetic-energy dissipation rate, and the advection with ambient horizontal and vertical wind. An encounter is characterized in this study by the distance between the position of a follower aircraft and the centerline of a wake vortex behind the vortex generator, and by the wake-induced lift forces or roll moments on the encountering aircraft. A linear model is used for an efficient identification of potential wake-vortex encounters for all flight segments in dense traffic regions. The method is applied to radar-observed traffic over North America in 46 days in 2010/2011, and validated against pilot-reported wake encounters and automated in situ turbulence reports. Most upper-level encounters are found for medium-size aircraft on nearly parallel flight routes during descent. En route encounters of wakes from heavy aircraft flying 1000 ft higher occur relatively rarely. The frequency of wake-vortex encounters increases with the square of air-traffic density.",52,4

A 50th percentile male occupant, exposed to shock conditions characterized by sink rates varying from 5 to , was considered. The compliance effects were examined by comparing the response of a multiple degree-of-freedom biodynamic lumped-parameter model derived from the response of a Hybrid II anthropomorphic test dummy representing a compliant-occupant model to the response of an equivalent rigid-occupant model under the same shock conditions. An experimentally validated nonlinear mathematical model of a magnetorheological energy absorber was integrated with both the compliant and rigid models of the occupants. In addition, three different control techniques were investigated based on controlling the onset of magnetorheological-energy-absorber stroking load: constant stroking-load control, terminal trajectory control, and optimal control. The internal damping of a compliant occupant proved to be a crucial parameter in determining the biodynamic response for all control techniques. An assessment of the potential of injury was conducted based on the established injury criteria for compliant occupants to evaluate the applicability of the control techniques.",52,4

It is desired to locate the best position of lightening holes, truss/cross-bracing, etc. A variety of aeroelastic metrics are isolated for each of these problems: elastic wing compliance under trim loads and taxi loads, stress distribution, and crushing loads. Aileron effectiveness under a constant roll rate is considered as are dynamic metrics: natural vibration frequency and flutter. This approach helps uncover the relationship between topology and aeroelasticity in subsonic transport wings and can therefore aid in understanding the complex aircraft design process that must eventually consider all these metrics and load cases simultaneously.",52,4
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032912,"Freeplay in aircraft control-surface actuators is a common source of nonlinearity that can cause undesirable aeroelastic phenomena, and as a consequence, certification authorities place strict limits on the size of the deadband gaps of actuators. In recent years, many authors have worked on determining the effects of freeplay on the dynamic behavior of aeroelastic systems; these efforts have yielded significant improvements in the understanding of the phenomena but have concentrated on simple models. Investigations of industry-relevant aeroelastic models of complete aircraft with freeplay in the actuators have been much rarer, with the main difficulty being the selection of an appropriate modal basis that can represent the full range of possible dynamic phenomena. This work presents a novel implementation of the residual vectors approach to create consistent and numerically stable reduced-order models suitable for industrial-standard aeroelastic models of aircraft. The methodology relies on the piecewise linear nature of freeplay to create a single reduction basis that represents the dynamics of the system both inside and outside the freeplay deadband gap. The method is demonstrated on an Embraer generic test-bench aircraft, showing that the resulting reduced-order model is efficient and effective. Nonlinear analysis is carried out using equivalent linearization as well as time integrations of the full nonlinear system. It is shown that, although equivalent linearization is an indispensable tool for a preliminary mapping of the main aeroelastic instabilities, the time-integration-based nonlinear analysis is an essential complementary tool to confirm the characteristics of the system behavior.",52,4
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032925,"The objective of this work was to highlight modeling considerations for estimating the required static-pressure-error corrections using computational fluid dynamics. This work was performed to complement the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School activities that used a T-38C aircraft with a previously untested Pitot-static system. Before the flight test, it is highly desirable to have an estimate of how any modifications will affect sensor performance, and to possess the capability to explain any discrepancies from previous test programs. Estimates of this kind are only obtainable via wind-tunnel tests or through modeling and simulation. This work presents the computational fluid dynamics requirements and methodologies needed to estimate the static-pressure-error correction of a T-38C in the subsonic, transonic, and low supersonic regimes. Estimates are validated with flight-test results, and proposed solutions for further reduction of static-pressure error via modifications to the flight-tested Pitot-static-probe geometry are included.",52,4
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032924,"A three-component phenomenological breakdown of spurious pressure drag in computational fluid dynamics is derived, following a far-field formulation. The study is purposely restricted to solutions to the Euler equations, in which the spurious drag, also extant in viscous simulations, can best be detected and analyzed. The matter of far-field spurious-drag elimination, which must indeed be handled differently in viscous flow and in inviscid flow, is outside its scope. Each of the three spurious components is produced through a different process. The first two components, already identified in the past, are of an irreversible thermodynamic nature. The first one is related to vorticity normal to the velocity, as it appears in Crocco’s relation. The second one is concomitant with destruction of vorticity parallel to the velocity. The third component, of a reversible nature, is purely due to the effect of the far-field boundary condition. It exists in two-dimensional flow as well as in three-dimensional flow, in which it is shown that it must be negative, while positive in two dimensions.",52,4
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032801,"A generic waverider-type hypersonic aircraft that undergoes an ascent trajectory has been modeled using a first-principles reduced-order model. Two types of operability limits are added that represent boundaries on the aircraft trajectory map (of vehicle altitude versus Mach number). These boundaries are associated with engine unstart and ram–scram transition. The predicted unstart boundary is to be avoided; the ram–scram transition is a condition through which the aircraft must fly, but it is useful for the control system to know when this transition is approached to account for possible sudden changes in thrust and moments. The model shows that unstart occurs if the aircraft flies too high, too slow, or at too great of an acceleration. The unstart limit can be avoided by selecting a trajectory having sufficiently large dynamic pressure or a low vehicle acceleration. Optimizing these factors avoids an excessive value of the fuel–air ratio that is required for trim. The model also identifies an engine inlet geometry that avoids unstart. To assess the model, the computed results are compared to some available experiments.",52,4
