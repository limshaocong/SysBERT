1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034440,"Computational studies were conducted in order to gain an understanding and to quantify the impact of the model support system and aeroelastic wing deformation on the Common Research Model at subsonic inflow conditions at . Comparisons between results obtained in the European Transonic Windtunnel and from simulations using TAU reveal the extent of the modeling error introduced by neglecting the support structure. RANS simulations with and without the support system show that it has a near-field effect on the model’s rear fuselage, significantly altering the pressure field and thereby impacting the force coefficients, most significantly drag and pitching moment. Aeroelastic wing deformation was also included in the investigation, showing non-negligible impact on the forces. The inclusion of the support system and wing deformation, as well as the use of advanced turbulence models, was shown to promise considerable error reduction potential in comparative studies between wind tunnel and simulation data.",55,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034712,"In this paper, the aeromechanics of a cycloidal rotor (or cyclorotor) is investigated to understand the effect of blade flexibility on the performance of the rotor in hover. Toward this, experiments are conducted on cyclorotors using moderately and highly flexible blades. These studies show that, with increasing blade flexibility, the rotor thrust decreases; whereas the power consumption increases, leading to a significant drop in power loading (thrust/power). To investigate these phenomena, a coupled aeroelastic model of cyclorotor is developed by coupling an unsteady aerodynamics model with a beam-based structural model and is systematically validated with experimental results. The aerodynamic model contains rigorous modeling of various physics behind the operation of the cyclorotor, such as the nonlinear dynamic virtual camber, the effect of near and shed wakes, and the leading-edge vortex. In comparison with a second-order nonlinear structural model, inclusion of a geometrically exact structural model proves to be essential in accurate prediction of rotor deflections and performance. Based on a systematic analysis performed using the validated model, it is observed that the large torsional deflections of the blades are a key reason for the drop in thrust. The torsional deflections are mainly produced by centrifugal force and nonlinear moments due to bending curvatures.",55,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034693,"The blade-tip vortex of a rotating and pitching DSA-9A blade was investigated numerically and experimentally. Numerical computations were performed using DLR, German Aerospace Center’s finite volume solver TAU, and experimental data were gathered by using particle image velocimetry carried out in a stereoscopic setup at the rotor test facility in Göttingen. Algorithms deriving the vortex position, swirl velocity, circulation, and core radius were implemented. The agreement is better the lower the wake age is, with numerical dissipation enlarging the blade-tip vortex in an artificial manner with increasing wake age. Nevertheless, the numerical simulations are able to predict swirl velocity and circulation well and help understanding the growth and development of the blade-tip vortices. A comparison with a nonrotating version of this blade showed that the circulation of the nonrotating blade was in the same order.",55,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034654,"The effect of variation in the Reynolds number is investigated in transonic computational fluid dynamics simulations around C141 airfoils. There is an interest in the effect of variation in pressure distribution on the airfoil due to changes in boundary-layer/wake development by the Reynolds number effect, which is often referred to as an indirect Reynolds number effect. Focus is placed on the physical mechanism of the indirect Reynolds number effect, so that airfoil shapes/flow conditions yielding noticeable indirect Reynolds number effect are explored in this research. A specific condition is found that gives a drastic change of aerodynamic coefficients with the increase in Reynolds number. This phenomenon occurs with the drastic change of the location of the shock wave, and then the structures of separation vortices are changed at the wake of the root of the shock wave. It is confirmed that a noticeable indirect Reynolds number effect occurs with large shock waves in a two-dimensional transonic flowfield.",55,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034739,"This paper introduces the comprehensive design of a thin piezoelectric-driven fin. Because of its hinge and flexible spar component having a low torsional stiffness with a thin composite actuator, the divergence speed is also predicted to be low, which is ascertained by a wind-tunnel test. As the divergence is related to the first pitch mode, the control input magnitude may be significantly reduced at the divergence speed. An improved design of the fin is also suggested to ensure its operability up to Mach 0.6. Its equivalent aeroelastic analysis is conducted by rational function approximation, and a linear quadratic regulator control law is designed using a steady-state Kalman filter with disturbance and an integral state for the tip deflection state augmentation. Both open- and closed-loop simulations are conducted while considering the input voltage saturation and other nonlinear losses in the actuator. In the relevant simulation, it is shown that a sufficient amount of pitch rotation can be achieved without any overshoots while consuming half of the zero-load voltage. Additionally, an external disturbance such as a gust can be sufficiently suppressed by increasing the closed-loop bandwidth.",55,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034646,"Experiments indicate that vortices trailing finite wings can be perturbed by periodic wing pitching, leading to rapid dissipation and bursting. To illustrate the perturbation mechanism, Betz vortex rollup relations are combined with the Theodorsen theory for unsteady lift response. A sinusoidal pitch motion on a rigid elliptic planform wing is computed in this study as one example. Pitching modifies the instantaneous lift due to the planform variations, via the reduced frequency, and the rollup relations are applied to low-frequency experimental conditions. The combined Betz–Theodorsen theory shows that relatively large spanwise perturbations of the vortex centers can be achieved and may accelerate the exponential growth associated with the Crow instability. In fact, 84.2% of the displacement of the unsteady trailing vortices due to unsteady pitching is oriented in the direction of the Crow instability. Furthermore, the axial velocity in the vortex center, calculated based on the Batchelor method, varies on the order of the flight speed. This forms two types of stagnation points produced by approaching and retreating axial core velocities; in the former case, conservation of mass leads to observations of “bursting.” This observation can be explained adequately on the basis of quasi-steady considerations.",55,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034709,"The interaction of trailing vortices with lifting surfaces is investigated using two levels of modeling fidelity. An overset mesh-based Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver is considered as the high-fidelity computational model. A lower-fidelity model is developed by combining a vortex panel method with a propeller aerodynamic model and slipstream theory. The high-fidelity model is first validated against available experimental data obtained from the interaction of a trailing vortex generated by an upstream wing with a downstream wing. The ability of both models to represent the development of the vortex wake and integrated loads is assessed for a number of parametric configurations, including a case in which the vortex core directly impinges on the wing surface. Following this, isolated propeller and wing-mounted propeller configurations are studied. In all of these cases, the high-fidelity model is effective in predicting the details of the flow and integrated airloads. The low-fidelity model, although less accurate, is shown to accurately predict interactional air loads and performance at orders of magnitude less cost than the high-fidelity model, justifying its role as a viable tool in design and trajectory-planning applications.",55,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034731,"This paper presents a concept of a multicopter that can be reconfigured between a quadcopter, hexacopter, octocopter, and decacopter. The controls for each of the configurations are identified, and for the configurations with control redundancy, the power optimal controls are presented. A dynamic simulation model is implemented and used to compare the various configurations. The maximum useful weights of the octocopter, hexacopter, and quadcopter were 76.5%, 53.1%, and 29.7% that of the decacopter, respectively. Over a range of useful weights, the decacopter required the least power when the useful weight was greater than around 23% of its maximum, due to lower induced and profile power requirements of the lighter-loaded, slower-spinning rotors. At lower useful weights, smaller configurations required less power due to their lower empty weight. Increasing the number of rotors increased the maximum hover endurance, cruise endurance, and maximum range. Maximum moments and accelerations produced by each aircraft are also explored, with the hexacopter being the most agile at low useful weight, and the decacopter most agile at high weight. Each configuration exhibits longitudinal and lateral phugoid modes. The larger configurations had higher surge/sway and less negative damping ratios.",55,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034631,"A new breakup criterion is proposed in this paper for droplets subject to the flowfield generated by an incoming airfoil (that is, the criterion should be applied only to this type of aerodynamics flow). This criterion is based on the study of the characteristic times involved in the problem. These are the characteristic external flowfield variation time and the characteristic droplet deformation time. The criterion takes the shape of an empirical correlation that relates the Weber number at the onset of the breakup to the external flowfield and droplet characteristics. Experimental data on the droplet deformation and breakup tests conducted in a rotating arm facility are used to generate the data used to develop the correlation. Droplets, with diameters in the range of 0.3–3.6 mm, are allowed to fall in the path of an incoming airfoil attached to the end of a rotating arm. Airfoil velocities vary between 50 and . The airfoil leading-edge radius varies from 0.030 to 0.103 m. Experiments are recorded with a high-speed camera using the shadowgraph illumination technique. The empirical breakup correlation applies to droplets that break in the bag and stamen mode. Some additional limited data on droplets that break in the bag and the shear mode are analyzed to see how they fit into the correlation.",55,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034716,"The paper presents an experimental study, conducted by the Israel Air Force, aimed at the assessment of several advanced flutter flight-test techniques that are designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of flutter tests. These include the autoregressive moving-average and operational modal analysis system identification methods, the use of various system stability parameters, and the use of atmospheric turbulence versus prescribed flaperon motion as the source of structural response excitation. The methods are evaluated based on data from a dedicated transonic flight test of the F-16 platform. All of the tested methods are able to accurately predict the instability onset. The operational modal analysis method has the advantage that it does not require a priori knowledge of the instability mechanism, whereas the autoregressive moving-average method is easier to implement and straightforward to use in real time. Excitation by atmospheric turbulence is found to be adequate in the current test case, in which the modes are lightly damped and highly suitable for system identification methods that rely on stochastic inputs. The use of autoregressive moving-average and operational modal analysis methods based on responses to atmospheric turbulence appears to offer an accurate and cost-effective flutter testing methodology.",55,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034659,"A high-fidelity prediction of near-field sonic-boom signature is performed. Three benchmark cases (including an axisymmetric body, a simple delta wing–body, and a complete low-boom supersonic transport configuration) and the Lockheed Martin 1021 (LM1021) case are simulated with a hybrid grid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver, HUNS3D, to predict near-field sonic-boom signature. Overall, the computational results agree well with the wind-tunnel experiment data. The influence of geometrical modification, grid size and distribution, spatial discretization schemes, and viscosity are studied and analyzed. The near-field signature of the LM1021 configuration propagating to the ground is analyzed by a linear wave approach.",55,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034651,"Leading edge contamination on aircraft wings can occur through the accumulation of insect residues, ice, or dirt or through existing surface defects. Such protuberances can increase skin friction drag by causing an earlier transition of the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent flow. To determine the likelihood of this effect, a simple and approximate model was developed for determining the critical height for boundary-layer transition on the airfoil leading edge. The model assumes an outer potential flow based on an effective leading edge radius coupled with an inner flow based on semi-empirical laminar boundary profiles. The effective leading edge radius was based on leading edge pressure distribution as related to flow over a cylinder and tends to the geometric leading edge radius for the limits of no camber and zero angle of attack. The model was compared with available experimental transition results, which showed that the predictions are reasonable but approximate. The potential susceptibility of various airfoils to transition was next considered using sample insect residues heights. The results indicate that laminar flow airfoils for large commercial aircraft would be significantly susceptible to transition due to insect contamination, whereas high-altitude low-speed UAVs would generally not have such susceptibility.",55,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034649,"A two-dimensional over–under turbine-based combined-cycle inlet system that exhibits the fluid–structure interaction phenomenon is investigated at both design and off-design states. The mesh-based parallel code coupling interface is used to perform a two-way loosely coupled data exchange across the fluid–structural interfaces. Results indicate that, although the performance variation is limited at a ramjet mode with , unexpected limit cycle oscillations appear accompanied by unsteady amplitudes. Moreover, a remarkable unstart delay along with the deceleration process of performance deterioration can be observed when the backpressure goes through a rapid increase, where the upward deformation of the splitter plate plays a significant role in resisting the downstream disturbance. In contrast, the fluid–structure interaction effect leads to an earlier occurrence of inlet unstart when the angle of attack varies periodically, and it induces limit cycle oscillations at a higher varying frequency. The study reveals the necessity of attaching more importance to the aeroelastic behavior of the splitter plate in the future research and operation of the over–under turbine-based combined-cycle inlet system.",55,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034617,This paper describes the effects of a composite coupled blade spar on the performance of a slowed-rotation-frequency helicopter rotor in high-speed edgewise flight. Antisymmetric composite coupling in the spar of a UH-60A-like rotor can provide a significant efficiency increase when rotation frequency is reduced. Comprehensive analysis was performed using a full three-dimensional finite element analysis-based aeroelastic computational structural dynamics solver with the inclusion of a free-wake aerodynamics model. This was validated using existing UH-60A test data for high advance ratios. The current study shows that a composite blade can achieve a maximum increase in the lift-to-drag ratio of 1.3 (20% improvement) at 85% of the nominal rotation frequency (NR) of . This efficiency gain is achieved through a combination of delayed stall drag along the retreating side of the rotor and reduced negative lift along the advancing side. A further reduction to 65NR showed a maximum efficiency improvement of 15% and was attributed only to the alleviation of negative lift. A hygrothermally stable layup was shown to perform as well as a nominal coupled layup at 85NR and marginally better at 65NR. Close study of the strains in the rotor showed that these rotors would be within the realm of practical manufacturability as axial strains fell within IM7/8552’s allowable tensile strain of 6000 microstrain.,55,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034661,"The aerospace industry’s current trend towards novel or More Electric architectures results in some unique challenges for designers due to both the scarcity or absence of historical data and a potentially large combinatorial space of possible architectures. These add to the already existing challenges of attempting to optimize an aircraft design in the presence of multiple possible objective functions while avoiding an overly compartmentalized approach. This paper uses the Integrated Subsystem Sizing and Architecture Assessment Capability to pursue a multi-objective optimization for a large twin-aisle aircraft and a small single-aisle aircraft using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm with parallel function evaluations. One novelty of the optimization setup is that it explicitly considers the impacts of subsystem architectures in addition to those of traditional aircraft-level design variables. The optimization yields generations of nondominated designs in which substantially electrified subsystem architectures are found to predominate. As a first assessment of the impact of epistemic uncertainty on the results obtained, the optimization is rerun with altered sensitivities for the thrust-specific fuel consumption penalties due to shaft-power and bleed air extraction. This analysis demonstrated that the composition of architectures on the Pareto frontier is sensitive to the secondary power extraction penalties, but more so for the small single-aisle aircraft than the large twin-aisle aircraft.",55,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034827,"Payload transportation via connected modular unmanned aerial vehicles is an emerging new area that offers unique advantages over other forms of aerial logistics. When considering rigidly attached, modular, vertical lift, unmanned aerial vehicles, differing payloads and vehicle attachment geometries have a significant effect on the composite aircraft’s dynamic response during takeoff and stabilization. With no prior knowledge of payload parameters or vehicle attachment geometry, there is no inherent flightworthiness guarantee for a specific connected configuration. Onground flightworthiness determination can be used to ensure acceptable performance during vehicle takeoff or to prescribe changes to the vehicle attachment geometry if necessary. This paper introduces an algorithm to determine flightworthiness while in partial ground contact by estimating the vehicle attachment positions and payload weight. The algorithm uses a probabilistic estimate of vehicle placement about the payload derived through a Bayesian learning technique to generate the necessary data to deterministically estimate the attached vehicles’ positions. Following a description of the algorithm, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm for a variety of modular aircraft configurations.",55,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034714,"This paper presents the results of an experimental study on supercooled droplet deformation and breakup near the leading edge of an airfoil. The results are compared to prior room-temperature droplet deformation results to explore the effects of droplet supercooling. The experiments were conducted in the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand at The Pennsylvania State University. An airfoil model placed at the end of the rotor blades mounted onto the hub in the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand chamber was moved at speeds ranging between 50 and . The temperature of the chamber was . A monotonic droplet generator was used to produce droplets that fell perpendicular to the airfoil path. High-speed imaging was employed to observe the interaction between the droplets and the airfoil. Cases with equal slip and initial velocity were selected for the two environmental conditions. The airfoil velocity was , and the slip velocity for both sets of data was . The deformation of the weakly supercooled and warm droplets did not present different trends. The similar behavior for both conditions indicates that water supercooling has no effect on particle deformation for the range of supercooling of the droplets tested and the selected impact velocity.",55,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034711,"Presented in this paper are a sliding morphing skin and its design methodology. Instead of deforming a skin to morph with the underlying structure, a sliding skin is designed to morph using the relative sliding motion among the segmented panels. To realize this design, a design methodology is developed. It starts with discretizing the original wing skin along the airfoil to determine the number of segmented panels. Then, each segmented panel is designed as a telescopic sliding panel longitudinally, while interlayered laterally with the adjacent panels. To allow for the intended morphing motions, each panel pair is designed to connect to the inboard and outboard ribs via two separate passive linkages. To investigate the feasibility of a sliding skin, a kinematic model is provided to facilitate the establishment of the constraint equations (i.e., the conditions that these panels should meet during morphing). A search method is developed to solve the underlying problem. The proposed method is applied to simulate morphing motions, including dihedral, sweep, twist, and span. The results show that a sliding skin is kinematically feasible for these applications through a proper design. A preliminary aerodynamic analysis is presented to outline the possible flow characteristics observed on the sliding skin. At the end, this method is applied to design the morphing skin for the wing–winglet junction.",55,5
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034647,"A series of comprehensive flight tests investigated the flight dynamics and explored the flight envelope of a newly developed ultralight, coaxial, counter-rotating helicopter from the company edm aerotec. The present paper focuses on optical measurement techniques that were applied to study the minimum blade tip clearance and convection of blade tip vortices around the dual-rotor system. A calibrated single-camera system was used to quantify the movement and distances of the blade tips at a critical rotor azimuth for multiple steady and unsteady flight maneuvers. The measurements allowed critical flight conditions to be identified and provided flight data for the validation of comprehensive rotor codes. In an additional flight test, an airborne background-oriented schlieren system was operated aboard a second helicopter to visualize the blade tip vortices of the ultralight helicopter in forward flight. The background-oriented schlieren measurements resulted in the first visualization of blade–vortex and vortex–structure interaction effects on a full-scale coaxial helicopter. The application of optical measurement systems in the present flight tests gives valuable insight into the aerodynamics and blade dynamics of a free-flying counter-rotating helicopter and demonstrates how these methods can effectively support the development process of new rotorcraft.",55,5
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034782,"A computational study on the wake characteristics of span-optimized wings is discussed, where the effect of the wing spanload on the resulting wake rollup characteristics and structure is emphasized. Two wing configurations, each optimized for minimum induced drag at a fixed and fixed bending-moment constraint, are studied; and their wake characteristics are compared against an elliptically loaded wing. Results from Navier–Stokes simulations across the near-field wake demonstrate a symmetric large-scale rotation of the entire wake structure, centered roughly at the quarter-span location, for the bending-optimized wings. This wake structure is contrasted with the classical tip vortex formation associated with the elliptic spanload, which occurs immediately in the wing near-field wake. The far-wake structure was also studied using a free-wake simulation approach. The results from this analysis indicate a gradual rollup of the entire wake far downstream for the bending-optimized wings. This absence of wake rollup in the near field is envisaged as a potential means to reduce vortex interactions with downstream surfaces of aircraft and prevent other adverse operational challenges associated with wingtip vortices.",55,5
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C032099,"A new proposal for formulating reliability-based design optimization problems, named the multistage reliability-based design optimization approach, is presented. The classical reliability-based design optimization formulation determines all decision variables here and now in the presence of uncertainty. Nevertheless, in many complex systems design applications, the product development process gradually evolves through time, and decisions at the ensuing milestones are made on the basis of increased knowledge on previously uncertain factors. If the delay leading to such informed resolutions is deemed acceptable to the decision maker, then it would be advantageous to wait and see how the less-urgent design issues run their courses until more concrete insights on the relevant uncertain parameters are obtained. The multistage reliability-based design optimization approach accounts for such follow-on corrective decisions based on the partial realizations of random parameters at selected stages along the engineering design process, thereby further enhancing the practicality of reliability-based design optimization. This paper presents a mathematical formulation of multistage reliability-based design optimization and its application to a conceptual design of a regenerative solar powered high-altitude aircraft, which indicate that the multistage reliability-based design optimization method, reflecting real-world engineering practices, produces more favorable solutions than the classical reliability-based design optimization approach.",55,5

The Quad-M basics of system identification requirements are carefully investigated for time-invariant and time-varying COG estimation during airdrop maneuver as a case study that contains both conditions. Modeling and simulation of airdrop maneuver are employed to prepare the required maneuver and measurement data for this investigation. The relative-acceleration equation, as a model structure, and parameter modeling of time-varying COG location and acceleration are introduced into the system identification and parameter estimation framework. The Kalman filter method is applied to investigate the estimation of aircraft COG location. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to assess the performance of the algorithm in the presence of measurement errors and model uncertainties. As a conclusion, the aircraft COG position based on the kinematics approach, and independent of kinetics, is conditionally identifiable that could be an applicable technology for the use in adaptive flight control as well as Health and Usage Monitoring Systems.",55,5
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034811,"Recent aircraft designs have considered higher-aspect-ratio wings to reduce induced drag for improved fuel efficiency; however, to remain compliant with airport gate requirements, folding wingtips have been introduced as a solution to the increased wingspan. Recent numerical studies suggest that a folding wingtip solution may be incorporated with spring devices to provide an additional gust loads alleviation ability in flight as well. In this work, a series of low-speed steady and dynamic wind tunnel tests was conducted using a prototype of such a concept. It was found that a folding wingtip with a nonzero relative angle of the folding hinge axis to the streamwise direction could provide gust loads alleviation. The level of load alleviation varied with hinge spring stiffness and lifting condition, with the best performance achieving a 56% reduction in peak loading.",55,5

Minitabs, which are small spanwise strips that protrude normal to the airfoil’s upper surface, have been studied to alleviate this requirement. To investigate the minitab’s steady-state effects, force and particle image velocimetry measurements were conducted at on a NACA0012 airfoil. Minitabs with heights of and 0.04 were placed at a wide range of chordwise locations. In general, the optimum location for peak lift reduction moved toward the leading edge as the angle of attack increased, with significant effect on the lift curve gradient. Trailing-edge placement was effective at small angles. Placement close to the midchord provided a constant effect across the range of . For both locations, the baseline flow separation progressed ahead of the minitab with increasing , which reduced effectiveness at stall. In comparison, placement close to the leading edge was ineffective for small . At high , a large flow separation reduced lift by up to but increased the unsteady forces.",55,5

In KLE, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the autocovariance are obtained by using orthogonal basis functions, and the KLE for correlated random excitations relies on expansions in terms of correlated sets of random variables. The autocovariance functions of excitation are discretized into a series of correlated excitations, and then the structural response is carried out by using NFEM and sampling techniques. The proposed algorithm is applied to both rigid and flexible aircraft wings. Two different types of the boundary condition are studied for the flexible wing: fixed and large mass method (LMM). Results show that the geometric nonlinearity has a stiffening effect on the behavior of the aircraft wing, resulting in an oscillatory response with a lower amplitude, and changes the distribution of the random responses. The response due to LMM boundary condition that is closer to the actual conditions is smaller than the response obtained using fixed boundary condition.",55,5

The hardware used for air-to-air refueling needs to be tailored to the specific aircraft and airspeeds involved, performing markedly different for permutations of tanker and receiver craft. Extensive flight testing is costly and risky to equipment and personnel, but laboratory testing is marred by unrepresentative test conditions. This Paper presents the first full-scale hybrid test of an air-to-air refueling probe and drogue contact, where physical refueling hardware in the laboratory is coupled to a numerical simulation of the remainder of the system using sensors and actuators. It is found that the forces and motion trajectories faithfully capture the characteristic drogue response dynamics in full refueling scenarios. Rigorous validation shows that the method can emulate the dominant contact–impact phenomena observed in air-to-air refueling scenarios with high repeatability, including problematic design-critical responses such as drogue tipping and hose whip. With the costs of equipping a tanker fleet standing around 500 million, the technique offers an important means of laboratory testing to inform design iterations, reducing development timescales and costs, as well as improving safety and reliability before flight testing.",55,5
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034690,"The performance and effectiveness of serpentine dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators as hingeless high-lift devices on a three-dimensional airplane model were investigated. Attempts were made to design the actuators in the most optimized way, based on the reported results of the latest dielectric barrier discharge optimization efforts. Four actuators were mounted onto four different locations of the wings as the leading-edge slat, spoiler, flap, and leading-edge aileron. Operation of the actuators on one wing increased and/or decreased the lift/drag and generated a gradual rolling moment. The experiments were performed separately for each actuator at three different Reynolds numbers, seven angles of attack, three peak-to-peak voltages, and three wave frequencies. The Reynolds numbers were approximately , , and . The evaluation based on actuators effects on rolling moment generation was performed, and the results indicate that employing the serpentine dielectric barrier discharge actuators as high-lift devices for low Reynolds number applications is possible, especially as DBD slat and DBD spoiler, and they can have the same effect of a conventional aileron only for normal flight maneuvering, with low power consumption.",55,5

Predicting the convection of the coherent vortical flow structures generated by the fuselage as well as the rotor head is a difficult goal by the application of numerical methods. Furthermore, the accurate determination of the wake flowfield requires the detailed knowledge of the origin of the associated coherent structures. Therefore, numerical and experimental investigations have been conducted on a twin-engine light utility helicopter. The wind-tunnel model includes a fuselage and a rotating five-bladed rotor head. To obtain the wake flowfield, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry is applied. The numerical investigations are performed with a commercial flow solver. The flow solver is based on the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Turbulence modeling is performed with the scale-adaptive simulation model. The motion of the rotor head is covered by the moving and deforming mesh methods. The wake-flow velocity distribution obtained by the experimental data and the numerical results shows a good agreement and allows a detailed analysis of the dominant vortical flow structures propagating downstream.",55,5
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034832,"A logistics issue for guided air-drop systems is maintaining batteries inside the airborne guidance unit so that when the system is deployed the batteries are adequately charged to power onboard electronics and actuators. It is typical for a guided air-drop system to be packed and readied for use well before deployment, leading to nonnegligible battery self-discharge. This necessitates a process to both monitor battery life and recharge the systems after a certain time interval. This paper explores, using a small-scale wind turbine system, providing the requisite power for onboard electronics and actuation for a guided air-drop system. Sizing studies are reported to estimate the necessary size of the rotor and generator. Using this information, a full-scale airborne guidance unit was designed, fabricated, and tested in a wind tunnel. Results indicate that a 0.33 m diam turbine system can generate over 3.7 W of continuous power, which is sufficient to provide power to low-power consumption guided air-drop systems, such as a bleed-air actuated system.",55,5
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034634,"To develop recommendations for procedures for helicopter source noise characterization, the effects of crosswinds on main rotor harmonic noise radiation are assessed using a semi-empirical model of the Bell 430 helicopter. Crosswinds are found to have a significant effect on blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise radiation when the helicopter is trimmed with the fuselage oriented along the inertial flight path, resulting in a “slipped” flight condition. However, the magnitude of BVI noise remains unchanged when the pilot orients the fuselage along the aerodynamic velocity vector, “crabbing” for zero aerodynamic sideslip angle. The effects of wind gradients on BVI noise are also investigated and found to be smaller in the crosswind direction than in the headwind direction. The effects of crosswinds on lower harmonic noise sources at higher flight speeds are also assessed. In all cases, the directivity of radiated noise is somewhat changed by the crosswind. The model predictions agree well with a limited set of flight test data for the Bell 430 helicopter for cruise and approach flight conditions, both measured with and without crosswinds present. The results of this investigation would suggest that flight paths for future acoustic flight testing are best aligned across the prevailing wind direction to minimize the effects of winds on noise measurements when wind cannot otherwise be avoided.",55,5
