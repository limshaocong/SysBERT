1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033433,"A coordinated project has been underway to improve computational fluid dynamics predictions of slender airframe aerodynamics. The work is focused on two flow conditions and leverages a unique flight data set obtained with an F-16XL aircraft. These conditions, a low-speed high angle-of-attack case and a transonic low angle-of-attack case, were selected from a prior prediction campaign wherein the computational fluid dynamics failed to provide acceptable results. In this paper, the background, objectives, and approach to the current project are presented. The work embodies predictions from multiple numerical formulations that are contributed from multiple organizations, and the context of this campaign to other multicode, multi-organizational efforts is included. The relevance of this body of work toward future supersonic commercial transport concepts is also briefly addressed.",54,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033211,"In the framework of the Cranked-Arrow Wing Aerodynamics Project International 2, Netherlands National Aerospace Laboratory performed an analysis of a set of transonic flight conditions available in the Cranked-Arrow Project database. Flight condition FC70 was used previously during the Cranked-Arrow Wing Aerodynamics Project International to investigate transonic flow on the F-16XL aircraft. During this project, it was discovered that flight condition FC70 was flown with a deflected leading-edge flap. To facilitate computational fluid analysis, a transonic flight condition without deflected control surfaces was judged desirable by the Cranked-Arrow Project members. Therefore, it was decided to search the Cranked-Arrow Project database for a transonic flight condition without any control surface deflections. Because no information on the control surface deflections of the other transonic flight conditions was available to the Cranked-Arrow Project partners, an alternative approach to scrutinize the available flight-test sectional surface pressure measurements for indications of control surface deflections was adopted. This analysis revealed that flight condition FC79 was the most likely transonic flight condition to be flown without any control surface deflections. Flight conditions FC70 and FC79 were analyzed using National Aerospace Laboratory’s in-house-developed flow simulation system ENFLOW. Comparison of the measured and simulated surface pressure coefficients confirmed that flight condition FC79 was flown without any control surface deflections, and that this flight condition is thus much better suited for further comparisons between flight-test data and computational fluid dynamics simulations.",54,2

Some examples are conditions that cannot be tested before a flight test. To rely on these methods, it is essential that they are assessed and evaluated with a state-of-the-art wind tunnel test and/or in-flight data. In a previous project, Cranked-Arrow Wing Aerodynamics Project International, it was reported that all computational fluid dynamics methods failed to some degree in the transonic regime where shock–vortex interaction phenomena were present. Detailed analysis of surface pressure distribution showed that computational fluid dynamics was not able replicate the correct flowfield and produce acceptable results. This paper aims to restudy those transonic flight conditions for which computational fluid dynamics underperforms and to try to determine or shed light on the extent to which surface effects contribute to the computational fluid dynamics predictions.",54,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033227,This article presents an aeroelastic study of CAWAPI F-16XL aircraft. The structural model of this aircraft is not publicly available and is therefore replaced by a structural model estimate that is constructed based on data available in public literature. The aeroelastic solution is done using solution for two flight conditions—FC70 and FC25. The primary task is to assess the importance of the aeroelastic effects on the FC70 solution and to assess whether large discrepancies are observed at flight condition FC70 between the computational and experimental data.,54,2

The NASA Tetrahedral Unstructured Software System with its USM3D solver is used to perform numerical simulations. This computational fluid dynamics suite is developed and maintained by the NASA Langley Research Center. The CRISP CFD package is used to provide error estimates and grid adaptation for validation of USM3D results. A subsonic high-angle-of-attack case flight condition 25 is computed and analyzed. Three turbulence models are used in the calculations: the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras, the two-equation shear-stress transport, and the turbulence models. Computational results and surface-static-pressure profiles are presented and compared with flight data. Solution validation is performed using formal grid-refinement studies, the solution of error-transport equations, and adaptive mesh refinement. The current study shows that the USM3D solver coupled with CRISP CFD can be used to provide valuable data in predicting vortex-flow physics on a complex configuration.",54,2

The scope of the paper probes for the quality and quantity of high-resolution numerical simulations possible with the current computer capacity at free-flight Reynolds numbers. It provides an insight into the effect of turbulence modeling of these complicated flows; the free-flight measured pressure distributions are compared with solutions achieved with the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model, the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model with rotation correct, the model, and the turbulence model with scale-adaptive simulation.

The work is focused on two flow conditions and leverages a unique flight data set obtained with the F-16XL aircraft for comparison and validation. These conditions, a low-speed high-angle-of-attack case and a transonic low-angle-of-attack case, were selected from a prior prediction campaign wherein the computational fluid dynamics failed to provide acceptable results. In revisiting these two cases, approaches for improved results include better, denser grids using more grid adaptation to local flow features as well as unsteady higher-fidelity physical modeling like hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation methods. The work embodies predictions from multiple numerical formulations that are contributed from multiple organizations where some authors investigate other possible factors that could explain the discrepancies in agreement (e.g., effects due to deflected control surfaces during the flight tests as well as static aeroelastic deflection of the outer wing). This paper presents the synthesis of all the results and findings and draws some conclusions that lead to an improved understanding of the underlying flow physics, finally making the connections between the physics and aircraft features.",54,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033500,"As the aircraft control surface deflection system formed by the hydraulic booster is complex, the faults of the system are difficult to be detected. It is necessary to study the control system stability and analyze the reliability in order to provide a theoretical basis for improving the reliability and security of the system. By building the booster model while considering the structural elasticity, the gap of the support structure, and the oil leakage coefficient, the effects of parametric variations for the booster model are studied based on the system stability condition. On this basis, the failure mode effect analysis and fault tree analysis are conducted to obtain the main failures and the weaknesses of the system.

9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033767,"This paper presents the design, a numerical aeroservoelastic investigation, and an experimental proof of concept of an autonomous flap system. Autonomous flaps are load-alleviation devices, intended for installation in the trailing edge of aerodynamic lifting surfaces (for example, wings or wind turbine blades) as plug-and-play units. An autonomous flap system, which is integrated into a free-floating flap actuated by a trailing-edge tab, consists of actuators, sensors, and a controller. Such a system is self-sufficient because it generates sufficient energy by harvesting the energy of mechanical vibrations. The energy-harvesting process is particularly efficient when the wing-flap system starts to flutter, which is then transformed into limit-cycle oscillations using the control system or structural delimiters. It has been shown experimentally and numerically that the autonomous flap system, when mounted in an aeroelastic apparatus, flutters at low wind speeds. During a wind-tunnel experiment, this flutter motion is converted into stable high-amplitude limit-cycle oscillations by limiting the amplitude of the flap deflections, whereas low-amplitude limit cycles could be reached by control activity. The autonomous flap system, when in controlled limit-cycle oscillation, has a positive energy balance. Sufficient energy could thus be generated to power sensors and actuators such that the flap system can be indeed used as an autonomous device.",54,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033869,"This paper discusses the application of a particle swarm optimization technique to a rotor dynamics analysis to perform multivariable optimization for minimizing power output for a variable-speed variable-geometry rotor system. A UH-60A Black Hawk helicopter rotor operating at a weight coefficient of is taken as the baseline configuration to study the impact of power reduction through speed and geometry optimization. With the objective of keeping the computational cost low, a rotor dynamics model with the assumption of rigid blades having only flap degree of freedom is developed and coupled to a nonlinear aerodynamic model that has airfoil lookup tables, attached unsteady aerodynamic model and Drees inflow model. The rotor dynamics model is then validated using the flight-test data available in literature. The main rotor power is taken as the fitness function for the particle swarm optimization, and single-variable and multivariable optimizations are carried out to systematically establish the relative significance of various optimization parameters for power minimization. Blade parameters such as radius, chord, trailing-edge plate extension, rotor speed, and blade twist are optimized. For the forward-flight conditions analyzed, the multivariable optimization using all parameters results in a significantly higher power reduction (5.4 to 12.2% more) than that attainable through the optimization by single variables. The rotor speed, radius, and chord (in that order) are the most significant contributors to total power reduction in the multivariable optimization, followed by twist and trailing-edge plate extension.",54,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033828,"Ice accumulation on aircraft wings can cause a loss in lift and increased drag. The present research investigates the effect of using a superhydrophobic coating, applied on an aluminum small-scale two-dimensional NACA 0012 airfoil, on ice accretion. The coating used is a commercial product that provides a contact angle of 160 deg, whereas the contact angle hysteresis is 6 deg. Experiments are conducted in a small-scale closed-loop icing wind tunnel at flow velocities ranging from 10 to , air temperatures from 0 to , a liquid water content between 1.0 and , and a mean volume diameter from 25 to . The experiments show that, compared to the aluminum airfoil, the superhydrophobic airfoil counteracts the formation of ice at air temperatures as low as . The results indicate a 50% power reduction to keep the superhydrophobic airfoil ice free in the simulated icing conditions and a time reduction of 75% to deice the airfoil when compared to the aluminum airfoil. It is deduced that no ice accretes on the airfoil when only its direct droplet impact area is covered with the superhydrophobic coating in anti-icing mode.",54,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033830,"To accurately predict the ice shape on the fuselage under rotor-wake effects, discrete modeling of individual tip vortices is essential to determine the local aerodynamic interactions between the vortex and the fuselage. To this end, the actuator surface model is developed and applied to the present study. Then, water-droplet-trajectory prediction, thermal analysis, and ice growth module are seamlessly integrated. This study aims to perform detailed analysis of the rotor downwash effects on ice that accretes on a helicopter fuselage and to determine the variation with respect to the forward flight speed. As a result of comprehensive numerical computations, the following conclusions are reached. First, the rotor inflow transforms the droplet trajectories, the location of ice accretion and the amount of ice are changed. Actually, 16.5% less ice is accumulated on the overall fuselage in the rotor–fuselage interaction case compared to the isolated fuselage case. Second, a clear-cut distinction of the icing locations on the fuselage is observed with various advance ratios. In hovering conditions, massive ice is accumulated on the tail-boom and fuselage nose region, where the tip vortices collide with fuselage. Due to the large collision area with high speed of droplets, 15.2 and 9.1% more ice is accumulated in hovering case than that of forward flight case with the advance ratio 0.075 and 0.15, respectively. However, as the forward speed grows from 0.15 to 0.2, the total mass of ice exponentially increases. In case of the advance ratio 0.2, 36% more ice is accumulated than that of the hovering case.",54,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033909,"A morphing droop-nose wing tip with span of 1.3 m and target 2 deg droop was designed, manufactured, and tested as part of the European project Novel Air Vehicle Configurations: From Fluttering Wings to Morphing Flight. The morphing droop-nose device featured a fiberglass composite skin with optimized three-dimensional thickness distribution, which was supported by topology-optimized superelastic nickel titanium and aluminum internal compliant mechanisms. The tests included ground and low-speed wind-tunnel tests with the aim of assessing the structural performance and the design chain through measurements of shape, strains, surface pressures, and total forces/moments on the model. Comparisons with the experimental results were used for validation of the computational models and optimization tools. The morphing device was able to change shape while resisting the external loads, and it was identified that the distribution of strain and shape accuracy may be improved through the use of a concurrent as opposed to sequential design chain and other developments to the optimization tools. The use of a superelastic material facilitated the high-strain displacement, exceeding 2% strain in the design case and measured up to 4.54%, making it highly suitable for compliant mechanism applications. This paper explains the insights made from the experimental tests and recommendations for the future design of morphing structures.",54,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033847,"The paper deals with the assessment of the reliability of simplified rotorcraft models in the evaluation of maneuvering potential using inverse simulation. Inverse solutions obtained for the same maneuver from models of different complexity and fidelity are compared with the objective of identifying the most appropriate model for a consistent evaluation of vehicle handling qualities at the minimum computational cost. A total of nine rotor blade models, three main rotor inflow models, and two fuselage aerodynamic databases are combined for deriving 10 different helicopter simulation models analyzed in five maneuvers. Inverse solutions are obtained by means of an integration method for hurdle-hop, slalom, and lateral repositioning maneuvers. Once the maneuvers are solved for the baseline rotorcraft model, the uncertainty associated with the command law identified by means of simpler models is determined. The quantitative evaluation of model reliability from a set of simulation tests is further analyzed on a pop-up-pop-down maneuver and a 180 deg fast turn for validating the approach. The results show that uncertainty intervals are correctly identified, although with some degree of conservativeness when less demanding maneuvers are dealt with.",54,2

The two approaches are based on the nonlinear finite element method and on multibody dynamics, and they employ aerodynamic formulations based on the doublet lattice method and strip theory, respectively. Static aeroelastic results in terms of wing integrated loads at various trim conditions for a very flexible aircraft test case are presented and compared to the linear ones. Significant differences are found between linear and nonlinear approaches, and attention is drawn to the importance of the follower force effects of the aerodynamics and of considering large displacements and rotations, which are identified as the main sources of the discrepancies, for the static flight loads computation and subsequent structural sizing of the wing.",54,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033859,"The design of composite structures based on fiber angle optimization rapidly becomes intractable as the number of design variables increases. Lamination parameters can be used as intermediate design variables to overcome this issue. An extra step is then required to convert optimal designs expressed in lamination parameters into feasible blended stacking sequences. However, disparities between the lamination parameter and stacking sequence designs performance are generally observed due to discrepancies between both design spaces. In this paper, the lamination parameter blending constraints recently proposed by the authors are applied to the aeroelastic design of the common research wing model to diminish these discrepancies and achieve more realistic lamination parameter designs. A comparison between the optimized designs achieved with and without the proposed blending constraints is carried out to evaluate this approach. Results demonstrate that the application of blending constraints greatly increases the matching quality between lamination parameter and stacking sequence designs, consequently facilitating the retrieval of equivalent blended stacking sequences.",54,2

The research is based on numerical simulations using the computational fluid dynamics method DLR TAU. The target configurations are swept wings of constant aspect ratio, variable leading-edge contours, and leading-edge sweep angles. The work deals with the onset of the vortical flow at the leading edge for constant and variable leading-edge nose radii, the influence of the angle of attack, the leading-edge sweep, and the onflow Mach number. Furthermore, the aerodynamic behavior is analyzed and assessed, as well as the specific flow physics in the vicinity of the vortical flow separation at round leading edges. The objective of the present work is to provide a contribution for the design and assessment of the physical characteristics of swept wing configurations. Furthermore, sensitivities will be given for the design process. In addition, the current investigation provides a deeper understanding of the separation onset process and the flow physics of swept wing configurations with round leading edges.",54,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033892,"The interaction between an existing stationary crossflow instability and a two-dimensional step excrescence placed into a swept boundary layer on a lifting surface has been investigated computationally. Backward-facing steps were found to not amplify the stationary modes. The existence of an additional local traveling instability was found in the recirculation region following the step. Further time-resolved calculations were recommended to confirm this mode as the cause of breakdown. Forward-facing steps were found to affect the transition location only once a critical step height was exceeded. This height was associated with sudden amplification of stationary crossflow modes and transition moving forward to the step. A physics-based correlation based on linear stability theory and associated with the height of the core of the stationary crossflow vortex was proposed for that critical height, which agreed well with results for the geometry and Reynolds numbers tested experimentally. Critical forward-facing step heights were in the majority of cases higher than those associated with backward-facing steps for the same conditions. Moreover, the physics associated with two-dimensional excrescences in swept-wing flow was fundamentally different from that associated with other types of roughness, as well as all roughnesses in two-dimensional flowfields. Upon further validation, the proposed correlation for forward-facing steps would provide a reasonable manufacturing criteria available to airframe designers that would prove less restrictive and more accurate than existing empirical criteria.",54,2

This study builds on previous work investigating the effect of exploiting the folding wingtips in flight as a device to reduce dynamic gust loads, but now with the introduction of a passive nonlinear negative stiffness hinge spring. A single-degree-of-freedom model and a representative civil jet aircraft aeroelastic model are used to investigate the dynamic gust responses for different hinge device designs.

The Design, Simulation and Flight Reynolds Number Testing for Advanced High-Lift Solution project, funded by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme, aimed at improving the aerodynamics of high-lift systems by developing, in a coordinated approach, both efficient numerical design strategies and measurement techniques for cryogenic conditions. Within the Design, Simulation and Flight Reynolds Number Testing for Advanced High-Lift Solution project, different partners used several numerical automatic optimization strategies for high-lift system design purposes. A realistic multi-objective and multipoint optimization problem was defined and solved by adopting different flow model dimensionality, meshing techniques, geometry parameterization, and optimization strategies. Special attention was devoted to perform a fair comparison of the results, and useful information was obtained about trends, pros, and cons of the approaches used. The outcome of these activities is that an efficient design process can be set up through decoupling of the original multi-objective problem into several, sequential suboptimization processes. Nevertheless, several decoupling possibilities exist, and the most efficient one can be identified only on the bases of preanalysis or preknowledge of the specific problem. Second, the exercise carried out demonstrated the maturity and feasibility of a full three-dimensional automatic high-lift design.",54,2
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033881,"Extensions to conventional aircraft aerodynamic models are required to adequately predict responses when nonlinear unsteady flight regimes are encountered, especially at high incidence angles and under maneuvering conditions. For a number of reasons, such as loss of control, both military and civilian aircraft may extend beyond normal and benign aerodynamic flight conditions. In addition, military applications may require controlled flight beyond the normal envelope, and civilian flight may require adequate recovery or prevention methods from these adverse conditions. These requirements have led to the development of more general aerodynamic modeling methods and provided the impetus for researchers to improve analytical and experimental techniques and the degree of collaboration between them. In addition to more general mathematical model structures, dynamic test methods have been designed to provide sufficient information to allow model identification. This paper summarizes research to develop a modeling methodology appropriate for modeling aircraft aerodynamics that include nonlinear unsteady behaviors using either experimental or computational test methods. This work was done at NASA Langley Research Center, primarily under the NASA Aviation Safety Program, to address aircraft loss of control, prevention, and recovery aerodynamics.",54,2

The inerter is a one-port mechanical device with the property that the applied force is proportional to the relative acceleration between its terminals. A linear model of a Fokker 100 aircraft main landing gear equipped with a shimmy-suppression device is presented. Time-domain optimizations of the shimmy-suppression device are carried out using cost functions of the maximum amplitude and the settling time of torsional-yaw motion.

Hence, development of efficient methodologies to determine the presence, location, and severity of damage in critical structural components is important in developing efficient structural health management systems. To avoid loss of control due to off-nominal conditions during a flight, load levels must be controlled such that it is safe to continue the flight without failure. Hence, a capability is needed for accurate real-time predictions of residual strength in aircraft structures with complex damage configurations. Elastic-plastic fracture-mechanics-based failure assessment diagrams combined with crack-tip opening displacement assist in determining whether the structure is safe under current operational loading conditions. A range of materials and thicknesses used in the aerospace industry are used to validate the crack-tip opening displacement-based failure assessment diagram procedure.",54,2

This innovative configuration is called pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure, a stitched carbon–epoxy material system that offers the opportunity for designing stiffer, lower weight, and more cost-efficient aircraft by eliminating fasteners and incorporating damage-tolerance concepts. Aside from superior structural performance and low-cost manufacturing methods, this configuration must also demonstrate advanced aeroelastic behavior to be fully implemented in commercial aircraft. A preliminary wing study of a general aviation aircraft that embodies pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure technology is presented in this paper, which will be compared with the structural, dynamic, and aeroelastic behavior of the original metallic wing model. The study showed that the presence of pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure panels leads to decreased deformations in static and aeroelastic analyses, higher natural frequencies and flutter speeds, and improved crashworthiness.

It is anticipated that a flight controller based on real-time distributed flow information feedback is more capable of rapidly responding to sudden airflow changes and may exhibit greater stability robustness properties than purely inertial feedback-based flight control laws. However, considering the uncertainty of state-of-the-art microflow sensor technologies, there is an urgent need for model calibration if flow information is to be used to calculate aerodynamic moments and/or forces for controlling aircraft motion. In this paper, a constrained least-squares estimator is developed to calculate the bias of distributed flow information to calibrate an aerodynamic moment model. Simulation and wind-tunnel experiment results demonstrate a significant improvement on the accuracy of the aerodynamic moment calculation after calibration.",54,2

27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034119,"Crack propagation tests were conducted to clarify the effect of stress ratio on crack growth rate in friction-stir-welded 2024-T3 aluminum alloy. The effect of the distance between the weld line center and the center of the specimen was also evaluated. The result indicates that the peak of the acceleration is not at the area of maximum tensile residual stress. The modified stress ratio that considers the residual stress identifies that the location of the peak modified stress ratio corresponds to that of the peak maximum acceleration. The relationship between stress ratio and crack growth acceleration in friction-stir-welded panels is also evaluated by an analysis using the stress intensity factor range with and without residual stress and the crack growth rate for the master curve obtained by the base material with a different stress range. The maximum acceleration decreases with the increase of the distance between the weld line center and the center of the specimen and with the increase of the stress ratio. Experimental and analytical results showed similar characteristics, although analytical results showed a larger acceleration ratio. Fracture surface observation implies that the small grain size in the stir zone would have prevented the formation of striations in the area.",54,2

The elevator, aileron, and rudder multistep excitations that maximize the D-optimality criterion were found by a genetic algorithm. Like for any dynamic system, this input-design process would require determining optimal time-dependent functions resulting in infinite-dimensional optimization. To limit the search-space dimensions, the switching points of the inputs were selected on the basis of the discrete wavelet transform. In the investigation, the design was compared with the maneuvers that used harmonically related multisines and typical multistep inputs (3-2-1-1 on elevator, 1-2-1 on aileron, rudder doublet) for simultaneous flight-control deflections. The case of typical excitations applied one at a time was examined as well. Through simulations, it was found that the maneuvers with simultaneous flight-control deflections that were based on the D-optimality criterion or harmonically related multisine signals are better in terms of accuracy, aircraft response, and resulting force than the designs based on the typical excitations.",54,2
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033750,"Wind-tunnel testing of ice accretion over aircraft wings is simulated numerically to investigate the effects of tunnel blockage and of the wall–wing interference at the wall–model juncture. The open-source OpenFOAM software is used to compute the flowfield and the trajectories of water droplets. The PoliMIce ice-prediction software is applied to solve the multiphase flow around the body surface and to compute the thickness of the iced layer. Blockage effects are investigated for diverse operating conditions. Similar to dry testing, wind-tunnel blockage is found to produce a variation of the apparent angle of attack of the airfoil with respect to the freestream. However, different from dry testing, the blockage correction is found to be a function of time, due to the continuous modification of the airfoil shape in time resulting from ice accretion. The wall–wing interference results in the occurrence of a shadow region where water droplets do not impinge. In the rime-ice regime, the shadow region is therefore free of ice. In the glaze-ice regime, instead, the liquid film over the wing moves toward the endwall and ice is formed in the shadow region.",54,2
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033998,"Before launching a scientific balloon, one needs to precisely predict its trajectory to avoid any possible accidents, as there are no means to control the horizontal motion of the balloon once it is launched. Although earlier studies developed simulation programs that predicted the trajectory of a scientific balloon with reasonable accuracy, the simulated results were hardly the same as the actual balloon flight because there existed uncertainties in balloon trajectory prediction. To address the difference between the predicted and actual flight trajectories, the prediction should be probabilistic, which means the uncertainties involved in the calculation should be taken into account. In the present work, a numerical simulation program is developed to predict the trajectories of a balloon, while considering various uncertainties, with the use of a Monte Carlo simulation. Sensitivity studies are performed to identify the most dominant uncertainty parameter in the distribution of landing points of the balloon flight. Operational uncertainty represented by the amount of buoyant gas is shown to be the most significant source of the prediction error, although it can be overcome by controlling the amount of lifting gas during the actual flight.",54,2

The study presents aeroelastic simulations of the full-span F-16 fighter computational model including a linear modal structural model and an aerodynamic wing model. The simulations are performed at flow conditions for which limit cycle oscillations were encountered in flight tests. The effects of dynamic pressure, structural damping, angle of attack, and turbulence modeling on the characteristics of the phenomenon are discussed. The relationship between flutter and limit cycle oscillations is investigated, and the origin of limit cycle oscillations is identified as nonlinear, self-sustained, periodic, shock-wave oscillations on the upper surface of the wing. These oscillations are suggested to suppress flutter into limit cycle oscillations.",54,2

As part of this theme, boundary-layer destabilizing effects of surface imperfections (assembly gaps, steps, rivets, waviness, and holes) have been investigated by ONERA scientists for many years. Experimental, numerical, and theoretical works provided fruitful results partly described in this paper, which especially focuses on gaps effects. Geometrical triggering criteria were searched and found to reproduce transition at a realistic chord percentage on reduced scale models. More recently, predicting the impact of gaps on laminar flow transition was also studied so as to provide a numerical tool for defining tolerances compatible with natural laminar flow airfoils. A specific model based on a approach has been developed to quantify the transition displacement caused by transverse gaps with a rectangular section. Detailed experimental studies that recently contributed to its validation are also presented in this paper.",54,2
