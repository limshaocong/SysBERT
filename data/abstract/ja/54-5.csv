0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034064,"Recent research has focused on the design of aircraft that provide significant reductions in emissions, noise, and fuel usage. One of the strategies to increase fuel efficiency is to leverage the potential structural weight saving available by using novel configurations such as the truss-braced wing. The Boeing Company recently tested the Subsonic Ultra-Green Aircraft Research Truss-Braced Wing wind-tunnel model in the NASA Langley Research Center Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. This test resulted in a wealth of accelerometer data that are indicative of the dynamic behavior of the model near flutter onset. For the truss-braced wing model test, the flutter onset was preceded by a large Mach number/dynamic pressure area in which the model displayed wing/engine nacelle aeroelastic limit-cycle oscillation. This paper analyzes those limit-cycle oscillation data to provide additional insights into the aeroelastic behavior of the model. Spectral analyses indicate the coalescence of several wing modes into a single-frequency limit-cycle oscillation. The mapping of limit-cycle oscillation at that frequency at progressive amplitudes indicates a substantial variation in onset with angle of attack. Spectral analysis also provides evidence of nonlinearity in both the aerodynamic and structural dynamics.",54,5

Using a flight dynamic model of the insect, which comes embedded with simplified quasi-steady wing aerodynamics and is coupled to high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics analysis, trim solutions are obtained in realistic time frames. This procedure is analogous to rotorcraft periodic coupling for trim. Six iterative coupling cycles are sufficient to obtain convergence in the wing loads and trim variables for the cases investigated. This multifidelity approach, where many quasi-steady calculations are combined with a judicious number of computational fluid dynamics simulations, may be used in parametric sweeps and design studies to improve hover and cruise performance. The trim variables chosen in this study are the parameters used to describe the wing kinematics (stroke amplitude , stroke flapping bias , and stroke plane tilt ). Flight conditions investigated are hover and three forward flight speeds. At hover, the wing kinematics parameters produce linearly independent force and moment components in the longitudinal plane. In forward flight, cross couplings manifest between the individual wing kinematics parameters and the longitudinal forces and moments. Thus, the one-to-one correlation between forces and individual controls that exists at hover is lost in forward flight.",54,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034189,"A recursive von Kármán turbulence model is developed and integrated into the current distributed turbulence model for helicopter flight simulation and handling quality analysis in atmospheric turbulence. First, high-order filters are developed with rational expressions to approximate the von Kármán spectra. Recursive algorithms for modeling the von Kármán turbulence are derived by discretizing the filters with the Tustin transform. Then, the recursive von Kármán turbulence model is used to replace the Dryden model in the current distributed turbulence model for helicopter flight simulation in atmospheric turbulence. The results show that the spectra of the recursive von Kármán turbulence have an excellent agreement with the theoretical von Kármán spectra, and they are valid over a normalized frequency range up to 400 rad, which is suitable for helicopter handling quality analysis in atmospheric turbulence with low flight speed and large turbulence scale lengths. The present turbulence model significantly extends the capability of helicopter handling quality analysis to the higher-altitude and lower-velocity flight conditions compared with the current distributed turbulence model.",54,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034115,"The flow angles calibration of air-data systems is based on the availability of high-accuracy reference measurements of angle-of-attack and sideslip angles. Typically, these are obtained by auxiliary sensors directly providing the reference angles (e.g., nose-boom vanes) or by analytically reconstructing them using calibrated airspeed measurements and inertial data. This paper proposes a novel approach in which the reference data for the flow angles calibration are obtained by inertial measurements only. The methodology, aiming to lower the development costs of advanced aircrafts, is developed and validated with reference to the triple-probe air-data system of a Piaggio Aerospace Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial System. Specific flight tests are carried out for the calibration process, by defining maneuvers that reduce flight time and facilitate the calibration itself. The technique is made of two steps: first, the aloft wind speed is estimated, and the angle-of-attack and sideslip angles are reconstructed; next, the reference data are used to define the calibration polynomials via least-mean squares approximation. The approach effectiveness is presented and discussed with reference to flight tests with three different configurations of flaps extension, by comparing the calibrated results with the data coming from high-accuracy nose-boom vanes.",54,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034048,"This paper presents compact forms for the monopole term of several of Farassat’s formulations. When the physical surface is elongated, such as in the case of a high aspect ratio rotorcraft blade, one can derive compact forms that are shown to be a function of the blade cross-sectional area by reducing the computation from a surface integral to a line integral. The compact forms of all formulations are applied to two example cases: a short span wing with constant airfoil cross-section moving at three forward flight Mach numbers and a rotor at two advance ratios. Acoustic pressure time histories and power spectral densities predicted from the compact forms are shown to resemble very closely the predictions from their noncompact counterparts. A study on the influence of the rotorcraft blade shape on the high-frequency content shows that there is a direct correlation between the aspect ratio of the airfoil and the error incurred. Finally, a prediction of the pressure gradient from the noncompact and compact forms of the thickness term of formulation G1A shows that using the compact forms results in a 99.6% improvement in computation time, which will be critical when noise is incorporated in a design environment.",54,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034156,"An evaluation and analysis of optimum wing spanloads was conducted by comparing wing performance values obtained from theoretical models and experimental wind-tunnel measurements. Three wing spanloads were designed for a prescribed lift and wing root bending moment using a Lagrange multiplier optimization method, with and without incorporating a representative viscous effect. Wind-tunnel models were constructed for each spanload, and experiments were conducted to determine the relative difference in drag measured as changes were made to the design constraints. The results indicate that, for a fixed lift and wing root bending moment, significant decreases in drag from an elliptically loaded wing are achievable by using a higher aspect ratio with a nonelliptic spanload. Under the fixed design constraints, a minimum drag wing was produced by balancing increases in profile drag and decreases in induced drag associated with a planar wing-tip extension. Experimental five-hole probe wake survey measurements were used to determine the spanwise lift distributions of the wing models, which were used to verify the conformity of the experimental spanloads to the predicted values.",54,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034337,"One of the main advancements of remotely piloted aircraft systems is their ability to carry different sensors and to surveil areas over long periods of time. Depending on the types of sensors applied, different automated flight maneuvers need to be planned and executed to acquire imagery that is meeting the missions’ objectives. These flight maneuvers are generally based on common military scan patterns (e.g., creeping-line and expanding square), and are chosen with regard to their respective advantages based on the mission characteristics. The calculation of these scan patterns requires a high accuracy and efficiency to provide optimal results and to maintain safety. In this paper, the results of flight experiments with a remotely piloted aircraft system (i.e., research aircraft demonstrating capabilities of a remotely piloted aircraft system) in non-segregated airspace are shown. In these experiments, flight paths for different scan patterns were calculated and validated in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and safety. In addition, different strategies for dynamically adapting the calculated flight path based on results from a real-time image analysis are described and evaluated.",54,5

Objectives of the experiment were to quantify the effects of Reynolds number, advance ratio, and hub geometry configuration on the drag and shed wake of the rotor hub. A range of flow conditions was tested, with hub-diameter-based Reynolds numbers ranging from to and advance ratios ranging from 0.2 to 0.6, as well as nonrotating cases. Five hub geometry configurations were tested with various combinations of components including blade stubs, spiders, scissors, the swashplate, pitch links, and beanie fairing. Measurements included the steady and unsteady hub drag and particle image velocimetry at two downstream locations. Results include time-averaged and phase-averaged analyses of the unsteady drag and wake velocity. A strong dependence of the steady and unsteady hub drag and wake on the advance ratio, Reynolds number, and configuration was observed, demonstrating the importance of adequate Reynolds number scaling for model helicopter rotor hub tests.",54,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033977,"The design and analysis of a simple jet noise reduction concept is discussed. The concept is intended for use on the type of supersonic exhaust nozzles typically employed on tactical aircraft. The concept addresses both broadband shock-associated noise and turbulent mixing noise. Broadband shock-associated noise is addressed through a reduction in the effective exhaust area, which reduces the strength of the shock cell structure in the jet. Turbulent mixing noise is reduced by enhancement of mixing in the jet shear layer, which creates a shorter region of strongly turbulent flow and breaks up the large-scale turbulent structures. This paper describes an active control device that deflects a fraction of the adjustable seals in the divergent section of the engine exhaust nozzle. After takeoff, the deflected seals are returned to their undeflected position. Very favorable jet noise reductions are demonstrated at multiple observer angles for nominal takeoff conditions.",54,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034195,"Tiltrotors can experience an aeroelastic instability called whirl flutter, which is characterized by highly coupled wing–rotor vibrations, which are catastrophic in nature and limit the maximum speed of the aircraft. In this paper, an optimization study aimed at improving the whirl flutter speed of a tiltrotor equipped with a wing extension and a winglet is presented. Parametric studies are conducted on an aeroelastic model of a rotor mounted on a cantilevered wing with an extension and a winglet. The parameters that are investigated are stiffness, structural taper, composite couplings, extension sweep, and winglet cant angle. It is found that, when the wing has a structural taper and is equipped with a wing extension and a winglet, the whirl flutter speed can be increased by 15%. The parametric study is followed by an optimization study to determine the optimal combinations of these parameters that maximize whirl flutter speed. Genetic algorithms are used for the optimization process. Upper and lower bounds are placed as constraints on the design variables. It is shown that the optimized design has a flutter speed of 22% (65 kt) more than the baseline.",54,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034084,"Accurate static-pressure measurements are a prerequisite for safe navigation and precise air-data measurements on aircraft. Pressure is also fundamental for wind and air temperature analysis in meteorology. Static-pressure measurement by aircraft is disturbed by aerodynamics and needs to be corrected using calibration. In this paper, a comparison has been made between static pressure measured by means of a trailing cone in the atmosphere behind two different jet aircraft at flight levels up to 450 and data from numerical weather predictions. The height is derived from differential Global Navigation Satellite System measurements. The Global Navigation Satellite System height is compared to numerical-weather-prediction geopotential height. The numerical-weather-prediction data were provided by the Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. When computing the geopotential with latitude-/height-dependent gravity, the pressure/height differences are and . This pressure accuracy implies numerical-weather-prediction temperature errors on average below 10 km altitude. The trailing-cone measurements provide a first quantification of the case-specific accuracy of numerical-weather-prediction pressure–geopotential relationships. The method of comparing operational pressure/Global Navigation Satellite System measurements on aircraft with numerical-weather-prediction analysis or predictions can be used to test the height-keeping performance of aircraft after or during operation.",54,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034205,"The main objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous coupling between body flight dynamics and flow dynamics (unsteady aerodynamics) in hovering of insects and flapping-wing micro air vehicles. A reduced-order unsteady aerodynamic model that takes into account the leading-edge vortex and rotational effects is integrated with a dynamic model to construct a flight dynamic model for flapping-wing micro air vehicles and insects near hover. Then, the averaging theorem is used to study the dynamic stability of such a nonlinear time-periodic system. Effects of unsteady aerodynamics on the trim/balance problem and stability of such an equilibrium are assessed. It is found that the flow dynamics induces asymmetric forward force and pitching moment, even though the flapping motion is symmetric. As such, balance of insects and flapping-wing micro air vehicles at hover cannot be achieved by purely symmetric flapping. Although unsteady aerodynamics considerably affects the balance/trim problem, its effect on stability is minor.",54,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033803,"Even with all the benefits an airports brings, it may produce significant impacts on those living nearby and on the environment. Lately, interest in this problem has intensified in connection with increasing air traffic (at a mean annual rate of 5–7%) and a growing public awareness of local air quality around the airports. An aircraft is an important source of air pollution in the vicinity of an airport. The PolEmiCa model uses semiempirical techniques to characterize the transportation of contaminants from the aircraft engine by jet plume and does not takes into account ground surface influence on the jet’s behavior and properties. Computational Fluid dynamics codes allow the investigation of the fluid mechanics aspects of the exhaust gas jet from an aircraft engine near the ground surface and estimates basic jet parameters (height and longitudinal coordinates of jet axis due to buoyancy effect, length of jet penetration, and dispersion characteristics) for inclusion in dispersion modeling of air pollution. This paper presents the results of complex PolEmiCa model improvements by including of assessment of ground impact on an aircraft engine jet using FLUENT 6.3 software. To reveal such an impact on the parameters of the jet, numerical simulations of turbulent free and wall jets are implemented in various wind conditions.",54,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034167,"The dynamics of a modern aircraft at high angles of attack is complicated, with hazardous phenomena such as wing rock, stall, and spin. The paper presents a technique for cost-effective and safe studying of conventional and critical flight regimes and control validation using an autonomous scaled aircraft model mounted in a three-degree-of-freedom gimbal in a wind tunnel. The similarity of the dynamics at high angles of attack of the wind-tunnel model and the free-flying model is demonstrated. To suppress the wing rock and to prevent the stall, two control laws are designed using linear matrix inequalities and model reference adaptive control techniques. The controllers are tested in a semifree flight of the autonomous scaled model in the wind tunnel. Wing rock suppression and stall and spin prevention are demonstrated.",54,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033991,"Flight data collected from a fleet of Beechcraft King Air airframes have been analyzed. The data consisted of information from 3094 flights in various missions flown for the U.S. Forest Service. The missions consisted of those in support of aerial firefighting as well as passenger and ferry operations. The 2 s rule for separation of gust and maneuver load factors has been examined and deemed adequate. Gust and maneuver loads spectra for ground–air–ground are shown to correlate better with altitude above ground than with altitude relative to mean sea level. The flights are separated into six specific phases, some of which are unique for firefighting missions. The incremental vertical gust loads are then used to find derived gust velocities for each flight phase and for the entire flight. The derived gust velocity spectra are shown to be independent of the flight phase and depend only on altitude. It is concluded that the development of such spectra for individual flight phases is unnecessary and that a single spectrum, showing altitude dependence, is equally applicable to all phases of flight.",54,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034120,"Oscillations of a wing-tip vortex over planes orthogonal to the freestream direction are typically ascribed to a specific fluid dynamic phenomenon, which is referred to as vortex wandering or meandering. Vortex wandering affects noticeably fixed-point measurements, producing measured vortices with larger size and weaker intensity than the actual ones, and thus methods for correction of wandering smoothing effects are needed. For this survey, the tip vortex generated from a tapered NACA 0012 half-wing is measured through the rapid scanning technique, which consists of quickly traversing a five-hole pressure probe through the vortex core to obtain velocity signals practically not affected by wandering. Rapid scanning allows evaluating probability distributions of the vortex center positions, which are found to be characterized by bivariate normal probability density functions. Estimate of wandering smoothing effects on fixed-point measurements is carried out by comparing rapid scanning data not affected by wandering with fixed-point three-sensor hot-film measurements. The vortex strength seems to be the main vortex parameter controlling wandering; wandering amplitude is reduced by increasing wing angle of attack or freestream velocity or by reducing streamwise distance from the wing. However, a sufficiently strong or concentrated vortex can be weakly affected by wandering.",54,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033917,"Typically, a limited number of dynamic pressure sensors is employed to determine the unsteady aerodynamic forces on large, slender aerospace structures. This paper describes a robust calculation procedure based on frequency-specific correlation lengths and validation from an experiment conducted on a flat panel coated with fast-response pressure-sensitive paint. The first part of the paper describes the procedure used to analyze the pressure-sensitive paint images and a calibration method using dynamic pressure transducers. Excellent comparison in spectra, coherence, and phase, measured via pressure-sensitive paint and dynamic pressure sensors, validates the pressure-sensitive paint data. The second part of the paper describes the buffet validation process, the first step of which was to use pressure histories from all pixels to determine the true force fluctuations. In the next step, only a selected number of pixels was chosen as virtual sensors, and a correlation-length-based buffet calculation procedure was applied to determine modeled force fluctuations. By progressively decreasing the number of virtual sensors, it was observed that the present calculation procedure was able to make a close estimate of the true unsteady forces only from eight sensors. It is believed that the present work provides the first validation of a buffet calculation procedure.",54,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033995,"Wake-vortex encounter reports as well as simulations show a significantly higher encounter probability during landing shortly before touchdown in comparison to other flight phases. This is caused, among other factors, by the special behavior of wake vortices in ground effect. Nevertheless, hazardous wake encounters with adverse consequences are rarely reported in reality. To gain more insight in the mechanisms of wake encounters close to ground, encounter simulations were performed with realistic vortex flowfields. These were generated using coupled Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and large-eddy simulations covering the whole vortex evolution in ground effect from generation until decay and were used for a hazard analysis. Encounter simulations were performed with a simulation model of an A320-size aircraft with autopilot engaged following an A340-size aircraft. Different wind conditions and vortex ages were considered as well as a so-called plate line. Recent studies showed increased vortex decay when a series of plates is positioned in front of the runway threshold. The results of the study reveal a significant reduction of the maximal vortex impact on the encountering aircraft due to the plate line. This effect is more pronounced for younger vortices, but also for operationally relevant vortex ages, a considerable effect of the plate lines in reducing the maximum aircraft reaction due to a wake encounter close to ground can be observed.",54,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034203,"The conceptual development, design, ground test, and flight test of a novel weapons-cavity acoustics store separation pod led to several positive outcomes to aid in the understanding of cavity–store interaction. The weapons-cavity acoustics store separation pod was a modified SUU-41 pod (suspended utility unit) instrumented to collect forces and accelerations on a scaled model missile. In addition, time-resolved pressure and qualitative flowfield imaging were captured for the scaled cavity. This research included seven test missions on the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The flight-test data indicate that there is a clear correlation between loads and missile acceleration. The normal force, pitch moment, and acceleration data acquired for difference missile model configurations within the cavity yielded considerable insight into possible complications relating to store release. Pressure transducer data indicated the frequency of Rossiter tones and corresponded closely to results anticipated from prior flights involving the SUU-41 pod. Correlation between pressure transducer and loads/acceleration acting on the missile model was found to occur most commonly around Rossiter mode 2, indicating mode matching.",54,5
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034286,"The ONERA 7A rotor wind-tunnel test data are investigated to assess the accuracy of analytical tools in the calculation of rotor airloads and structural loads. Comprehensive analysis codes, HOST and RCAS, and coupled computational fluid dynamics/comprehensive analysis codes, elsA/HOST and Helios/RCAS, are used to examine the ONERA 7A rotor-blade dynamics, trim, airloads, and structural loads, and the calculated results are compared with the measured data for both high-speed and high-thrust conditions. The present elsA and Helios analyses include the test-stand modeling. Comprehensive analyses show significant phase differences for the airloads and structural loads. The phase correlation is substantially improved by the coupled analyses for both high-speed and high-thrust conditions. In general, the coupled analyses also improve the half peak-to-peak correlation of structural loads compared to the comprehensive analyses. The majority of the predictions from the coupled analyses in half peak-to-peak blade structural loads are within 20% of the measured data. The present study shows unprecedented correlation of structural loads for the 7A rotor, consistently better than the previous structural loads correlation for the UH-60A rotor using Helios/RCAS analysis.",54,5

It is a very complex strongly nonlinear multiphysics process involving tire-generated water spray and engine ingestion. In this paper, an integrated simulation platform that combines the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method and the discrete phase model in a finite volume framework is developed to predict the complex physical interactions and processes. The smoothed particle hydrodynamics method is used to accurately predict the tire-generated water spray pattern, and the discrete phase model method is used to predict the droplets motion in the airflow field around the airplane. The initial conditions of the droplets in the discrete phase model method are provided by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics computations.

Characteristics of the portfolio selection problem are ideally addressed via multi-objective genetic algorithm optimization. Methodological and practical considerations of this approach are examined while generating meaningful insight specific to a set of aircraft technologies expected to mature over the coming decade. Results allow for a detailed characterization of the set of Pareto-optimal technology combinations in terms of its corners, underlying performance tradeoffs, and salient topological features. High-impact technologies are resolved in terms of their pervasiveness across solutions in regions of interest. Because relative-valued environmental objectives can be exploited by the optimizer, the analysis is repeated with absolute-valued analogs to examine how the choice of objectives in this respect can affect the selection of technologies. The effect of resource costs associated with each technology, additively compounded for technology combination solutions, is also examined in this context by expanding the method to include a resource constraint. Accordingly, general features of the Pareto frontier in the objective space are characterized for varying degrees of resource constraint stringency.",54,5
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034309,"Noise transmission into and radiation from a rectangular cavity through a flexible structure in a noisy/thermal environment at supersonic flow is studied. Most works in acoustic fluid/solid interaction have focused on linear models in the preflutter domain (stable region). In this paper, the pre-/postflutter regions are considered in a nonlinear study. The governing equations of a flexible panel are constructed using the von Kármán theory, the first-order piston theory, and a modal cavity formulation; also, a stationary-homogenous turbulent boundary layer is modeled based on experimental data through stochastic modeling. The thermal environment and external incident random noise are also considered, and the far-field sound is predicted with a boundary integral method. The Rayleigh–Ritz approach is adopted to discretize the partial differential equations of the acoustic fluid/solid interaction system, and the resulting ordinary differential equations are solved numerically by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. In the postflutter domain, the acoustic pressure in the cavity is nearly spatially uniform and has the highest sound pressure levels in the lower-frequency regions. In-plane thermal loading may increase the dominant frequency of the sound field, but it may decrease or increase the sound pressure level. Higher cavity modes are excited by the turbulent boundary layer and the incident random load in the preflutter domain.",54,5
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034276,"This paper investigates the possibility of improving aircraft landing-gear touchdown performance by adding an inerter alongside a linear passive shock strut. The inerter is a novel mechanical element with the property that the applied force is proportional to the relative acceleration between its terminals. A simplified landing-gear model is presented, and the baseline performance of a conventional oleo-pneumatic shock absorber is established. Candidate layouts with linear mechanical components including inerters are considered using three objective functions: the strut efficiency, the maximum strut load, and the maximum stroke. It is demonstrated that improved touchdown performance can be achieved with a linear inerter-based configuration. However, it is also observed that the potential energy stored in the gear at the end of the first compression stroke exceeds that of the baseline nonlinear system. This suggests a poorer elongation stage might be observed. To address this, an additional constraint on energy dissipation is then considered. To achieve a reduced potential energy, a double-stage compression spring is introduced. With this, inerter-based configurations that provide improvements for the performance indices of interest are identified and presented.",54,5
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034165,"This paper examines a quadcopter operating in the plus and cross configurations. The plus configuration generates a yaw moment when a pitch/roll control input is introduced; but, for the cross configuration, the pitch/roll control is decoupled from yaw. Although the collective revolutions-per-minute control requirement, pitch attitude, and power requirement versus flight speed are identical for both configurations, in forward flight, the plus configuration requires a larger pitch control input because it uses only two rotors and a compensatory yaw control input. Quadcopters display two oscillatory modes in hover, a longitudinal phugoid mode (coupling longitudinal translation and pitch), and a lateral phugoid mode (coupling lateral translation and roll). Both modes are stable, and their poles are coincident in hover. In forward flight, the modes are distinct, and the frequency and damping of both modes increase. The nature of the lateral phugoid mode in forward flight is very similar to hover, but the longitudinal phugoid mode now includes altitude change. Over a certain airspeed range, a couple of real poles combine to produce an oscillatory short-period mode. No significant difference is seen in the autonomous flight dynamic characteristics between the plus and cross configurations. Maximum pitching and rolling moments produced by the cross configuration are greater than those produced by the plus configuration because all four rotors are used.",54,5
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034239,The paper focuses on the design of nonlinear state feedback controllers to minimize the amplitude of limit cycle oscillations exhibited by nonlinear aeroelastic systems. Nonlinear normal modes are computed for the closed-loop system to represent the flutter mode dynamics using a single mode. The effectiveness of nonlinear normal modes as a tool to capture the limit cycle oscillation growth is demonstrated. The harmonic balance method is used to estimate the amplitude and frequency of the limit cycle oscillations exhibited by the flutter mode. Analytical estimates of sensitivities of limit cycle amplitude with respect to the introduced control parameters are derived and shown to match closely to the sensitivities computed numerically using the finite difference method on a time marching simulation of the complete aeroelastic system. A multi-objective optimization problem that minimizes the estimate of limit cycle oscillation amplitude and an approximate measure of control cost is solved using the analytical sensitivities. Numerical simulation results are used to verify that minimizing the estimate of the limit cycle amplitude of the flutter nonlinear normal mode corresponds closely to minimizing the simulated limit cycle amplitude of the complete aeroelastic system.,54,5
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034288,"A vorticity-based exact theory for the analysis of the aerodynamic force is here applied to three-dimensional aircraft configurations in steady transonic flow by postprocessing numerical solutions. A rigorous and unambiguous definition of lift-induced drag in compressible flows and its distinction from the profile component have been obtained. The equation is based on field integrals of the Lamb vector field highlighting the generation of the aerodynamic force in the rotational part of the flow only. Encountered numerical difficulties, arisen in high-transonic flow conditions, are first described. They have been overcome by a proper treatment of the numerical integration in the shock region where the accuracy of the numerical flow solution is poorer. Thus, a new exact formula is obtained for an accurate aerodynamic force computation in high-transonic and supersonic flows. In addition, a proper identification of the shock wave wake in the numerical solution allows for the decomposition of the profile drag in viscous and wave contributions. Applications are shown in the case of airfoil, elliptic wing and for the NASA Common Research Model wing–body configuration. Comparisons with classical drag breakdown methods are presented and the improvements obtained in the lift-induced drag analysis are discussed.",54,5

Four flap angles and three hinge locations were evaluated. The leading-edge suction analogy was extended to allow estimation of the effect of flaps on both the attached flow and vortex lift components. Additionally, expressions to estimate the drag and pitching moment coefficient were also developed. Comparisons of theory and experiment showed close accord. Flap deflection was observed to cause a notable reduction in the drag coefficient for a given lift coefficient. Wing stall, however, was observed at lower angles of attack than without the flap, caused by an earlier onset of vortex breakdown.",54,5

In the flow past the A-Airfoil, comparisons with surface skin-friction coefficient and pressure coefficient distribution are generally in good agreement with experimental measurements. Comparisons with experimental velocity profile data and Reynolds-stress data are also generally favorable. Leading-edge laminar separation and turbulent reattachment is predicted when the Menter–Langtry correlation-based transition model is used in combination with either Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes or large-eddy/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes strategies, but the level of trailing-edge separation is underpredicted, relative to experimental data and to results obtained without the inclusion of transition model. For the case of flow past a NACA 0012 airfoil under static stall conditions, results from the large-eddy/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations exhibit a sensitivity to mesh refinement, with finer spanwise mesh resolution leading to light stall, characterized primarily by trailing-edge separation, and coarser spanwise mesh resolution leading to deep stall, characterized by the presence of a stabilized leading-edge vortex. Calculations that include wind-tunnel wall effects show better general agreement with experimental measurements but also display the aforementioned sensitivity to spanwise mesh refinement.",54,5
