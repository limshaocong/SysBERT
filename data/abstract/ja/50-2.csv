Aerodynamic control surfaces and actuators may have excessive free play in connecting joints and hinges, which has the potential to cause limit-cycle oscillations associated with aeroservoelastic vibrations, impacting handling and ride quality and leading to structural fatigue. Because of these negative impacts, free-play limits have been established by the Joint Services Guidance Military Specification. These military specifications have also been adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration for commercial aircraft. This stringent requirement can be excessively conservative and is very difficult and costly to meet. Analytical tools using describing functions have been developed to establish free-play limits on aeroservoelastic aircraft systems without adverse consequences. These tools are robust and easy to implement, justifying relaxation or validation of the conservative requirements. It is shown that oscillation frequency and amplitude can be accurately estimated using describing functions with an analytical model of an aeroservoelastic system with free play. A novel analysis technique is also demonstrated, whereby free-play occurrence and limit-cycle behavior can be visualized using time-varying frequency content. Validation of the method is illustrated with an aeroservoelastic stabilator control surface model using nonlinear simulation, with free-play limits found in experimental conditions.",50,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031456,"The term ‘morphing aircraft’ describes a broad range of air vehicles and vehicle components that adapt to planned and unplanned multipoint mission requirements. Adaptation or morphing requires changing system features including vehicle ‘states,’ such as vehicle shape, during in-flight operation. The term morphing can be applied to almost any activity in which in-flight vehicle features are changed. As such, morphing has become a buzzword loosely applied to a wide variety of activities, some of which are disconnected from air vehicle morphing development. This has led to three myths: 1) morphing shape change is too expensive, 2) morphing aircraft must weigh more than nonmorphing aircraft, and 3) morphing requires exotic materials and complex systems. This paper attempts to dispel these myths by reviewing early morphing aircraft history to identify inventions and innovations that led to both successes and failures. The review also discusses recent government-sponsored activities in the United States: in particular, morphing systems development sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency viewed from the author’s perspective as a former Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Program Manager. The review concludes with identification of possible avenues for future morphing aircraft evolution and morphing device development.",50,2

The investigation was carried out via solving the three-dimensional Euler equation with the OVERFLOW-2 flow solver. The computational meshes were created using the Chimera overset grid topology. The lift distribution was varied by deflecting the canard, then trimming the aircraft with the wing and the stabilator while maintaining a constant lift coefficient of 0.05. A wide range of streamwise lift distributions was simulated. The results show that the relative longitudinal wave propagation speed can be controlled through lift distribution, thus controlling the shock coalescence and sonic boom signature. In addition, validation studies of the computational tools were performed using a wing-body model and the results were compared against the wind-tunnel experimental data. The same model was also used to perform the grid resolution and numerical scheme comparison study.",50,2

The first publicly charted optimized profile descent procedure was implemented at Los Angeles International Airport in December 2007. This new flight procedure was designed so that aircraft could conduct arrival and approach operations with the engines remaining at or near minimum idle power settings; thereby, saving an average of 25 gal of jet fuel per flight when compared to the various aircraft types conducting an arrival and approach along the same lateral path at Los Angeles International Airport. This optimized profile descent translates into annual reductions of approximately 2,000,000 gal of jet fuel and 41,000,000 lb of carbon dioxide emissions. Given the positive environmental benefits of an optimized profile descent, there are several projects underway to increase the use of environmentally friendly arrival procedures within the national airspace system. The aforementioned achievement at Los Angeles International Airport has motivated and enabled new optimized profile descent procedure designs for Atlanta, Miami, Charleston, and Phoenix.",50,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031690,"Highly complex and coupled nature of the National Airspace System makes it challenging to understand the safety implications of changes to its operations. A comprehensive assessment of the hazards associated with the introduction of new technologies must involve modeling of interactions among aircraft behavior, supporting infrastructure, and the operational procedures. The traditional approach to risk assessment does not focus on the relative timing of relevant events. The likelihoods of those events are computed externally, usually by means of physics-based simulations, which, while increasingly realistic in capturing physical phenomena, are limited to describing only few relevant interactions to keep the overall complexity tractable. This paper discusses an intermediate layer of analysis with enough fidelity to capture time-dependent coupling among relevant entities of the system that is compact enough to track a large number of those relevant entities simultaneously. To this end, Stochastic Petri nets are used to analyze the conflict resolution between the merging flows of air traffic for optimized-profile-descent approaches. Stochastic Petri nets are coupled with agent-based simulation, and the efficiency of the merging procedures and their sensitivity to wind conditions and the traffic patterns are analyzed. Finally, compact modeling of two off-nominal scenarios related to future procedures is discussed.",50,2

The variation of the aerodynamic characteristics at different canard positions is the focus of the present investigation. The aerodynamic interference and the mutual coupling effect between the canard and wing will have great influences on the lift, drag, and sideslip characteristics of the whole aircraft. The canard-generated vortex can induce a favorable interference onto the main wing, controlling the onset of the boundary layer separation from the leading edge. At small angles of attack ( the aerodynamic characteristics are sensitive to the relative position of the canard and the wing, but at high angles of attack ( they are not only related to the orientation of the canard (forward or backward), but also the features of the vortices generated above the canard and the wing, including their strength and location.",50,2

Three levels of grid resolution were employed in that simulation, and the far-field analysis successfully obtained values close to the converged drag values estimated by near-field analysis of the convergence study for all levels of grid. Drag decomposition by the far-field analysis also revealed which parts of the flow and which components of the drag varied with angle of attack. Visualized images of drag production were obtained from the far-field analysis and gave good insight into drag production.",50,2

Both turret geometries use a flat-window aperture with an aperture ratio (ratio of the aperture diameter to the turret diameter) of 0.295 and an elevation angle of 57 deg. The forward field of regard was the particular focus in this study, and both symmetric (azimuth angle of 0 deg) and asymmetric (azimuth of 45 deg) window orientations were examined. Two flight conditions were also studied: a subsonic case with and and a transonic case with and . The flowfield was simulated using the delayed detached-eddy simulation capability of OVERFLOW in conjunction with the spatially fifth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme to capture the off-body vortical structures.

Point-mass flight dynamic model and a set of approximate analytical methods for structural analysis are used in the development. Estimated damage parameters are used to determine the aircraft aerodynamic, structural, structural dynamic, and aeroelastic parameters.

9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031851,"In the present work, generalized aerodynamic forces concerning the time and frequency domains are analyzed. Thereby, the transonic flow regime is of main interest. For this purpose, the low-frequency structural modes of the AGARD 445.6 wing and a wing–fuselage configuration known as the fuselage cropped delta wing are used to compute the corresponding generalized aerodynamic forces with the Euler methods AER-Eu (nonlinear, time domain) and AER-SDEu (linear, frequency domain). Furthermore, a reduced-order model based on the AER-Eu solver is generated as a linear state-space model for fast computations of generalized aerodynamic forces in the discrete time domain. This is realized by recording the responses of the AER-Eu solver to a set of orthogonal step functions. The resulting time series are further processed to extract the impulse responses required for the system identification with the Eigensystem-Realization Algorithm. The transfer of the time domain results into frequency domain is achieved via the Fourier analysis of the time series of the harmonic responses and the extracted impulse responses for modal movement of the body. It is shown that the linear state-space reduced-order model based on appropriate computational-fluid-dynamics conditioning is an efficient way for the computation of generalized aerodynamic forces required in linear aeroelastic analysis.",50,2

Different arrangements of each device were tested on a semi-span wing, with additional investigations performed on a half-body model of a trainer aircraft. Results include: aerodynamic coefficients; surface pressure distributions; and wake surveys with a multi-hole Pitot probe. The influence of each wing-tip arrangement on aircraft performance was estimated, considering the energy requirements of the blowing system. All devices tested were able to minimize induced drag; however, for practical applications in commercial airplanes, multi-winglets are a more promising alternative due to the large amount of energy required by wing-tip blowing.",50,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031880,"In this work, the performance of the assumed-transition-point criterion, in conjunction with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations is evaluated over the hull of a lighter-than-air vehicle. The evaluation is performed by comparing the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations of drag, lift, and moment coefficients against those measured in experiments where 1) transition is forced to occur (forced-transition case) and 2) transition is allowed to occur naturally (free-transition case). It was found that by using the assumed-transition-point criterion Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations satisfactorily recover the drag coefficient both at zero angle of attack and nonzero angles of attack up to five degrees when compared against the forced-transition case. However, irrespective of the location of the assumed transition point, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes fails to recover the experimentally observed values of the force and moment coefficients for the free-transition case. At this point, it is not clear if this failure is attributable to the assumed-transition-point criterion or to the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes framework itself. A similar systematic evaluation with more scale resolving computational fluid dynamics methods (large eddy simulation or bridging methods) may be helpful in ascertaining the reason of this failure.",50,2

Pratt method is a quasi-static approach that forms the basis for Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23 gust loads certification requirements. This work evaluates the usefulness of Pratt method for unconventional high-altitude long-endurance aircraft. The derivation of Pratt method is reviewed, and all assumptions are identified. Error of a key curve fit equation is quantified directly. A state-of-the-art nonlinear aeroelastic code was upgraded and used to facilitate quantification of application-dependent errors by comparing quasi-static results to results from nonlinear transient analysis. Application-dependent errors are presented in the context of a SensorCraft-inspired joined-wing model and a Helios-aircraft-inspired flying-wing model. Recommendations are made on the usability of Pratt method for aircraft similar to the two high-altitude long-endurance models. It is concluded that Pratt method is useful for preliminary design of the joined-wing model but inadequate for the analysis of the flying-wing model. Further recommendations are made regarding the subtleties in the implementation of Pratt method for unconventional configurations.",50,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031888,"This paper describes the methodology for synthesis of structural strains during flight using recorded flight parameters of a fighter aircraft. This technique can be applied to regenerate data in the event of data loss due to faults in transmission or recording or due to faulty strain gauges. In such a case, flight parameters recorded during the flight can be employed to synthesize the strain response at the structural locations for which the data loss is observed. Artificial neural networks are used in this study to model and synthesize structural strain response using a prescribed set of flight parameters. The approach is demonstrated through the examples of typical wing root and fin root fittings of a fighter aircraft. The neural network model is developed using available data of an instrumented aircraft. The results provide not only the proof-of-concept but also indicate the acceptable efficacy of the model in terms of the accuracy of predictions. Accuracy of predictions is used to identify a more suitable set of flight parameters for efficient implementation of this model. Predicted strain responses for a number of flights are shown to be within 7% of the measured data for the entire flight duration.",50,2

When looking for the best match between visual and inertial amplitude in a simulator, researchers have found that there is a range of inertial amplitudes, rather than a single inertial value, that is perceived by subjects as optimal. This zone, hereafter referred to as the optimal zone, seems to correlate to the perceptual coherence zones measured in flight simulators. However, no studies were found in which these two zones were compared. This study investigates the relation between the optimal and the coherence-zone measurements within and between different simulators. An experiment was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center, where two simulators were used to measure the optimal and the coherence zone in the sway axis. Results show that the optimal zone lies within the coherence zone. The center of the optimal zone is significantly lower than the center of the coherence zone. In addition, it was found that, whereas the width of the coherence zone depends on the visual amplitude and frequency, the width of the optimal zone remains constant. No statistical differences between the two simulators were found.",50,2

The partially active surface is designed to have sufficient bending stiffness in the chordwise direction to sustain chordwise shape under aerodynamic loading. In contrast, the in-plane stiffness is relatively high; however, the necessary deformations that are required to change the aerodynamic response can still be attained while maintaining the surface perimeter constant. Coupled with two carefully selected boundary conditions, the proposed piezocomposite airfoil can achieve significant change in aerodynamic response. The surface geometry properties are determined using a genetic algorithm optimization method. The optimization is conducted to achieve maximum change of lift-output-per-square-root-of-drag, which is the difference in the aerodynamic response for the airfoil at maximum excitation with asymmetric profile and zero excitation with symmetric profile. A coupled analysis of the fluid–structure interaction is employed assuming static-aeroelastic behavior, which allows the realization of a design that can sustain aerodynamic loads. The theoretical response is supplemented with extensive bench-top and wind-tunnel experiments conducted on a prototype airfoil. The experimental results are compared to the theoretical predictions, highlighting agreements and discrepancies.",50,2

18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031914,"Low-fidelity analytical models are often used at the conceptual aircraft design stage. Because of uncertainties on these models and their corresponding input variables, deterministic optimization may achieve under-design or over-design. Therefore it is important to already consider these uncertainties at the conceptual design stage in order to avoid inefficient design and then costly time over runs due to re-design. This paper presents a procedure for reliable and robust optimization of an aircraft at the conceptual design phase. Uncertainties on model and design variables are taken into account in a probabilistic setting. More precisely, at each point of the optimization process uncertainties are modeled by an adaptive normal law strategy in order to fit the historical aircraft database. The statistical parameters are adjusted depending on the available information at the current point of the optimization process. To improve computational cost, response surface approximations are constructed to represent reliability constraints. The developed methodology is applied to the conceptual design of a short range aircraft. Compared to standard deterministic optimization without design margins, the result shows a modest increase on weight, which allows however to ensure a desired reliability and robustness of the design compared to the unreliable and sensitive deterministic optimum.",50,2

The bearingless rotor usually features a significantly large elastic twist in the flexbeam and additional unique structural characteristics. Thus, it will require sophisticated structural analysis and relevant numerical validation procedures due to its multiple load paths, as induced by the single or multiple flexbeams and the torque tube. In this paper, an extended finite element formulation was derived to consider the multiple components as individual beam elements. A geometrically exact beam formulation was adopted to describe the nonlinear behavior of these major components in the rotor precisely. To implement the interconnecting kinematic relationship with the major components, Lagrange multipliers were used. The present static analysis was validated through comparisons with the existing multi-body dynamics analysis DYMORE. Additional results were obtained for rotating conditions in both a vacuum and a set atmosphere in a wind tunnel. Finally, an experimental full-scale bearingless rotor system was coupled with finite-state dynamic inflow aerodynamics to simulate forward flight. The present predictions of the rotor responses and aerodynamics were well correlated with those by CAMRAD II.",50,2

The maneuver rig enables a large set of conventional and more-extreme aircraft maneuvers to be performed in the controlled environment of a wind tunnel, allowing direct physical simulation of in-flight maneuvers and the identification of aerodynamic models from aircraft-model time histories. A mathematical model of the rig has been developed for numerical simulation and identification purposes. The development of a quasi-steady aerodynamic model of the longitudinal motion for a subscale test aircraft is presented to illustrate rig capabilities. The longitudinal modes of motion are excited by a remotely controlled aircraft-model stabilator and dynamic-rig aerodynamic compensator deflections. Two rig configurations are considered: aircraft-model pitch only and aircraft-model pitch with heave, which is implemented via rig-pitch motion. The aircraft-model tail and wing in the mathematical model are considered separately to assist in identifying and pitch-rate stability derivatives. The results of parameter estimation are presented with analysis of their accuracy.

The process uses a technique shown previously to enable the detection of machined gaps in the same joint type. This technique involves computing the frequency spectra of the process forces and reducing the dimensions of the data using well-known methods for discrimination purposes. Aluminum alloys 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 in 0.063-in.- (1.6-mm-) thick sheets were welded with a variety of PR-1432-GP sealant configurations, including in both the cured and uncured state, and applied in the tool path and adjacent to the tool path. It is shown that sealant flaws such as gaps or thin spots can indeed be discriminated from control welds with proper sealant application, and the success of this technique depends directly on the input force signal, the sealant configuration, and the dimensional reduction method.

Detailed comparisons are made on rotor thrust, control angles, power, and section loads to illustrate and understand unique aeromechanics phenomena in this regime.

The unsteady pressure on the pitching-airfoil surface is measured through pressure-distortion correction in the pneumatic tubing, and the pressure-distortion characteristics are estimated. The unsteady pressure on the pitching airfoil is significantly delayed with reduced frequency, and the nondimensional time delay is evaluated with respect to unsteady pressure. The hysteresis loops of the lift and pressure-drag coefficients rotate in counterclockwise and clockwise directions, respectively, and this is due to the reattachment during downstroke. Moreover, the angle of attack range, in which aerodynamic performance is nonlinearly varied, is generated due to the nonlinear boundary-layer behavior caused by the low-Reynolds-number effect.

25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031969,"The weight and power constraints imposed on flapping-wing micro air vehicles necessitate optimal design of the flapping kinematics. To date, the approach adopted for kinematics optimization has been to assume specific functions for the Euler angles describing the wing motion with respect to the body. Then, optimization is performed on the parameters of these functions. In another approach, a number of instants over the flapping cycle are selected, and optimization is performed on the magnitude of the Euler angles at these instants. This latter approach provides more freedom for the variations of the Euler angles rather than confining them to certain patterns. Yet, in both approaches, finite-dimensional optimization is adopted and, as such, additional constraints are imposed. Considering that the problem is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we use in this work the calculus of variations to obtain true optimality. The combination of the quasi-steady aerodynamics and the calculus of variations approach yields an upper bound for the flapping-wing aerodynamic performance. This bound can be used as a basis for evaluating the performance of any realistic design by assessing the degree of closeness between that design and the true optimal performance.",50,2

Winglets reduce wing-induced drag but may reduce flutter speed, requiring wing stiffening and a structural weight penalty. Whereas the number of successful aircraft with winglets suggests that many flutter studies have been done, few of these studies appear in the archival literature. This paper investigates the effect of tip-fin surface geometry on flutter as well as on directional stability. The study includes the effects of tip-fin cant angle with respect to the primary surface and fin size with respect to the wing itself. Two idealized models, a simple four degree-of-freedom Rayleigh–Ritz model and a high-fidelity finite element model, illustrate special features of tip-fin aeroelasticity. Results indicate that the interaction between tip fins and the wing flexibility usually leads to reduced flutter speeds but can also create phenomena such as mode switching that actually increases flutter speed if the fin is large enough. Classical wing-surface lift ineffectiveness due to aeroelastic interaction also reduces directional stability.",50,2

Physical phenomena are poorly understood in the context of active flaps including vorticity and acoustics, separation, and transition. In addition, discrete trailing-edge flaps create a cavity-like flow within the airfoil-flap gap that can complicate these phenomena. This work has explored the physical response of a static airfoil with a discrete noncontoured oscillating flap over a range of freestream parameters. The effects of attached and separated flows, flap oscillation scheduling, airfoil-flap gap size, and freestream speed have all been investigated. Time-accurate predictions were performed using a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large eddy simulation turbulence model. Trailing-edge stall suppression and an increase between aerodynamic response and deflection input were observed as the flap oscillation frequency increased. The lag between response and input also increased approximately linearly with airfoil-flap gap size. Results indicated the transition was unaffected by the flap oscillations. During the frequency content of flow the unsteadiness was consistent with separated flow driven by the flap. Discrete noncontoured flaps are not recommended; if they are required, the size of the gap should be minimized to maintain performance and reduce lag.",50,2
