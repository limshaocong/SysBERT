Furthermore, assessment of aircraft utilization by airlines would guide future policies and investment decisions on technologies most urgently required. This paper describes the development of the Fleet-Level Environmental Evaluation Tool, which is a computational simulation tool developed to assess the impact of new aircraft concepts and technologies on aviation’s impact on environmental emissions and noise. This tool uses an aircraft allocation model that represents the airlines’ profit-seeking operational decisions as a mixed-integer programming problem. The allocation model is embedded in a system-dynamics framework that mimics the economics of airline operations, models their decisions regarding retirement and acquisition of aircraft, and estimates market demand growth. This paper describes the development of Fleet-Level Environmental Evaluation Tool to use a single large airline to represent operations of all airlines in the United States aviation market. The paper also demonstrates Fleet-Level Environmental Evaluation Tool’s capabilities using scenarios on the assessment of effects of new technology aircraft and biofuels on aviation’s emissions.",54,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034122,"Hypersonic vehicle design and simulation require models that are of low order. Modeling of hypersonic vehicles is complicated due to complex interactions between aerodynamic heating, heat transfer, structural dynamics, and aerodynamics in the hypersonic regime. This work focuses on the development of efficient modal solutions for structural dynamics of hypersonic vehicle structures under transient thermal loads. The problem is outlined, and aerothermoelastic coupling mechanisms are described. A previously developed reduced-order time-domain aerothermoelastic simulation framework is used as the starting point for this study. This paper focuses on two main modeling areas: 1) a surrogate modeling technique is employed for directly updating the generalized stiffness matrix and thermal loads based on the transient temperature distribution, and 2) basis augmentation techniques are employed in order to obtain more accurate solutions for the structural dynamic response. The techniques to be studied are described and applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle all-movable lifting surface.",54,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033902,"This paper summarizes the results of investigations into the development of parametric waverider geometry models, with emphasis on their efficiency, in terms of their ability to cover a large feasible design space with a sufficiently small number of design variables to avoid the “curse of dimensionality.” The work presented here is focused on the parameterization of idealized waverider forebody geometries that provide the baseline shapes upon which more sophisticated and realistic hypersonic aircraft geometries can be built. Three different aspects of rationalizing the decisions behind the parametric geometry models developed using the osculating cones method are considered. Initially, three different approaches to the design method itself are discussed. Each approach provides direct control over different aspects of the geometry for which very specific shapes would be more complex to obtain indirectly, thus enabling the geometry to more efficiently meet any related design constraints. Then, a number of requirements and limitations are investigated that affect the available options for the parametric design-driving curves of the inverse design method. Finally, the performance advantages that open up with increasing flexibility of the design-driving curves in the context of a design optimization study are estimated. This allows one to reduce the risk of overparameterizing the geometry model, while still enabling a variety of meaningful shapes. Although the osculating cones method has mainly been used here, most of the findings also apply to other similar inverse design algorithms.",54,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033908,"This paper seeks to quantify the uncertainty associated with atmospheric conditions when propagating shaped pressure disturbances from a vehicle flying at supersonic speeds. A discrete adjoint formulation is used to obtain sensitivities of boom metrics to atmospheric inputs such as temperature, wind, and relative humidity profiles in addition to deterministic inputs such as the near-field pressure distribution. This study uses a polynomial chaos theory approach to couple these adjoint-derived gradients with uncertainty quantification to enable robust design by using gradient-based optimization techniques. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated over an axisymmetric body of revolution and a low-boom concept. Results show that the mean and standard deviation of sonic-boom loudness are simultaneously reduced using robust optimization. Unlike the conventional optimization approaches, the robust optimization approach has the added benefit of generating probability distributions of the sonic-boom metrics under atmospheric uncertainty.",54,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033972,"An inverse low-boom design method using a reversed equivalent area based on off-body pressure distributions is effective because this method captures three-dimensional effects in a flowfield. In this paper, a robust low-boom design method using is proposed to consider off-track sonic boom loudness. Computing costs are reduced by applying multipole analysis, which allows the capture of three-dimensional effects, even when an off-body location is close to a body. In terms of robustness, it is difficult to set feasible target distributions in a whole boom carpet. Unfeasible targets may lead to results contrary to the design intent. Thus, the target is imposed only on the undertrack distribution. In addition, second derivatives of having direct relation to the function are controlled in the whole boom carpet. As a result, second derivatives are successfully controlled as intended by free-form deformation and genetic-algorithm-based optimization. The undertrack meets the target with acceptable deviation as well. As compared with the undertrack low-boom design, the robust design reduces the maximum perceived level in the whole boom carpet by 1.5 dB.",54,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033916,"Because of the skidding process that occurs when a heavy aircraft’s main landing gear tires touchdown, since the 1940s, a number of ideas have been patented to improve tire safety and decrease the substantial wear and smoke during every landing by spinning the gear wheels before touchdown. In this paper, a coupled structural–thermal transient analysis in ANSYS has been used to model a single wheel main landing gear as a mass-spring system. This model has been chosen to analyze the wheel’s dynamic behavior and tire tread temperature during the short period from static to a matching free-rolling velocity in which the wheel is forced to accelerate by the friction between the tire and ground. The tire contact surface temperature has been calculated for both the initially static and prespun wheels in order to compare the temperature levels for different initial rotations and to validate the use of the prespinning technique.",54,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033572,"The reduction of fleetwide environmental impacts through vehicle technologies and concepts is a global imperative. Fleet-level environmental impact modeling is governed by computational resource limitations and the tradeoff between breadth and depth. Unlike screening fidelity models, detailed models typically cannot support probabilistic analysis of forecast parameters (i.e., operations, fleet mix, technology-aircraft market penetration, etc.) due to their high run time. Moreover, both levels of fidelity currently rely on the selection of a small set of point-design technology aircraft, disabling the ability to assess technology-aircraft environmental performance and forecast parameters simultaneously. In this paper, a rapid, integrated, and interdependent fleet-level environmental modeling framework that addresses these shortcomings is presented. The model consists of several screening fidelity modeling enablers developed in prior work, combined with parameterized joint probability distributions to bridge the gap between aircraft and fleet-level probabilistic assessment. Copulas are used to enforce a prescribed dependence between two probability distributions and facilitate the characterization of complex and uncertain interactions in fleet-level assessment. This paper explains the building blocks of the framework in detail, followed by their conceptual structuring. Finally, notional simplified use cases of the model are presented to demonstrate the different types of interdependencies that can be assessed probabilistically.",54,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033832,"Governmental organizations are currently developing standards for civil unmanned aircraft to operate safely in the national airspace. A key requirement for aircraft certification is reliability assessment. Traditional reliability assessment methods make assumptions that are overly restrictive when applied to unmanned aircraft. This paper presents a step-by-step, model-based, reliability assessment method that is tailored for unmanned aircraft. In particular, this paper investigates the effects of stuck actuator faults (a common failure mode in electromechanical actuators) on the overall reliability. Several candidate actuator architectures, with different numbers of controllable surfaces, are compared to gain insight into the effect of actuator placement on reliability. It is assumed that a fault detection algorithm is available and affected by known rates of false alarms and missed detections. The overall reliability is shown to be dependent on several parameters, including hardware quality, fault detection performance, mission profile, flight envelope, and operating point. In addition to being an analysis tool, the method can help understand aircraft design tradeoffs.",54,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033883,"This paper presents an improved Neumann expansion method for calculating statistical moments of either a structural response or system inverse matrix under stochastic uncertainties in system properties and loads. The essentials of the proposed method are the successive matrix inversion and partial bivariate dimension reduction method that enable efficient multidimensional probability integration. The successive matrix inversion computes an exact realization of a stochastic system response, or an inverse matrix, by using the concept of inverse Neumann expansion. In characterizing the stochastic response, multidimensional probability integration is solved for statistical moments and covariance matrices. The existing univariate decomposition method is highly efficient to approximate the multidimensional integration. However, due to the missing interaction effects, the univariate decomposition method could lead to a huge error. In this study, a partial bivariate decomposition method is proposed to capture bivariate interaction effects approximately with a marginal increase in computational cost. Several numerical examples, including representative structural problems, are discussed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method compared with other existing methods. It is found that the proposed method provides better accuracy with significant computational cost savings when random fluctuations make locally limited changes in a system.",54,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033872,"This paper investigates the aerodynamic performance of a semiflexible membrane wing concept using twoway coupled fluid–structure interaction simulations. The sailwing concept consists of a rigid leading-edge mast, ribs, tensioned edge cables, and membranes forming the upper- and lower-wing surfaces. For membrane structures like the sailwing, the exact shape of the membrane surface in the absence of external loading depends on the prestress levels of both membranes and supporting edge cables. A form-finding analysis is used for calculating the equilibrium shape of prestressed membrane surfaces with no external loading. The exact shape of the sailwing in operating condition depends on the pressure distribution on the membrane’s surface, which itself depends on the wing’s shape and the structural parameters. For faster design space exploration, the fluid problem is modeled using an unsteady vortex panel method. Among all the factors influencing the fluid–structure interaction problem, the role of the prestress level is specifically investigated. A nonlinear dynamic analysis of the structural problem is performed using the finite element method. The influence of the wing’s flexibility on its aerodynamic performance and structural response is examined by changing the prestress level in the membranes. Aerodynamic characteristics of the membrane wing are compared with an equivalent conventional rigid wing. A higher lift slope for the membrane wing and improvement of the lift coefficient due to trailing-edge flexibility are observed.",54,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033973,"The design of plate lines as a ground-mounted device for wake-vortex decay enhancement is investigated in this work. The most important design parameters, the aspect ratio and plate distance, are analyzed for the wake vortices generated by two aircraft: the A340 as well as the A380. Large-eddy-simulations are used to simulate the wake-vortex evolution in ground proximity for different parameter combinations. Fully rolled-up wake vortices are initialized using a Lamb–Oseen vortex model resembling the characteristics of the two aircraft. With the stochastic so-called kriging method, estimates of the performance and respective probabilistic envelopes are given for the design parameter region, spanned by the large-eddy-simulation. The vortex circulation averaged over the rapid decay phase is taken as the objective function. The large-eddy-simulation parameters are selected in the vicinity of the expected optimum. An optimal parameter combination can be localized in the A340 case, as well as in the A380 case. For both cases, statistical relevance is provided. Moreover, it can be deduced that the optimal parameters for the A380 are also well suited for smaller aircraft like an A340.",54,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033838,"The design of vortex generators on a tiltrotor-aircraft infinite wing is presented using an adaptive surrogate modeling approach. Particular design issues in tiltrotors produce wings that are thick and highly loaded, and so separation and early-onset buffet can be problematic, and vortex generators are commonly used to alleviate these issues. In this work, the design of vortex generators for the elimination of separation is considered using a viscous flowfield simulation. A large design space of rectangular vane-type vortex generators is sampled and simulated, and a radial-basis-function surrogate model is implemented to model the full design space. An efficient adaptive sampling approach for improved design space sampling has also been developed that balances the properties of space filling, curvature capture, and optimum locating. This approach has been tested on the design of a vortex generator on a highly loaded infinite wing, with a representative tiltrotor airfoil section, using a five-dimensional design space. The design of the vortex generators using this approach shows that elimination of the separation is possible while simultaneously reducing the drag of the wing with optimized vortex generators, compared to the clean wing.",54,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033941,"This paper examines the application of formation flight to micro air vehicles with regard to possible power savings. Results of an experimental investigation on echelon formations using low-aspect-ratio flat plate rectangular wings at low Reynolds number are presented. One-, two-, and three-wing configurations are tested in a low-speed wind tunnel. To quantify the power savings by lift enhancement and drag reduction, the aerodynamic loads acting on each wing are measured using specific balances while the trailing wings of the formation are being traversed laterally and vertically in fine steps. In addition, the flowfields of the wing wakes are measured using particle image velocimetry. The force and flowfield measurements show that the optimal positions for lift enhancement appear at slightly spanwise overlapping between the leading and trailing wings.",54,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033900,"This paper describes a method for determining an optimal control allocation function for aircraft with an unconventional control surface setup (i.e., that does not consist of a conventional elevator, rudder, and ailerons). Atypical application of this control mixing would be to impart RLconventional handling qualities to an unconventional unmanned aerial vehicle, which will enable a pilot to fly the unmanned vehicle manually during flight testing. The mixing can also be used as a backup mode to recover the unmanned aerial vehicle manually, should any sensor failures occur during flight testing. Furthermore, the allocation can be used to simplify the inner control loops of an unmanned aerial vehicle autopilot or stability augmentation system. The control allocation design process was formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. A methodology was proposed to define the constraints, which can be customized for a particular aircraft or application.",54,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033949,"This paper presents a mesh generation strategy that facilitates the numerical simulation of ice accretion on realistic aircraft configurations by automating the deformation of surface and volume meshes in response to the evolving ice shape. The discrete surface evolution algorithm is based on a face-offsetting strategy that uses an eigenvalue decomposition to determine 1) the nodal offset direction and 2) a null space in which the quality of the surface mesh is improved via point redistribution. A fast algebraic technique is then used to propagate the computed surface deformations into the surrounding volume mesh. Due to inherent limitations in the icing model employed here, there is no intent to present a tool to predict three-dimensional ice accretions but, instead, to demonstrate a meshing strategy for surface evolution and mesh deformation that is appropriate for aircraft icing applications. In this context, sample results are presented for a complex glaze-ice accretion on a rectangular-planform wing with a constant GLC-305 airfoil section and rime-ice accretion on a swept, tapered wing (also with a GLC-305 cross section). This meshing strategy is demonstrated to be robust and largely automatic, except for severe deformations.",54,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033755,"An approach to modeling longitudinal airplane aerodynamics during unsteady maneuvers was developed for a micro air vehicle at angles of attack well past stall under unsteady conditions, including dynamic stall as might be experienced in perching maneuvers. To gather unsteady micro air vehicle flight data, an offboard motion tracking system was used to capture free-flight trajectories of a micro air vehicle with a weight of 14.44 g (0.0594 oz) and a wingspan of 37.47 cm (14.75 in.), operating at a nominal Reynolds number of 25,000. The measured trajectories included nominal gliding flight as well as mild-to-aggressive stalls. For the most aggressive stall case, the maximum lift coefficient reached a value near 2.5. The new model derived from the test data relied on a so-called separation parameter that modeled the aerodynamic lag during rapid changes in the angle of attack, and it thereby captured the effects of dynamic stall seen in the lift, drag, and moment coefficient data. Results from the model were shown for flights that covered a range of conditions from quasi-steady low angle-of-attack flight to aggressive stalls with angles of attack approaching 90 deg.",54,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033618,"This paper presents the modeling of the performance of small propellers used for vertical takeoff and landing micro aerial vehicles operating at low Reynolds numbers and in oblique flow. The blade element momentum theory, vortex lattice method, and momentum theory for oblique flow are used to predict propeller performance. For validation, the predictions for a commonly used propeller for vertical takeoff and landing micro aerial vehicles are compared to a set of wind-tunnel experiments. Both the blade element momentum theory and vortex lattice method succeed in predicting correct trends of the forces and moments acting upon the propeller shaft, although accuracy decreases significantly in oblique flow. For the dataset analyzed here, combining the available data of the propeller in purely axial flow with the momentum theory for oblique flow and applying a correction factor for the wake skew angle results in more accurate performance estimates at all elevation angles.",54,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033798,"High-fidelity aerodynamic shape optimization based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations is used to optimize the aerodynamic performance of a conventional tube-and-wing design, a hybrid wing-body, and a novel lifting-fuselage concept for regional-class aircraft. Trim-constrained drag minimization is performed on a hybrid wing-body design, with an optimized conventional design serving as a performance reference. The optimized regional-class hybrid wing-body yields no drag savings when compared with the conventional reference aircraft. Starting from the optimized hybrid wing-body, an exploratory optimization with significant geometric freedom is then performed, resulting in a novel shape with a slender lifting fuselage and distinct wings. Based on this exploratory result, a new regional-class lifting-fuselage configuration is designed and optimized. With a span constrained by code “C” gate limits and having the same wing-only span as the conventional reference aircraft, this new design produces up to 10% lower drag than the reference aircraft. The effect of structural weight uncertainties, cruise altitude, and stability requirements are also examined.",54,3

Analysis or design of such systems requires accurate prediction capability. To validate current Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation methodologies, an experiment was performed using a rotating pipe, and simulation results were compared to the measured data. A quasi-one-dimensional code was also compared to experiment as a lower-order simulation tool for faster solutions. The test and simulations include several combinations of steady inlet and exit conditions as well as an unsteady inlet valve operation at several rotational speeds. The quasi-one-dimensional code showed good correlation for steady inlet and exit conditions with boundary conditions obtained from experiment. Navier–Stokes methods also showed good agreement with measured data for pressure and mass flow rate at most conditions, while properly capturing complex flow features including separation, secondary swirl flow, and tip-flow interactions. The kinetic-eddy simulation and the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence models were tested to examine solution sensitivity under the complex flow environment. The two turbulence models showed similar results, except when the inlet valve was closed, in which case the kinetic-eddy simulation model showed better correlation.",54,3
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034050,"An uncertainty-based approach is undertaken to deal with multipoint wing aerostructural optimization. The flight points are determined by the quadruple set of parameters: Mach number, cruise altitude, carried payload, and flight range. From this set, the payload and range are modeled as probabilistically uncertain based on U.S. flight data for the operations of an A320 aircraft. The fuel burn is selected as the performance metric to optimize. Structural failure criteria, aileron efficiency, and field performance considerations are formulated as constraints. The wing is parametrized by its planform, airfoil sections, and structural thickness. The analyses disciplines consist of an aerostructural solver and a surrogate-based mission analysis. For the optimization task, a gradient-based algorithm is used in conjunction with coupled adjoint methods and a fuel burn sensitivity analytical formula. Another key enabler is a cost-effective nonintrusive uncertainty propagator that allows optimization of an aircraft with legacy analysis codes, within a computational budget.",54,3
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033914,"This paper presents an aerostructural perspective on the potential benefits of wingletted wings in comparison to planar wings of the same projected span. There is no consensus in the current literature on the efficiency gains possible from winglets. The present paper takes a step further toward understanding the tradeoffs in the design of wingletted wings using high-fidelity numerical optimization based on both purely aerodynamic and fully coupled aerostructural analysis. The high-fidelity analysis in both cases uses the Euler equations to model the flow along with a friction drag estimate based on the surface area. Three configurations are considered: winglet-up, winglet-down, and planar. The results show that downward winglets produce a greater drag reduction than upward winglets for two reasons. First, the downward winglet moves the tip vortex further away from the wing from a purely aerodynamic standpoint. Second, the winglet-down configuration has a higher projected span at the deflected state due to the structural deflections. This indicates that fully coupled high-fidelity aerostructural optimization is required to quantify the benefits of winglets properly. The winglet-down configuration can reduce the total drag by up to 2% at the same weight as the optimal planar counterpart.",54,3
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034080,"Lambda wing configurations are known to possess challenging flight characteristics at transonic Mach numbers. This study tests various methods for increasing the maneuverability and stability of the SACCON, a generic lambda wing configuration. Several control concepts are presented and tested to determine their effects on the lateral-directional and longitudinal stability of the aircraft. The first category of control concepts uses smooth surface deformations of the wing tips to eliminate control surface gaps found with traditional flap-based systems. The second category uses panel deflections on the upper surface of the aircraft. Each concept is simulated at Mach numbers in the range of using the TAU code of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), with subsequent wind tunnel tests taking place in the Transonic Wind Tunnel of the German–Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW-TWG) in Göttingen, Germany. The main flow features created by each control device and the Mach number effects are discussed, as are their effects on the aircraft’s aerodynamic performance. The smooth wing-tip deformations isolate the control derivatives and are best able to enhance lateral-directional stability. The upper surface devices create a more complicated response but offer more immediate application due to their reliance on firmly established technology.",54,3
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034051,"Experimental work has shown that the flowfield around a wing-body configuration can be successfully modified with a short Kutta edge tail, so named because, by controlling the rear stagnation point, the circulation about the body can be effectively modified. The precise nature of the Kutta edge and body interaction were not considered, rather only the global flowfield effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the lift potential of low-drag bodies with Kutta edges, by numerically solving the flowfield around two low-drag bodies selected from literature. The drag and lift of the bodies were compared with experimental and numerical results in literature with good agreement. The geometries, computational grids, and boundary conditions of the two benchmark cases were then modified by adding short Kutta edges, for aftbody deflection angles of 2, 4, 6, and 8 deg at Reynolds numbers of and . Both of the low-drag bodies showed similar average increases in lift and in pressure drag with the addition of the Kutta edge at increasing deflection angles.

23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033982,"Power-required flight testing has traditionally been done using the classic power independent of weight, velocity independent of weight method. This method is well suited for manned aircraft but has some shortcomings when applied to unmanned systems that are remotely piloted and/or operating on small test ranges. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used to identify the lift and drag models of two test aircraft using data acquired through acceleration and deceleration runs. The calculated power-required data were reduced using the classic technique to remove weight and air density effects. Flight-test data were collected using a Raspberry Pi single-board computer because of its low cost, weight, and good performance. Data points using the classic flight-test method were also collected for comparison against the dynamic method. Because of the small test range used, a third of all points collected using the classic method had to be eliminated because of assumption violations. The flight-test results show good agreement between the deceleration runs and the classic method. The acceleration runs generally had a poorer overall fit and a larger spread due to excessive sensor noise caused by imbalances in the motor/prop combination. Overall, the dynamic power analysis was much easier to perform and required significantly less time and airspace.",54,3

A conceptual design phase energy model for the cross section of a wing with an internal fuel tank is developed for computing the rate of heat rejection in flight. The calculations focus on physical dependencies rather than empirical correlations, solving the conservation of energy equation by using results from prior solved conservation of mass and momentum equations. A series of control volumes and various temperature profiles are employed to model the thermal boundary layer. The surface boundary conditions include an isothermal surface as well as an unheated starting length to approximate a heated fuel tank. An implicit root-finding method is verified and used in solving the resulting system of equations. Results are compared to empirical correlations for validation purposes involving laminar and turbulent flow test cases over a flat plate, various NACA airfoils, as well as a C-130 Hercules. Two temperature profiles are considered and compared throughout the verification and validation process.
