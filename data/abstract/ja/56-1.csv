By flying periodic trajectories within these gradients of horizontal winds, a dynamic soaring bird or glider uses the locally accelerating wind to its advantage, extracting sufficient energy from the environment during each trajectory cycle to overcome losses due to induced and parasitic drag. The dynamic soaring literature currently offers two competing definitions of aircraft kinetic energy, pointing to opposing views regarding the source of dynamic soaring energy exchange between the wind and the aircraft. A series of heuristics is developed to logically establish the wind-fixed/wind-aligned reference frame (that is, airspeed) as the appropriate choice for scalar kinetic energy computation while not imposing any such limitation on the usage of arbitrary reference frames for dynamic soaring equations of motion. Furthermore, while acknowledging that other kinetic energy reference frames are valid from the standpoint of physics, only wind-fixed frame kinetic energy tracks useful energy transfer from the vertical gradient of horizontal winds, with no attribution of kinetic energy from downwind turns.",56,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034789,"The paper presents a methodology for reduced-order modeling of aeroelastic systems identification and flutter prediction. The aeroelastic system is modeled as a multioutput autoregressive process, and the model parameters are identified based on aeroelastic responses simulated in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The aeroelastic system is identified at a few subcritical (preflutter) dynamic pressure values. Flutter onset is determined from a stability parameter that is computed for the two dominant aeroelastic modes. The methodology is demonstrated on three test cases: a linear two-dimensional airfoil, transonic two-dimensional wing with reference to a wind-tunnel test, and a generic transport aircraft model. The paper compares the multioutput autoregressive to the single-output autoregressive model and shows that the former is more straightforward to implement, is robust, and requires shorter identification data. Overall, the methodology is simple to implement because it only requires an aeroelastic simulation capability and basic processing. It is computationally efficient and is therefore suitable for CFD-based flutter prediction. Other than predicting the flutter onset dynamic pressure, the method can be used to determine whether the aeroelastic system is stable at a specific dynamic pressure value without resorting to a lengthy CFD aeroelastic simulation.",56,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034751,"This paper discusses the development of a software suite that aims to optimize helicopter trajectories with respect to the noise impact on the ground. The software suite has been developed around an advanced gradient-based optimization algorithm based on optimal control theory. The helicopter trajectories are modeled using an eight-degree-of-freedom flight mechanics model. To determine the noise impact on the ground, a helicopter noise model developed in this work consists of three modules, namely, a helicopter source noise model, a propagation model, and a noise impact model. To determine the noise levels on the ground, the source noise levels are determined from a database of aeroacoustically determined noise levels for varying flight conditions and projected on a hemisphere centered at the main rotor hub. The noise propagation model included in the suite is capable of determining the propagation loss between the source and the receiver in nonstandard atmospheric conditions, and it yields the total noise level in individual receiver locations. Finally, these noise levels can be quantified into a single noise impact criterion, which can be used as an optimization criterion in the optimal control formulation. To exemplify the capabilities of the suite, a hypothetical city center approach procedure is optimized for the noise impact in communities surrounding the helispot.",56,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034932,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate the noise generation of a low-boom aircraft design in flight trim conditions under uncertainty. The deflection of control surfaces to maintain a trimmed flight state has the potential to change the perceived loudness at the ground. Furthermore, the uncertainties associated with the control surface deflections can complicate the overall uncertainty quantification. Incorporation of the uncertainties in the prediction of perceived sound levels during the design phase can lead to improved robustness. In this paper, a brief review of low-boom flight trim research is presented. Realistic flight trim conditions requiring control surface deflection are integrated into the current research efforts for uncertainty quantification and vehicle design. In addition, a generalized set of procedures for the characterization of uncertainties in flight trim conditions are introduced. In a case study of the application of these procedures, a 5 dB average difference in the perceived level of loudness was found between clean (no deflections) and trimmed configurations. Also, uncertainties attributable to control surface deflection were found to account for, on average, over 50% of the total near-field uncertainty. Uncertainty discretization methods implemented were able to give more insight into the overall global variances.",56,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034931,"The dynamics and stability of variable-length vertically traveling, heavy cables with an end load are investigated. Such cables act as tethers in aerostat systems. The cable is modeled as a heavy string undergoing small, planar vibrations while attached to a rigid, spherical aerostat. Aerodynamic and buoyancy forces act only on the aerostat. An asymptotic analysis for slow deployment rates provides excellent leading-order approximation to the dynamics, which is also obtained from finite element simulations. Stability of the aerostat system is then investigated computationally by considering the linear stability of the system when it is perturbed from its nominal dynamical state at any given time. It is found that, when an aerostat ascends, the cable always goes unstable after a certain time through a divergence instability. In contrast, flutter instability is found in the cable during the aerostat’s descent. These stability analyses help in the development of deployment charts that relate the maximum achievable elevation to deployment rate. Such deployment charts can help in parameter selection for efficient aerostat deployment. The dynamics of the aerostat in the presence of spatiotemporally varying aerodynamic forces are also studied computationally. The paper concludes with two case studies of aerostat deployment that demonstrate the utility of the current analysis.",56,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034891,"Spoilers of large commercial aircraft are often realized in composite sandwich design. Over the past few years, many studies have been focused on finding highly integrated composite structures that can replace such sandwich designs. The motivation is given mainly because of commercial aspects, which from a structural point of view are difficult to justify. Sandwich structures have the intrinsic property of high bending stiffness and are therefore perfectly suitable for the plate-like design of an aircraft spoiler. However, monolithic structures can be produced with a lower cost, and their subcomponents can be easily integrated in a single part. Two monolithic alternatives, which meet all structural requirements, are considered with respect to applied materials, manufacturing processes, and manufacturing costs. The established designs are compared with a standard sandwich spoiler, and thus a holistic view is provided on the selection of designs, processes, and materials for future aircraft spoilers.",56,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034986,"Separated flowfields around two iced airfoils with horn features near stall are numerically studied using wall-modeled large-eddy simulation. The iced airfoils are the GLC305 airfoil with rime ice 212 and the NLF0414 airfoil with glaze ice 623. A grid-quality-based hybrid central/upwind scheme is applied for numerical flux computation. The close agreement between the computed lift, drag, and surface pressure distribution and the experimental results illustrates the capability of the present method. In particular, the current method can accurately predict the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of a free shear layer. The statistical results, instantaneous flowfields, pressure fluctuations, and characteristic frequencies are investigated. Both flowfields are dominated by separation bubbles. The bubble length increases with the angle of attack according to a quadratic relation. A strong-fluctuation region in the flowfield grows rapidly at high angles of attack, especially near stall. High- and low-frequency peaks are found in the initial and further downstream regions of the free shear layer, respectively. The high frequency is caused by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability and vortex shedding. The low frequency might be caused by the vortex merging in the further downstream region of the free shear layer.",56,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035113,"The high-speed aeroacoustic wind tunnel at Carleton University is a new facility commissioned with the purpose of facilitating experimental studies of turbulent boundary-layer (TBL)-induced surface pressure fluctuations. This research is primarily intended for applications related to aircraft cabin noise generation from structures exposed to high-speed flow. This open-jet blowdown wind tunnel is a unique facility in Canada and one of a few aeroacoustic wind tunnels in the world capable of achieving speeds up to Mach 0.8. Flow is delivered from a nozzle with dimensions of 6.1 by 15 cm to a test section enclosed within an anechoic chamber with internal dimensions of 1.9 by 0.88 by 1.95 m. This study details the complete design methodology for all major wind-tunnel components, including the numerical simulations performed in the validation of the designed components. The results of the test section background noise levels and TBL surface pressure fluctuation spectral behavior developed over a flat test section plate are compared with established data and empirical models available in the literature.",56,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034897,"Preliminary aircraft design necessitates the use of a range of analysis tools, which are often scattered among many departments in an organization and require regular tuning from skilled operators. For this reason, a distributed Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation approach that permits individual organizational domains to use their preferred analysis and optimization tools would be most suitable. This paper revisits a Blackboard framework, which uses simple heuristics to automatically guide organizational design domains to a single optimum by narrowing the bounds on the shared design variables. The authors present a newly developed rule base for this legacy framework, which has been given the title “Multidisciplinary Pattern Search.” Two examples, one of which is for conceptual transonic wing design, demonstrate the merit of the newly developed rule base, database, and visualization modules. They also serve as a means for comparisons with two established Multidisciplinary Design Optimisation architectures. The results indicate that the Blackboard performs better than the distributed Collaborative Optimisation approach, albeit worse than the monolithic simultaneous analysis and design method that tends to be organizationally disruptive to implement.",56,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034987,"The certification of modern commercial aircraft requires manufacturers to demonstrate flight safety under various scenarios, including icing conditions. Although computational tools play a key role in icing-related aircraft design and certification, icing wind-tunnel testing remains an important part of the process. The size of models that can be tested is limited by the dimensions of the existing icing wind-tunnel facilities. To obtain ice accretions on full-scale aircraft wings in icing wind tunnels, scaling methods must be applied. One attractive option is the use of hybrid airfoils. Hybrid airfoils present the same leading-edge geometry of the full-scale airfoil but replace the aft section with a redesigned geometry of reduced chord. When properly designed, these models generate the full-scale ice accretion on the leading edge, with reduced blockage and aerodynamic loads. This paper presents an investigation of the effects of different design parameters on the performance of hybrid airfoils, identifies the key design parameters to generate full-scale ice shapes, and puts the research findings in perspective with overall model design tradeoffs.",56,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034720,"A higher-order free-wake (HOFW) method has been developed to enable conceptual design-space explorations of propeller–wing systems. The method uses higher-order vorticity elements to represent the wings and propeller blades as lifting surfaces. The higher-order elements allow for improved force resolution and more intrinsically computationally stable wakes than a comparable vortex-lattice method, while retaining the relative ease of geometric representation inherent to such methods. The propeller and wing surfaces and wakes are modeled within the same flowfield, thus accounting for mutual interaction without the need for empirical models. Time-averaged results found using the HOFW method are compared with experimental propeller, proprotor, and propeller–wing system data, along with two semi-empirical methods. The results show that the method is well suited for performance prediction of lightly loaded propellers/proprotors and propeller–wing systems and can successfully predict design trends. In addition, the time required to define a geometry and solve for the flowfield with the HOFW method as compared to that required with a computational fluid dynamics method make it particularly useful for design-space exploration. These strengths were highlighted through a sample design study on a generic distributed propulsion vehicle.",56,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034748,"The aeromechanics of a model-scale, lift-offset rotor system designed for high-advance-ratio forward flight were investigated by means of a numerical comprehensive analysis as well as hover and wind-tunnel testing. The 2-m-diam rotor system was tested in single-rotor as well as in coaxial counter-rotating rotor configuration. The focus was on the development of the computational model and its validation for advance ratios of up to 0.5, at lift offsets up to 20%. Blade structural characteristics were modeled according to the measured elastic properties, and reduced-order aerodynamics modeling using a free-vortex wake method was used to ensure computational efficiency. Numerical predictions of coaxial rotor performance, cyclic controls, steady hub forces, and blade clearance at multiple advance ratios and varying lift offsets in general correlated well with the measurements and particularly well for medium to high advance ratios . Discrepancies at high lift offsets may be related to an underprediction of the cyclic controls. Vibratory hub loads correlated well with the measurements in both trends and magnitudes for the single rotors. For the coaxial configuration, good agreement was found in the vibratory thrust and drag, whereas the side forces captured the trends but underpredicted the magnitudes seen in the experiments, which included significant higher-frequency content.",56,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034873,"In this paper, first a methodology to find a loading solution (of point control force) that results in noise reduction at a single observer is developed. A governing equation is established and the loading solution is obtained by solving the equation numerically. Here, the loading solution is the component of loading vector in radiation direction. The loading solution can provide complete noise cancellation at the target observer. Additionally, two methodologies to find a loading solution that results in noise reduction over a broad area are developed, which are combination methodology and prescribed formula methodology. Both chordwise and spanwise control forces are considered. The chordwise force solutions can provide over 6 dB reduction over a 60 deg azimuth range and a 100 deg elevation range. The spanwise force can provide over 6 dB reduction over a 100 deg azimuth range and a 60 deg elevation range. However, noise at some observers outside the target area is increased. Finally, two active devices are proposed. An active flap is studied to generate chordwise force, while a rotating winglet is studied to generate spanwise force to reduce noise.",56,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034896,"This Paper introduces an extension of so-called multipole analysis, which reduces the computational cost associated with predicting a supersonic vehicle’s sonic boom signature on the ground. Multipole analysis enables the modification of the near-field waveform of a supersonic flight vehicle to account for the effect of coalescence in the circumferential direction, even in the same position as the extracted waveform, which results in a large reduction of the computational region of the computational fluid dynamics analysis in the vehicle’s vicinity. However, multipole analysis cannot consider a flowfield with lateral asymmetry, which often occurs when dealing with practical vehicle configurations or real flight conditions. The authors have implemented a multipole analysis tool named MPnoise and extended the tool to laterally asymmetric flowfields. It is shown in this Paper that such an extension is easily accomplished by introducing sinusoidal terms into the original, laterally symmetric formulation of multipole analysis. Also shown is a successful convergence between waveforms computed with and without multipole analysis, even when the flowfield has a slight asymmetry in the lateral direction.",56,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034936,"Aircraft spin susceptibility is a critical parameter for the flight safety. Recently developed quantitative methods for analysis of nonlinear systems are applied to analysis of aircraft spins. The parameters of aircraft spin modes are calculated using numerical continuation on a parameter. Polynomial approximations of the reduced fifth-order system with account of significant nonlinearities in the aircraft aerodynamic coefficients are derived near a number of stable spin equilibrium points and validated by simulation. For the calculated polynomial approximations, low bounds of ellipsoidal approximations of regions of attraction are estimated using the Lyapunov-based optimization technique. The estimated sizes of regions of attraction for different spin modes can be used as a measure of aircraft susceptibility to spin and relative danger of particular spins.",56,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034934,"The strut-braced wing aircraft configuration promises to reduce fuel burn by enabling higher spans that reduce lift-induced drag. A successful design for this configuration depends on a careful trade-off between the various sources of drag and structural weight. When using computational fluid dynamic tools for aerodynamic shape optimization, generating high-quality structured meshes for the strut-braced wing configuration becomes challenging, especially near junctions. Furthermore, mesh deformation procedures frequently generate negative volume cells when applied to these structured meshes during optimization. This paper addresses this issue by using overset meshes and a component-based parametrization technique to achieve a flexible design optimization cycle capable of handling changing junctions. This study uses this approach to minimize drag of the PADRI 2017 strut-braced wing benchmark for a fixed lift constraint at transonic flight conditions. The drag of the optimized configuration is 15% lower than the baseline due to the reduction of shocks and separation in the wing-strut junction region. This result represents an example in which high-fidelity modeling is required to quantify the benefits of a new aircraft configuration and address potential issues during the conceptual design.",56,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035045,"The recently developed numerical parametric flutter margin method is applied to perform safe flutter tests in which the flutter-onset conditions of a nominal configuration are positively identified, while the system is stabilized by an added concentrated mass. A known excitation force is applied to the added mass, and the collocated normal acceleration response is measured. Fourier transforms of the two signals are used for calculating flutter margins that change sign at flutter-onset conditions of the nominal system. The stability of the modified model at these conditions facilitates safe, flutter-free, testing conditions with a robustly measured response. The method is applied in wind-tunnel flutter tests of a clamped wing with a tip store, to which a stabilizing mass is added at a forward location. The added mass is connected through a thin cord and a pulley to a weight outside the tunnel. The excitation is performed by cutting the cord, and the mass acceleration is extrapolated from other accelerometers on the wing. The process is repeated at several airspeeds to compute frequency response functions and pinpoint the flutter-onset velocity of the nominal system. The resulting flutter boundaries are within a few percent of those measured by direct-flutter tests.",56,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034994,"Wind tunnel experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of vortex generators on a transonic corner flow separation, resulting from the interaction of a normal shock wave with a turbulent boundary layer in a duct at . The shape of the vortex generators was rectangular. The vortex generators were mounted on the bottom wall of the test section. The investigation studied the effects of the rotation direction of the vortex, the vortex generator size and position relative to the shock, and the walls. When the leading edge of the vortex generators turned toward the corner, the effect of the vortex generators on the corner flow separation monotonically decreased as the vortex generators size reduced. In these cases, it was observed that independent separations appeared on the bottom wall. When the leading edge of the vortex generators pointed in the opposite direction away from the corner, the flow structure was found to depend on the size and the location of the vortex generators. The flow structures were categorized into three modes. The effect of the vortex generators and the three modes were successfully collapsed with a location parameter normalized by the second power of the nondimensional size.",56,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034595,"It is common for new aircraft configuration proposals to include some kind of lifting body. The reduction in fuselage–wing interference drag, in principle, improves span efficiency and hence allows for reduction in total span and structural weight. One such proposal involves controlling body circulation by a central trailing-edge flap, and though the basic idea has been supported in initial wind tunnel tests, there have been no further attempts to systematically explore the design space for these wing–body–tail geometries. The first purpose of this study was to numerically simulate the experimental work. Simulations with incompressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations show quite significant separation over the aftbody, limiting the effectiveness of the trailing edge. The second purpose of the paper was to investigate the characteristics when two low-drag bodies from literature were used in otherwise similar wing–body–tail configurations. The wing–body–tail assemblages had different aftbody separation characteristics. Adding the trailing edge increased the total drag coefficient, and the expected improvement of induced drag did not lead to a net benefit. It is concluded that, if such a favourable geometry exists, then it has not been found here.",56,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034667,"Air transport planning takes new technologies, strategies, and procedures into consideration when optimizing both trajectory and air traffic management. Continuous Climb operations (CCO) are new optimal departing trajectories that minimize fuel consumption, emissions, and noise levels within the vicinity of airports. In contrast with previous research, this paper does not focus on the optimization techniques of these procedures but on the estimation of novel separation minima. First, the authors present the CCO model: climbing structure, operational concept, and simulations. Second, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to obtain a large, statistically significant sample. The uncertainty of CCO trajectories is modeled taking several factors into account, such as aircraft type, mass, speed, positioning error, temperature, and wind. Mass is the factor that adds most uncertainty to climbing trajectories. Afterward, the authors develop a conflict-resolution algorithm to perform systematic analysis of separation minima. This algorithm has two goals: 1) to ensure that separation minima between aircraft pairs performing CCO are not violated throughout the departure, and 2) to dynamically calculate the on-ground separation between CCO. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that an attempt has been made to quantify CCO separation minima. The results of the simulation confirm that the new CCO separation minima are larger than standard separation minima.",56,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034882,"The goal of the present work is to develop a high-fidelity nonlinear finite element (FE) model able to describe the mechanical response of an aircraft structure composed of a pylon, sway braces, and a store system with an applied external load. Unstable phenomena (such as limit cycle oscillations) on aircraft pylons have been shown to occur because of the presence of nonlinearities (structural and aerodynamic). Most previous investigations mainly focused on aerodynamic effects while almost neglecting structural effects. The present paper, however, focuses on the building and assessment of a nonlinear FE structural model of a pylon, starting from experimental evidence, showing that nonlinearities are concentrated in the joint between the pylon and the suspended store. The static results of the numerical model were assessed by means of an experimental stiffness test. The dynamical reliability of the model was assessed when linked to a delta cropped wing comparing its vibration modes with experimental values and with a linear model. The results demonstrate that the FE model is able to accurately replicate both the static and dynamic behavior of the system.",56,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034849,"Accurate predictions of aircraft noise levels are desirable to enforce noise control regulations around airports and to evaluate noise abatement procedures. The current best practice noise contour prediction models assume certain default net thrust values depending on the engine type and aircraft altitude. This Paper proposes a method for calculating the engine fan settings (and, hence, the net thrust) directly from audio recordings. This method was tested with a large number of Airbus A330–300 and Boeing 777–200 flyover audio recordings. A significant correlation was found between the recorded noise levels and , explaining up to 45% of the variability in the noise levels. Using the calculated values in the noise prediction models, instead of the default values, increases the agreement with the actual recorded noise levels and explains parts of the variability. The inclusion of accurate values of and the update of the aircraft noise prediction calculations is therefore highly encouraged, for example, by increasing the dependency on of the noise levels.",56,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034978,"Wingtip-mounted propellers installed in a tractor configuration can decrease the wing induced drag by attenuating the wingtip vortex by the propeller slipstream. This paper presents an aerodynamic analysis of the propeller–wing interaction effects for the wingtip-mounted propeller configuration, including a comparison with a conventional configuration with the propeller mounted on the inboard part of the wing. Measurements were taken in a low-speed wind tunnel at Delft University of Technology, with two wing models and a low-speed propeller. Particle-image-velocimetry measurements downstream of a symmetric wing with integrated flap highlighted the swirl reductions characteristic of the wingtip-mounted propeller due to wingtip-vortex attenuation and swirl recovery. External-balance and surface-pressure measurements confirmed that this led to an induced-drag reduction with inboard-up propeller rotation. In a direct comparison with a conventional propeller–wing layout, the wingtip-mounted configuration showed a drag reduction of around 15% at a lift coefficient of 0.5 and a thrust coefficient of 0.12. This aerodynamic benefit increased upon increasing the wing lift coefficient and propeller thrust setting. An analysis of the wing performance showed that the aerodynamic benefit of the wingtip-mounted propeller was due to an increase of the wing’s effective span-efficiency parameter.",56,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C033911,"In this study, the effects of the flight-path angle (FPA) ranging between 1.0 and 4.5 deg during a continuous descent approach, on certain fuel-related parameters such as fuel flow, fuel burn per 1000 ft of altitude, and specific range, are investigated. The dataset, obtained from Turkish Airlines, includes 4384 eligible flight data records of narrow-bodied commercial aircraft performing 9351 domestic flights between 30 city pairs, across Turkey. The results indicate that the fuel flow is a strong linear function of FPA up to 2.5–3.0 deg for all of the aircraft types, whereas the effect diminishes above 3.0 deg. There is a monotonic decrease of the fuel burn per 1000 ft of altitude with an increase in the FPA, with the trend being stronger than that for fuel flow. Even though the fuel consumption of the descent flight significantly decreases with steeper FPAs, the effect of the FPA on the total fuel consumption of the flight seems not as straightforward as it does when considering only the descent phase. A case study based on this model indicates a U-shaped pattern for total fuel burn with an increase in the FPA, in which the highest fuel saving relative to 1.0 deg of the FPA is calculated to be 14.0% (191 kg) at 2.5 deg of the FPA.",56,1
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034219,"Real-time estimation of dynamic model parameters for an unmanned aircraft can provide valuable information about the dynamics of the vehicle. However, the aircraft model estimation performance can be severely degraded with an active control system and highly collinear model terms such as those found on a quadrotor unmanned aircraft. Model parameters were estimated based on dynamic flight data of a quadcopter aircraft. System identification maneuvers were generated using varying-amplitude orthogonal multisine input signals applied on a quadcopter with nominal hardware conditions and with a damaged propeller. Recursive Fourier transform regression was applied to dynamic data to estimate parameters of two input model forms: independent and delta input. Prediction capability of the identified models was assessed using data of nearly the same flight conditions. Results indicated that, as the amplitude of the input multisine increased, the identifiability of control effectiveness improved, and prediction error decreased. Overall, a well-designed multi-input multisine input design and Fourier transform regression applied together provided efficient and accurate real-time parameter estimation that effectively overcame challenges imposed by a system subjected to closed-loop control with collinear model terms.",56,1

The method is an extension of standard dynamic mode decomposition, which is a method typically used to extract flow patterns and frequencies from unsteady fluid dynamics measurements or numerical simulations. In the fluid dynamic field, HODMD has proven to be a very efficient, robust, and accurate method to extract modes, frequencies, and damping from very noisy and large signals, with reduced manual interaction. In a similar way, this paper shows the good performance of this method when it is applied to the noisy data of this complex experiment. This fact sheds light on the new possibilities for the aerospace industry to incorporate HODMD to perform robust analyses.",56,1
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C035022,"This paper outlines the development of a parallel three-dimensional hybrid finite volume finite difference capability. The specific application area under consideration is modeling the trailing vortices shed from the wings of aircraft under transonic flight conditions. For this purpose, the Elemental finite volume code is employed in the vicinity of the aircraft, whereas the ESSENSE finite difference software is employed to accurately resolve the trailing vortices. The former method is spatially formally second-order, and the latter is set to sixth-order accuracy. The coupling of the two methods is achieved in a stable manner through the use of summation-by-parts operators and weak imposition of boundary conditions using simultaneous approximation terms. The developed hybrid solver is successfully validated against an analytical test case. This is followed by demonstrating the ability to model the flowfield, including trailing vortex structures, around the NASA Common Research Model under transonic flow conditions. The interface treatment is shown to describe the intersecting vortices in a smooth manner. In addition, insights gained in resolving the vortices include violation of underlying assumptions of analytical vortex modeling methods.",56,1

This study encompasses a multidimensional design optimization approach wherein the wing geometries are optimized with respect to both span load and spanwise camber to achieve minimum aerodynamic drag. A discrete vortex element method was coupled with a constrained gradient-based optimization routine to achieve these drag-optimal design configurations. Optimum drag configurations were obtained at a fixed design lift coefficient as well as a fixed bending moment constraint. Navier–Stokes simulations were also performed, which revealed an gain of 29.01 and 25.35% at design conditions, relative to an elliptically loaded planar wing for the upward and downward cant configurations, respectively. Different wake trace characteristics for the two hyperelliptic cambered span configurations were observed along with surface flow features indicating different wake vortex and boundary-layer transition behaviors for the two hyperelliptic cambered span configurations.",56,1
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C034967,"Nonmorphing, conventional aircraft wings are designed for a compromise of good performance at a variety of flight conditions. Accordingly, such wings perform suboptimally when considered at a single flight condition. Morphing trailing-edge devices offer an opportunity to change this wing design paradigm by allowing wings to adapt to varying flight conditions. This adaptability weakens the correlation between performance at various flight conditions and increases the robustness of the wing’s performance, providing closer-to-optimal performance at each flight condition. To study the isolated aerodynamic effects of this increased robustness, we perform a number of aerodynamic and aerostructural shape optimizations of a morphing trailing-edge device that can change the shape of the rear 10% of the wing at a variety of flight conditions on the Common Research Model aircraft configuration. The aerodynamically optimized morphing configuration yields a 1.0% fuel burn reduction for a long-range mission. When performing aerostructural optimization, which considers structural deformations and structural weight reductions enabled by active load alleviation, the fuel burn reduction is 2.7%.",56,1
