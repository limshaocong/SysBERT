5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031249,"This paper describes an experimental investigation into the use of trailing-edge-mounted plasma actuators for lift enhancement at low Reynolds numbers. The measurements were performed using a 0.2 m chord NACA 0009 airfoil with a plasma actuator mounted at , and over the Reynolds-number range . Force-balance data are presented that show that the effect of the actuator varies significantly with wind speed and angle of attack, and that, at some test conditions, the actuator produces a reduction in the airfoil lift. Detailed surface-pressure and Laser-Doppler-Velocimetry measurements show that the precise actuator effect depends upon how the actuator flowfield interacts with the trailing-edge boundary layer at the particular conditions of the test, and that the observed variation in actuator effect is a consequence of the different trailing-edge boundary-layer flows that can occur at low Reynolds numbers.",50,1

One such measure was the development of a standard for the development, documentation, and operation of models and simulations. The resulting standard attempts to develop a general framework for communicating information to decision makers by including programmatic, documentation, and reporting requirements. It also includes a scale intended to measure the credibility associated with model and simulation results. This report describes the philosophy and requirements overview of the resulting NASA Standard for Models and Simulations.",50,1

With existing and redesigned aircraft the fuel-saving potential is in the order of 7 to 15.5%, respectively. A global analysis of all Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 flights served in 2007 is performed, defining fuel-optimum intermediate airports wherever possible. An A330-200 type of aircraft with a design range reduced to 3000 n miles would yield highest global fuel benefits of 10.4% considering both intermediate stop operations flights and flights served in conventional ways. With today’s fleet, only few, very long routes could be served in a more fuel-efficient way than in standard operations. An airport load analysis shows that the top ten selected airports for intermediate stops would serve 30–44% of all flights for the fleets under consideration. These airports would experience additional traffic of roughly 130 flights per day. It is further shown that a cost-benefit analysis is necessary to reveal the true economic benefit of this concept for an airline, going beyond plain fuel cost to a trade-off between opposing cost elements, revenues, maintenance, and utilization.",50,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031450,"Aircraft instrument navigation is based on radio signal technology provided by ground navigation aids (navaids). The International Civil Aviation Organization specifies the required navaids availability, quality, accuracy, and integrity for ground installations on service, including the flight inspection operations. Flight inspection is the task of validating the radio signal emitted by navaids. This paper presents the architecture of a novel system for flight inspection based on the use of unmanned aircraft. The proposed architecture is operated remotely and has flight inspection capabilities by using radio signal sensors. It also has a precise positioning system, based on global navigation satellite system, and uses a data link with low bandwidth, long range, and redundancy. Except for congested airports, the flight inspection is done in segregated airspace. These segregated airspace inspection flights could be a catapult for seriously considering unmanned aircraft benefits in civil services. Unmanned aircraft are a ready technology waiting for legal approval to operate cooperatively with manned aircraft in regular airspace. The paper presents a simulation of the flight inspection of a navaid in Huesca, Spain. The simulation is a proof of concept of the proposed architecture.",50,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031618,"A half model of a scaled-down aircraft is designed and tested in the wind tunnel to validate the mathematical model of uncertainty for unsteady pressure coefficients in the frequency domain. In the wind-tunnel test a step-swept test was conducted to obtain the frequency response function. Then a time-domain response test was performed with turbulence excitation to identify the aircraft’s on-line poles. Based on the tested frequency response function for the on-line poles the structured singular value method was applied to determine the aerodynamic uncertainty level. Finally, the widely used analysis method was employed to compute the worst-case flutter boundary, and the result was compared with the experimental flutter velocity. The experimental flutter velocity is in the range of the predicted robust flutter boundary in which parameter uncertainties were taken into account in the numerical model. Experimental results validate that the uncertainty quantification theoretical frameworks incorporating experimental data can estimate the proper aerodynamic uncertainty level and predict a safe flutter boundary. The present results suggest that the time-response validation theoretical framework is more advantageous in robust stability analysis than the one based upon the frequency response function.",50,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031659,"This contribution discusses the implementation of active flow-separation control for a three-dimensional high-lift wing-body configuration under atmospheric low-speed wind-tunnel conditions. The slot actuators are applied on the suction side of the trailing-edge flap to prevent local flow separation. The experimental results indicate that the pulsed blowing flow control technique is effective on the present configuration with a global performance enhancement. Numerical investigations are the focus of this article. The baseline case is characterized by substantial portions of separated flow. Thus, the influence of grid resolution and turbulence modeling is investigated. Based on this an intermediate mesh in combination with the Shear Stress Transport model gives the best compromise between quality and computational turnaround times. The steady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) calculations carried out with constant blowing demonstrate the feasibility to simulate active flow control concepts. The key flow control method is the pulsed blowing. The verification of the unsteady RANS approach with active flow control shows that high computational resources are required for consistent numerical evaluations. The computational results highlight the ability of pulsed blowing at moderate blowing momentum coefficients to suppress the flow separation on the trailing-edge flap. The numerical results show an acceptable agreement with the experiments.",50,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031668,"This paper demonstrates the use of nonlinear normal modes to predict limit cycle oscillation in a pitch-plunge airfoil with cubically nonlinear pitch stiffness. Aeroelastic systems with quasi-steady and unsteady aerodynamics are analyzed with nonlinear normal modes. An alternative derivation of nonlinear normal modes using first-order form is offered for systems that cannot fit the standard second-order form. The effect of the master coordinate chosen to construct the nonlinear normal modes is examined and found to have a significant impact on the accuracy of the results. Based on the results herein the nonlinear normal mode method is found to be a viable approach to studying and predicting limit cycle oscillation in aeroelastic systems. Furthermore, a master coordinate based on the the linear flutter mode was found to lead to the best results.",50,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031715,"In the 1970s the B-747-100 alleviation tests, sponsored by NASA with FAA participation, provided unique continuous-wave lidar data, in which the vortex cores could be measured because they were marked with smoke. Measurements for both normal and alleviated wakes showed that the vortex core is persistent whereas the outer circulation of the vortex decays. This form of decay is exactly the opposite of what is observed at low Reynolds number for small aircraft or in wind tunnels. The stability of the core is consistent with the essentially laminar core observed via flow visualization. The circulation profile for the normal wake is well fitted by the Burnham-Hallock model both after initial rollup and after significant decay of the total circulation. The core size for the normal B-747-100 wake is larger (5% of wingspan) than typically observed for aircraft with zero or two wing-mounted engines. The observed wake decay means that the total vortex circulation is approximately equal to the popular vortex strength parameter: average circulation over vortex radii from 5 to 15 m.",50,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031761,"Numerical simulations were carried out for investigating the lateral aerodynamic characteristics of an air-to-air missile using an in-house-developed Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes code, CERANS. The analyses were carried out for Mach numbers from 0.8 to 2.0 and angles of attack ranging from 10 to 20 deg for roll sweeps from to . The rolling-moment behavior of the missile at Mach 1.2 and an angle of attack of 15 deg was explicitly and exhaustively analyzed because this flight condition is critical from the point of view of severe induced roll. The necessity of studying the rolling-moment behavior at finer roll orientations is demonstrated. The main objectives of the investigations are to explain the governing physical phenomenon and the resultant complex flow behavior that caused excessive induced roll generated during the critical flight condition.",50,1

Because of the interactions between the induced magnetic field and the structural deformation, it is necessary to couple these parts. This paper presents a three-dimensional simulation as well as experiments of flat plates made of aluminum or carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics. The simulation is characterized by electrical and structural finite element calculations, which are coupled in each time step. The current propagation is based on real tests that are executed at a special test rig. A coil, which is connected to an impulse generator, is used to induce magnetic forces. Flat plates of aluminum or carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics (with an additional aluminum doubler) were tested and deformation results were used to validate numerical simulations.",50,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031787,"There is an increasing need of infrared signature knowledge of aerospace vehicles, both for defense and civilian applications, such as stealth technology, sensor design, and aerial obstacle detection for unmanned aerial vehicles. Models have been developed for this purpose by manufacturers or research laboratories, in order to predict infrared signatures of targets in the specific fields investigated. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to model complex radiative phenomena, such as diffuse reflections between different parts of the airframe, to improve the infrared target signature accuracy, or to help experimental image interpretation. An aircraft infrared signature modeling code, developed at ONERA, has been upgraded with a global illumination model, based on a Monte Carlo ray tracer, in order to evaluate the influence of these effects. First, this paper presents the main characteristics of the code and the principles of the rendering method. Next, comparisons are accomplished with another simulation tool and experimental data as well. The benefit of this approach in aircraft infrared signature computation is then discussed.",50,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031825,"Presented is a design framework intended to support the introduction of changes resulting from unplanned iterations and affecting conceptual design. A novel methodology for an efficient exploration of the design space is proposed, which enables, in particular, the investigation of candidate alternatives for accommodating the required changes. The approach taken is to reuse the design information available from prior evaluations to generate surrogate models. These provide a means to obtain a prediction and the corresponding error estimate of the objectives and constraints functions at any point of interest across the design space. A reformulation of the problem is subsequently performed via the goal-attainment method, conducting an a priori articulation of preferences with respect to the achievement of desirable values of the design parameters. Ultimately, the exploration of optimal solutions is driven by a proposed extension of the sampling criteria associated with Bayesian global optimization, which enables the computation of points located in the vicinity of constraint boundaries. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by an analytical example, whereas its functionality and applicability to problems of industrial relevance are validated by a test case concerning aircraft conceptual design.",50,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031832,"In this study the structural deployment dynamics of a rollable micro air vehicle wing are investigated. The wing is composed of a single layer of woven, carbon-fiber composite and behaves like a tape-spring, remaining stiff in one direction (lift) while rolling easily in the other for storage. A finite element model is developed and evaluated for its comparison to an experimental model. A vacuum chamber is used to eliminate fluid effects on the structural deployment dynamics, which are recorded using a high-speed video camera. Modal testing and finite element updating are used to estimate unknown composite material properties for the analysis. A laser vibrometer is used to record wing mode shapes, and they are found to agree well with fitted mode shapes and their frequencies from the updated Abaqus finite element model. A wing deployment is simulated in Abaqus and compared with experimental deployments, and the time history displacements matched well. The deployment is found to be sensitive to the wing mount as well as to material properties, particularly damping.",50,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031837,"Effects of trailing-edge flap gaps on rotor performance are investigated using a high-fidelity coupled computational fluid dynamics computational structural dynamics analysis. Both integral flap (the flap is an integral part of the blade such that there are no physical gaps at the flap ends) and discrete flap (the flap is a separate entity with physical gaps in the span and chord directions) are examined on an UH-60A rotor at high-speed forward-flight conditions. A novel grid deformation scheme based on the Delaunay graph mapping is developed and implemented to allow the computational fluid dynamics modeling of the gaps with minimal distortion of mesh around the flap gap regions. This method offers an alternative to the traditional approach of modeling such configurations using overset meshes. The simulation results show that the effectiveness of the flap is minimally affected with span gaps; the penalty on rotor performance is of the order of 1% compared to the integral flap. On the other hand, the chord gaps significantly degrade the benefits of active flap on rotor performance due to the flow penetration between the upper and lower surfaces of the flap.",50,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031829,"Three-dimensional laminar-separation bubbles on a cambered thin wing with an aspect ratio of 6 at a Reynolds number of 60,000 have been investigated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The shear-stress transport turbulence-transition model is used to account for the effect of transition on the laminar separation-bubble development. The aerodynamic forces are compared with the experimental data available for validation. The laminar-separation bubble is shown to evolve in its shape and dimension in both chord and span directions with increasing incidence due to its interaction with the wing-tip flow and the trailing-edge separation. The strongest three-dimensional effects are found at a moderate incidence of 6 deg and at higher incidences beyond 10 deg. Within the incidence range, the two-dimensional airfoil results are not reproduced at any of the span locations, including the symmetry plane, in the three-dimensional wing case. Generally, the chordwise development of the three-dimensional laminar-separation-bubble at the symmetry plane is delayed as compared with the two-dimensional laminar-separation bubble. Another noticeable point is the association of a sudden increase in lift-curve slope due to abrupt expansion of the laminar-separation bubble at a certain incidence. This phenomenon is observed in both the two- and three-dimensional cases, but at different incidences.",50,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031845,"In this paper the computational fluid dynamics fire-field model SMARTFIRE is used to simulate a full-scale aircraft-cabin fire test conducted within the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration furnished C-133 test facility in order to provide further validation for the software. The experiment involves exposing the interior cabin materials to an external fuel fire, noting the subsequent spread of the external fire to the cabin interior and the onset of flashover, which occurs at approximately 210 s. The computational fluid dynamics fire simulations presented in this study make use of a range of sophisticated sub-models including a flame-spread model, the eddy-dissipation model, a toxicity model, and a multi-ray radiation model. The models’ ability to simulate the fire conditions within the aircraft cabin is demonstrated through its ability to 1) reproduce the measured trends in temperatures and heat fluxes at the seat tops, 2) reproduce toxic gases concentrations at locations of interest, 3) provide a reasonable prediction of the time to flashover (220 s), and 4) produce reasonable agreement with the observed fire dynamics. The predicted time to flashover is shown to be sensitive to material properties such as ignition temperature of seat materials and not very sensitive to the cabin panel thickness.",50,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031778,"The civil aircraft development cycle structure has been changing dramatically. The time from a go-ahead to a first delivery has been shortened, which puts a considerable amount of pressure on specification, design, manufacture, and testing efforts. The guarantee of a safe flight and the increasing complexity of the new generation of aircraft are forcing the industry to develop innovative techniques for new programs. Simulation has been proven to be a valuable tool that can be used. Nevertheless, the potential of simulation has not fully been explored in some phases of the aircraft development process. In flight test campaigns, it is already common to use simulation to predict an aircraft’s behavior prior to the flight or even to structure a flight test proposal. An iterative approach considering flight testing, model updates, campaign reevaluation would be efficient and safe. This manuscript discusses the matter and proposes a process that would enhance flight test campaign efficiency with interactive use of intensive simulation. The manuscript also highlights relevant aspects of the implementation of this process. Preliminary results obtained from a regional jet climb flight test campaign show that it is possible to compress the initial test matrix when an adequate model is used in conjunction with flight data.",50,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031849,"In this study, the flowfields around NACA0012 and NACA0002 airfoils at Reynolds number of 23,000 and the aerodynamic characteristics of these flowfields were analyzed using implicit large-eddy simulation and laminar-flow simulation. Around this Reynolds number, the flow over an airfoil separates, transits, and reattaches, resulting in the generation of a laminar separation bubble at the angle of attack in a certain degree range. Over an NACA0012 airfoil, the separation point moves toward its leading edge with an increasing angle of attack, and the separated flow may transit to create a short bubble. On the other hand, over an NACA0002 airfoil, the separation point is kept at its leading edge, and the separated flow may transit to create a long bubble. Moreover, nonlinearity appears in the lift curve of the NACA0012 airfoil, but not in that of NACA0002, despite the existence of a laminar separation bubble.",50,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031854,"A series of wind-tunnel experiments were conducted in which the drag characteristics and inflated geometry of model parachute canopies with rectangular parallelepiped geometries (polyhedron) were examined. The model-canopy layouts were the same as cross canopies with the adjacent sides completely attached together. All models had a base dimension of 0.2 m, and aspect ratios ranged from 0.2 to 1.2. The models did not have a central vent or any other geometric porosity. The data show the inflated geometry of the canopy differs from the constructed geometry with the smallest change occurring at a constructed aspect of 0.8 and the variation becomes larger for increasing or decreasing constructed aspect ratios. The data also indicate the aerodynamic drag coefficient, based on the projected area, has a maximum value of approximately one for the constructed aspect ratio of 0.3 corresponding to an inflated aspect ratio of 0.53. The drag coefficient is less for smaller and larger aspect-ratio models. If scaled by the canopy surface area drag of the rectangular parallelepiped canopies is lower than flat circular canopy designs. These findings are consistent with the past findings on other flexible parachute canopies and rigid bluff bodies.",50,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031856,"A comparative study of two airfoils at low Reynolds numbers using the transitional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes shear-stress transport model and the ANSYS CFX computational fluid dynamics suite is proposed. The NACA 0012 and Selig–Donovan 7003 airfoils were selected and exposed to chord-based Reynolds numbers ranging from to at angles of attack ranging from 0 to 8 deg. The adopted numerical model and setup were shown to accurately predict the main flow features. Specifically, both laminar separation without reattachment and laminar-separation-bubble flow modes were observed depending on the airfoil geometry and orientation, Reynolds number, and freestream-turbulence intensity. In general, with increasing angle of attack or Reynolds number, laminar-separation bubbles shrank and receded toward the leading edge while vortex-shedding periodicity and coherency degraded. In all cases, the Selig–Donovan 7003 proved of superior aerodynamic performance when compared to the NACA 0012, which was expected.",50,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031883,"The current lateral ground loads requirement for an aircraft during a high-speed turn was written in the middle of the last century when relatively small aircraft with tricycle landing gear arrangements started to emerge. This requirement is known to be conservative when applied to large modern passenger aircraft. Nonlinearities (such as tire forces) have a significant effect at the edge of operating envelopes, placing a renewed interest on analysis methods that can classify the dynamics in these regions. In this paper, a continuation analysis is used to assess the loads that can be generated for different aircraft configurations during high-speed turns and to compare the results to the original requirement. A comparison is made between test results from a Federal Aviation Admistration study and continuation results, where all of the significant test data points are located within an envelope constructed from a continuation analysis. Continuation analysis, therefore, provides a conservative estimate of the maximum lateral load factors. These values are, however, less than the value prescribed in the regulation.",50,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031757,"This paper considers the optimization of flight trajectories for solar-powered aircraft. This work is unique relative to past work because flight path is constrained to repeatedly traverse a specified closed ground path. Constraints of this form are of interest in a variety of missions where the goal is to loiter near a fixed point on the ground. The performance index to be maximized is the average input power to the battery over each cycle of the ground path. It is advantageous to allow the periodic flight path to have altitude variations because during both ascent and descent there are opportunities to increase the angle of sun exposure to the aircraft solar array. A novel procedure for solving the related optimization problem is described that addresses the implementation of a difficult state constraint: the flight path must belong to the surface of the vertical cylinder whose base is the closed ground path. Results for a wide collection of optimization examples are described, which lead to an important conclusion. By allowing aircraft speed and altitude to vary it is possible to obtain an average input battery power greater than the optimal power for constant speed and constant altitude.",50,1
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031894,"Maintaining stable flight of micro aerial vehicles is challenging, especially in complex, low-Reynolds-number flight environments while considering wind gust disturbance, flow separation, and flow reattachment. To date, most micro aerial vehicles use vision, inertial measurement units, and/or global positioning systems as their primary sensing and navigation devices; however, actual flow conditions over the aircraft wing surfaces cannot be captured directly. In this paper, a biologically inspired micro aerial vehicle pitch control system is designed using distributed pressure information. The pressure information on the wing surfaces of a micro aerial vehicle is directly measured by a array of digital barometric micropressure sensors and is then used to calculate the aerodynamic forces, center of pressure, pitching moment, etc. A new pitch motion model that can capture the pressure information is derived from the control perspective. A nonlinear controller is also designed to achieve accurate pitch control, which is robust with respect to bounded uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. It is anticipated that this new micro aerial vehicle design, which uses real-time sensed pressure information, can significantly enhance the stability and agility of micro aerial vehicles.",50,1
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031901,"The use of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast for meteorological monitoring is explored. Although originally developed for surveillance, the data that the system provides can be used to estimate wind, pressure, and temperature profiles. Two methods to estimate wind are presented. These make use of velocity vector information from a single aircraft or multiple aircraft, respectively. Air pressure is derived from the barometric altitude and height above the World Geodetic System 1984 ellipsoid. From this pressure estimate the temperature is estimated, using the hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law. To validate the methods, automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast data were collected over a 100 day period and the resulting estimates compared to Global Forecast System forecasts. Estimating wind using information from one aircraft resulted in a low number of estimates. When using data from multiple aircraft, more accurate wind estimates could be produced, at fixed time intervals and at altitude intervals. The mean absolute errors for wind speed and direction estimates were 9.2 kt and 29.0 deg, respectively. The mean errors for pressure and temperature estimates were  hPa and 0.8 K, respectively. The mean absolute errors for the pressure and temperature estimates were 0.8 hPa and 2.0 K, respectively.",50,1
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031818,"The effectiveness of active flow control for the reduction of flow distortion in boundary layer-ingesting serpentine inlets was examined. The intended purpose of the flow control was to redistribute the ingested low-momentum boundary-layer fluid around the periphery of the diffuser to reduce the flow distortion at the engine face. A variety of different blowing jet and suction hole configurations were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics, and a subset of these configurations was experimentally validated. Boundary-layer suction alone proved to be ineffective in reducing flow distortion, but suction did enhance the distortion reduction capability of blowing flow control when blowing mass flow rates were greater than 1% of the total inlet mass flow rate. To reduce the demand for bleed air from the engine compressor, it is suggested to augment blowing flow with the flow entrained from the suction holes using an ejector-pump concept. Application of the notional ejector-pump model resulted in a maximum decrease in engine-face distortion of 75% as measured by the parameter, as compared with a 28% reduction with blowing alone. Investigations also showed that the most practically effective flow control configurations maintained jet individuality to directly counter duct secondary flows while not combining to form large-scale vortices.",50,1
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.C031912,"Parameter estimation of cascaded fins at high angle of attack is carried out using a new neural-network approach. Two new lift models are proposed to overcome the problems faced by high angle-of-attack lift models based on Kirchhoff’s theory of flow separation. Lift modeling is carried out using a neural network for single and cascaded planar fins of airfoil and rectangular cross sections. Neural partial differentiation is applied to find the lift curve slope at zero angle of attack, which is more consistent compared to that based on average slope obtained using output-error method. Neural approach is applied to model the steady flow separation point on the fin. Separation and stall characteristic parameters are estimated using a new neural formulation. It is shown that the values of these parameters, obtained using the proposed neural method, better represent the observed lift data compared to those from the output-error method. Moreover, a modified equation is suggested to better model the steady separation point for the cascaded fins. It is shown that the new equation for the separation point, when used in conjunction with the new lift coefficient equation, produces lift coefficient values which better match the measured ones. It is also shown that for an optimum gap-to-chord ratio the separation parameter will be maximum implying a delayed stall. Further, it is shown that an increase in the number of fins in the cascade has the effect of increasing the stall angle in addition to the increase in lift curve slope.",50,1
