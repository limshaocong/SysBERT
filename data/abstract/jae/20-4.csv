The proposed controller consists of two parts, the first part is for the nominal system without disturbances and the second part is to compensate for effects of system disturbances. A dynamic relative motion error model was established to design the second part of the controller and to analyze the stability of the closed-loop system using Lyapunov stability theory. Furthermore, the robustness of proposed control method to the system disturbances is analyzed based on robust control theory. It is proven that the relative motion error of two spacecraft in formation is uniformly ultimately bounded under the proposed controller for the assumed disturbances in the dynamic model.",20,4

Hence, the general and the simplified mathematical models of ALFLEX give different images of the same reality.",20,4

This type of activity is well into the future, but there are possible near-term applications that could utilize in situ resources for protection from radiation of surface power reactors, solar flares, and micrometeorite damage. “Waterless” concrete made of sulfur, a by-product material of oxygen and carbon extractions, is a viable alternative to hydraulic cement. Sulfur–lunar regolith concrete is an ideal material for building structures on the moon. Its availability, high strength, and durability properties make it a very attractive candidate for the development of the first lunar-construction activities. Regolith-derived glass rebar and fiber can also be used with “concrete” made with in situ regolith. Development of such habitats pose tremendous challenges that can be met by the combination of innovative design with cutting-edge technologies that are appropriate for planetary surface habitats with multiple applications for Earth and beyond.",20,4
