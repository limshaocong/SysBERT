An adaptive fuzzy terminal sliding mode control is proposed for a formation flying tracking system which includes acquisition, tracking, and pointing. The relative attitude of the leader and follower spacecraft under gravity gradient torque and external periodic disturbances is controlled by four reaction wheels. First, a terminal sliding mode controller is used to obtain stable and fast tracking. Then, the adaptive fuzzy logic system is used to approximate and learn the system uncertainty with the online fault and time-varied external disturbances. The system is proved to be stable, and the parameters are proved to be bounded under the control scheme, using a Lyapunov methodology. Finally, simulation results (under actuator faults like wheel failure and wheel degradation) show that the proposed control method has the advantages of high tracking accuracy, low computation load, robustness, and ease of engineering application.",24,3

For distributed parameter systems, parametric uncertainties can be represented by random fields leading to stochastic partial differential equations. Over the past two decades, the spectral stochastic finite-element method has been developed to discretize the random fields and solve such problems. On the other hand, for deterministic distributed parameter linear dynamic systems, the spectral finite-element method has been developed to efficiently solve the problem in the frequency domain. In spite of the fact that both approaches use spectral decomposition (one for the random fields and the other for the dynamic displacement fields), very little overlap between them has been reported in literature. In this paper, these two spectral techniques are unified with the aim that the unified approach would outperform any of the spectral methods considered on their own. An exponential autocorrelation function for the random fields, a frequency-dependent stochastic element stiffness, and mass matrices are derived for the axial and bending vibration of rods. Closed-form exact expressions are derived by using the Karhunen-Loève expansion. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the unified spectral approach.",24,3

Joints store elastic energy in the folded, prestressed position and allow deployment until they are stopped by tendons. A study on a wire rope joint is first presented to determine its mechanical behavior with experimental, theoretical, and numerical approaches. An analysis is then performed on a bidimensional structure to propose the specific modeling of introducing prestress to the joints. The method is applied to a spatial system in an analysis that uses static equilibrium and kinematic deployment simulations. The results show good concordance among the different approaches.",24,3

The cohesive zone model is based on a four parameter characterization: in each mode, a range of values for the critical energy release rate and cohesive strength are computed from a set of experimental results. Values of each parameter are determined over the temperature range of 20–350°C. Owing to experimental limitations, two methods for determining the Mode I critical energy release rate are reported from the double cantilever beam test: the area method and the inverse method. The Mode I strength is determined from a button peel stress test. The values of the Mode II parameters are determined by using a mapping procedure that accounts for multiparameter dependence in models of the end notch flexure and single lap joint tests.",24,3

The blade is modeled as a tapered thin-walled beam with fiber-reinforced composite material. The dynamic response characteristics of a rotating composite beam are investigated; namely, ply angle, taper ratio, and various selected rotational speeds. To extend life and improve efficiency, a robust control methodology is implemented and structural tailoring composite properties are used. To this end, considering modeling uncertainties and external disturbance conditions, a sliding mode control is proposed and its performance and robustness are compared with the conventional linear quadratic Gaussian control.",24,3

The governing equations are simplified using long-wavelength and low Reynolds number approximations. The solutions of the problem in simplified form are calculated with three methods: (1) perturbation method, (2) homotopy analysis method, and (3) shooting method. Comparison of the three solutions shows very good agreement among them. Pressure rise and frictional force are calculated with the help of numerical integration. Graphical results for pressure rise and frictional forces are presented to show the physical behavior of the Weissenberg number We, amplitude ratio ϕ, tangent hyperbolic power law index n, and radius ratio ϕ.",24,3
6,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000069,"In this paper, a nonsymmetric rigid body rotating around a fixed point under the action of a central Newtonian field of force exerted by three centers of attraction is considered. The angular momentum principle is applied to deduce the equations of motion of this body. These equations represent a simple autonomous system of twelve nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which describe the motion of the body. The first integrals for such a system are obtained. Euler, Lagrange, and the kinetic symmetry cases are obtained as special cases from this problem. The numerical solution for this system is obtained by using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The aim is to find the influence of the characteristic parameters of the body on the motion. Two cases of study are given. The first occurs when the three attracting centers lie on the fixed axes OX, OY, and OZ, and the second occurs when these centers are reduced to one attracting center that lies on the vertical OZ-axis. A comparison between the solutions for the two previously-mentioned cases is given through computer programs.",24,3
7,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000067,"Numerical and experimental investigations are carried out to assess the possibility of controlling a flexible beam by using an electromagnetic actuator (EMA). The advantage of EMAs is that they do not require contact with the structure so they can be applied to light and small mechanisms. Nevertheless, their open-loop instability and nonlinear dynamic behavior relating to excitation frequency can limit their fields of application. The EMA is designed and dimensioned as a function of the structure to be controlled. The effect of the EMA is considered a restoring force; consequently, the structure is still linear, which enables the calculation of the modal matrices of the structure. Moreover, an inverse model of the EMA is proposed to implement a linear action block for the frequency range used. The gap distance is estimated by using a modal approximation of the displacements resulting from the measurements. The control strategy is a fuzzy controller with displacements and velocities as inputs. Fuzzy controllers are used for their effectiveness in the presence of nonlinearities and uncertainties. The system is modeled and the characteristics of the model are identified experimentally. Several control configurations are assessed by using numerical simulations, and then the controller is tested experimentally in the context of impact perturbations. The results show the effectiveness and robustness of the developed control.",24,3
8,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000068,"This paper presents a method of approaching the attitude control of an autonomously hovering unmanned helicopter system. The proportional-integral sliding mode controller (PISMC) features a combination of the conventional sliding mode control (SMC) and the integral sliding mode control (ISMC). By applying the PISMC algorithm, the controller is capable of providing stable roll and pitch control of the main rotor simultaneously. To show how PISMC may improve system performance, this paper develops an experimental unmanned helicopter system to assess the performance of the proposed controller. The results of the simulation show that the tracking error of the PISMC is not only smaller but also converges more quickly than that of the conventional SMC. Resulting roll and pitch controllers are successfully verified in computer simulations and actual flight tests. The flight test results presented in the paper are found to be consistent with the simulation results.",24,3

Driving influences include stringent launch/landing payload limitations; high costs of human time for surface deployment and operational readiness; influences of the harsh environment on structures, devices and crews; and a paucity of equipment and human and consumable resources that necessitates extreme economies. General habitat concept options are proposed along with desired attributes for comparative assessments of figure of merit (FOM) rankings. Eight broad FOM categories are applied as a basis for top-level option evaluations: (1) launch optimization features, (2) landing optimization features, (3) habitat capacity and functionality, (4) environmental factors and features, (5) deployment and operational readiness, (6) reliability and maintainability, (7) commonality with other surface systems, and (8) pathways and potentials for growth. Much of the content of this paper draws on investigations conducted by the Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture (SICSA) in support of separate National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contracts awarded to teams headed by Boeing and ILC-Dover for a “Minimum Functionality Habitation Systems Concept Study.” Comprehensive team study results were presented to NASA in February 2009 and have been publicly released to all interested parties.",24,3
10,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000072,"This paper proposes two adaptive neural controllers, termed adaptive NN controller-I and adaptive NN controller-II, for the output feedback control of spacecraft formation flying in the presence of structured and unstructured uncertainties. The proposed control scheme employs the linear reduced-order observer to generate pseudo–velocity related signals and Chebyshev neural networks to approximate unknown nonlinearities in the system dynamics. The adaptive NN controller-II, which employs a switching function to generate a switch between the robust control, using the smooth hyperbolic tangent function, and the adaptive NN control, can efficiently avoid the overestimation problem (i.e., the bound of the Chebyshev neural network’s output is larger than the corresponding bond of the approximated unknown function) existing in the adaptive NN controller-I. Hence, it requires small control input. The uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the Lyapunov direct approach. Simulation studies are presented to show the advantages of the proposed approach over the standard adaptive output feedback approach.",24,3

However, because GPS is not available in an indoor environment, indoor localization is a crucial problem in developing small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper suggests vision-based indoor localization for UAVs in GPS-denied environments. Our approach is based on image matching by applying the scale invariant feature transform algorithm.",24,3

One of the major challenges in the design of an autonomous helicopter is the development of a flight dynamic model, which can be useful for simulation studies and for the design of control law and navigational aspects. There is always a trade-off from the accuracy of the mathematical model to the more simplified model required for a control design as far as the helicopter rotor/fuselage dynamics is concerned. Small-scale helicopters posses a higher bandwidth of dynamics; hence, models developed from the first principle alone do not fulfill the needs, and more-sophisticated mathematical models are thus required. The main objective of the present work is to improve the parameterized identification model by replacing it with a most-general flight dynamic model for a minihelicopter. This model includes the rotor blade flap dynamics, stabilizer bar dynamics, and vehicle dynamics, which will be applicable for a general maneuvering flight. A systematic study is undertaken to analyze the influence of inflow models and flap response on the helicopter trim. Stability of the minihelicopter is also analyzed; except for phugoid, all other modes are stable in hover and high forward flight conditions.",24,3
13,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000066,"This paper describes an architecture for a multiagent robotic system that consists of a number of identical units. The homogeneous units are mechanically connected to construct a mobile platform named a “multiagent transportation (MAT) system.” Every unit has its local controller that communicates only with its adjacent units. This basic configuration of supervisorless structure affirmatively confines the dependence of each unit to a local area, and therefore any unit can be removed from or added into any part of a MAT system regardless of the timing and without disturbing the performance of the whole system. This flexibility of configuration significantly contributes to easy maintenance of units, such as battery charging or hot-replacing for faulty units. Utilizing this flexibility, MAT systems are able to adapt to a variety of tasks including transportation application and to target objects of various shapes and range of mass. These characteristics of MAT systems are the strong advantages for mobile robots, especially for ones activated in distant places, e.g., robotic planetary explorers. A proposed example unit of a MAT system shown in this paper employs a parallel link manipulator as its leg, and the digital-actuation (D-actuation) concept is applied for the local unit controller to actuate the leg. Together with the basic design of the example units, the controlling framework is described with simulation results to show the feasibility of the whole mobile system architecture.",24,3

A possible structural solution was proposed in the literature. The lunar base, planned to be built in a long, narrow valley with solid rock walls, would consist of three main elements: a masonry vault, supported by the rock walls of the valley; a regolith layer a few meters thick on top of it to dissipate radiation and the kinetic energy of impacting meteorites, and to balance temperature; and inflatable units under the arch to serve as a living area for humans. The objective was to check the feasibility of this idea from a structural mechanics point of view. A two-dimensional discrete-element model of the vault-regolith system was constructed, and the behavior of the structure under its own weight was analyzed. Initial simulations on the effect of meteorite impacts were conducted, but a significantly improved model would be required to continue this analysis. This note summarizes the results to date.",24,3
