The review includes a historical perspective of the center and the facilities used to conduct the research. Major NASA noise research programs are highlighted, showing their impact on the industry and on the development of aircraft noise reduction technology. Noise reduction trends are discussed, and future aircraft concepts are presented. Results show that, since the 1960s, the average perceived noise level has been reduced by about 20 dB. Studies show that, depending on the size of the airport, the aircraft fleet mix, and the actual growth in air travel, another 15–17 dB is required to achieve NASA’s long-term goal of providing technologies to limit objectionable noise to the boundaries of an average airport.",26,2

A decade later, it seemed only natural that these same aeropropulsion engineers would progress into the largely unexplored field of space chemical propulsion. Starting before the launch of Sputnik set off the great space race, researchers at the GRC were testing and flying cryogenic hydrogen-fueled engines that were an eventual key to the success of the Apollo manned missions to the moon. In the 60 years since this first foray into chemical propulsion, engineers at the GRC have made countless innovations and contributions to every component of rocket engine technology. From energetic propellants to green fuels, from innovative metallic alloys to ceramic composites, from seals and bearings to igniters and injectors, and from upper stages and satellites to launch vehicles and planetary landers, the dedicated and creative people at the GRC have propelled the United States to the forefront of space exploration and continue to work toward an even more exciting future.

This technology was successfully developed in over 20 rocket/reactor tests, which demonstrated a wide range of thrust levels, high-temperature fuel, sustained engine operation, accumulated time at full power, and restart capability—everything required for a human mission to Mars. Furthermore, NTP requires no large technology scale-up. The smallest engine tested during the Rover program—the Pewee Engine—is sufficient for this when used in a clustered engine arrangement. The GRC has led every major study involving NTP since the late 1980s and has helped quantify the evolution and growth potential of the nuclear thermal rocket (NTR), which includes the bimodal and liquid-oxygen- (LOX-) augmented NTR concepts. In NASA’s recent Mars Design Reference Architecture (DRA) study, NTP reduced total mission mass over 400 t compared with chemical propulsion. Human missions to the Moon and near-Earth asteroids are also enhanced using NTP. In 2011, NASA restarted an NTP technology demonstration effort that is continuing under the Nuclear Cryogenic Propulsion Stage project, which began in 2012. Ground demonstrations of a small, scalable NTR by 2020 are envisioned, with a flight demonstration shortly thereafter.",26,2
9,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000297,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) began experimentation with cryogenic propellants in the early 1950s to understand the potential of these high-performance propellants for use in liquid propellant rocket engines. Supporting these tests required learning how to both design cryogenic systems and develop procedures to safely and reliably work with cryogenic fuels and oxidizers. This early work led to the development of a skill set that has been core to the center ever since. When NASA was formed and the exploration missions were defined, it became clear that the ability to use cryogenic propellants in the thermal and microgravity environment of space was critical to mission success, and the agency was tasked with enabling this capability. To support development of the Centaur upper stage and the Saturn S-IVB stage, GRC researchers and engineers initiated extensive technology development for the in-space application of cryogenic fluid management (CFM). These initial efforts addressed basic requirements of propellant slosh, settling, and short-term storage/pressure control. Over the ensuing years, the NASA GRC has advanced CFM technologies to enable more reliable and capable upper stages.

Primary and rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, flywheels, and regenerative fuel cells are among the GRC’s portfolio of energy storage devices and primary power systems. These technologies have been developed for missions and applications such as low Earth orbit and geosynchronous Earth orbit satellites, space shuttle, astronaut spacesuit, International Space Station, landers and rovers, and lunar and planetary habitats. The desire for lower mass, lower volume, higher efficiency, and more reliable power systems has most often been the driving force behind the development of these technologies. Often, as with fuel cells for the early Gemini and Apollo missions, development of the technology has been mission enabling. Although many of these technologies were initially developed for applications in space, the existence of such capabilities or development successes at GRC has led to their adoption for terrestrial uses or further research and development for terrestrial applications, including electric vehicles, unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles, and all-electric aircraft.

On occasion, routine instrumentation approaches are perfectly suited for the task at hand. However, as propulsion components and systems become more complex through the incorporation of new materials and higher temperature operation, modifications to traditional instrumentation methods or entirely new methods are necessary. This paper provides a glimpse of the core electronic-based instrumentation methods developed throughout the years to measure temperature, strain, pressure, heat flux, and chemical gas species and describes how these methods are evolving to meet the instrumentation challenges of high-performance propulsion systems. It is clear that future aeropropulsion systems will operate at higher temperatures and require more onboard electronics for health monitoring and control functions. For this reason, a significant effort in high-temperature electronics based on the wide-bandgap semiconductor silicon carbide was initiated and has demonstrated several world’s first electronic sensors and devices operating at 600°C.
