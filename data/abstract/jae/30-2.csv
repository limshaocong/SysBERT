Response reconstruction is performed for structures under traffic-induced vibrations to formulate the relationship between different sets of time-domain responses. Measured acceleration responses from a structure under traffic-induced ground motions are used for damage identification with a sensitivity-based iterative model updating method. Numerical simulations on a seven-story planar frame structure are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed approach. Damage identification is conducted based on the initial finite-element model of the structure and the measured responses from the damaged state under traffic-induced vibrations. Structural elemental stiffness factors are iteratively updated until the reconstructed responses match the measured ones as closely as possible. A two-phase optimal sensor-placement scheme is proposed for better response reconstruction and subsequent damage identification. Optimal sensor placement is investigated to identify the best locations for response reconstruction and sensitivity-based damage identification. With the use of optimal sensor locations, the introduced damages can be identified effectively and accurately with nearly exact damage severity estimation and very small false positives and false negatives under a 5% noise effect.",30,2

In this paper, health monitoring on the deformation of operating metro shield tunnels influenced by a close deep excavation is investigated with a case in Shanghai. Both manual and automatic measuring methods were adopted in the safety monitoring during deep excavation, and the results of both methods are compared to analyze the deviation of measuring methods. Comparison shows that the automatic monitoring results could be affected by poor working conditions and cumulative error. It is suggested that different monitoring methods should be verified against each other to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the monitoring results. Based on the distribution of tunnel settlements, the curvature radius of tunnel deformation is obtained by the cubic B-spline method and then used in performance analysis on the tunnels. The relationship between the settlements and horizontal convergences of the shield tunnels are also studied, which shows a significant correlation. Analysis shows that there is no significant relationship between the curvature radius and settlements of the tunnel, which means monitoring and controlling the settlements plays an important role in protection of the tunnels but cannot guarantee the safety of tunnels. The real-time data of the curvature radius should also be calculated and analyzed in health monitoring and performance analysis on shield tunnels.",30,2

This paper presents a sensor-fault detection and isolation approach with application to structural health monitoring. Principal-component analysis (PCA) is first applied to model the fault-free history monitoring data to generate uncorrelated residuals, which can be seen as the projection of the additional measurement noise into the residual subspace of the PCA transform. Then, under the assumption that the measurement noise is Gaussian distributed, a statistical hypothesis test model is established for the subsequent sensor-fault detection procedure, after that two fault detectors are deduced through the rejection of the null hypothesis. Next, the missing variable approach is used to establish an isolation index to identify the specific faulty sensor. A benchmark structure developed for bridge health monitoring is adopted to validate and demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, and the analysis results indicate that the method is effective in detecting and isolating both bias and drift sensor faults.",30,2

This paper presents an effective approach for analyzing structural reliability during the service life of existing reinforced-concrete structures on the basis of monitored information. The process of lifetime structural-performance deterioration affected by reinforcement corrosion such as bond strength and load-bearing capacity is discussed. Crack growth in cover concrete due to reinforcement corrosion is demonstrated to be the main factor for structural-performance deterioration, thus it is chosen as a representative symptom for evaluating lifetime structural reliability. In order to consider the uncertainty in modeling structural-performance deterioration, the Weibull life evolution model associated with the cover concrete crack growth is employed for analyzing reliability, updating probability of failure profiles after maintenance, and evaluating optimal maintenance strategy. The results for a concrete bridge show that the proposed approach can provide reliable predictions of future structural performance and cost-effective maintenance strategy of aging reinforced-concrete structures.",30,2

Considering the mass data collected by different sensors, a reasonable assessment method on the monitoring results is necessary to evaluate the safety state of both the deep excavation itself and the surrounding environment. By introducing the conception of data fusion, a comprehensive assessment method is presented to find the anomaly in the safety monitoring results in this paper. Data fusion analyses on both a single monitoring item and the correlation of multiple monitoring items are proposed and studied. The one-class support vector machines (SVMs) are used to improve the data fusion analysis between a single monitoring item and different excavation parameters, and then developed to three-dimensional (3D) fusion analysis on a single item and multiple parameters of an excavation. The mechanical and geometric patterns between different monitoring items are studied to propose a data fusion analysis on multiple monitoring items and then to build the assessment criteria. Based on these two kinds of data fusion analysis, the mass monitoring data can be analyzed completely to assess the safety state of deep excavations. An application in two cases of deep excavation in Shanghai, China, shows that the proposed method is effective in data anomaly assessment.",30,2

This paper presents an in situ monitoring network of the Xiluodu Dam in Yunnan, China, including a deformation monitoring system using geodetic and nongeodetic monitoring. The system also includes a refined thermal monitoring system based on a slab-level active cooling system. The thermal–structural decoupling numerical analysis method for a dam–water–foundation system is presented in this study with considerations of viscoelasticity material properties and internal/external thermal loads.

Also, monitoring the condition of steel corrosion in reinforced concrete (RC) of subsea tunnels is especially imperative for ensuring structural serviceability and durability of RC structures. In this paper, monitoring the largest excavation section subsea tunnel, Xiamen Xiang’an Subsea Tunnel, is studied. It includes the layout of monitoring sections and monitoring contents, selection of monitoring locations, and the monitoring instruments.

There were transverse cracks observed predominantly in the positive moment regions and spider cracks concentrated in the negative moment region over the box beam. A typical two-span curved continuous bridge with high performance concrete (HPC) deck, steel girders and integral box-beam was selected to identify factors that affect early-age HPC deck cracking so as to mitigate the cracking issues on existing concrete continuous bridges. Extensive field tests were performed and various structural responses were collected for model calibration and structural analysis. Cracking issues due to effects of vertical temperature differentials, staging, shrinkage, settlement, tilt of piers, dead load, live load, etc., were quantitatively investigated and summarized through parametric study. Of prime interest has been the identification of the contributions of various effects on deck cracks. The present study provides better understanding of the behavior of curved composite bridges, which can be efficiently used to reduce the risk of cracking at early ages.",30,2

Various sensors are used in this SHM system to monitor different structural parameters that significantly affect the structural safety. The collected data can be analyzed using specifically developed software, thereby used for assessment of structural performance during construction. Interlinked with finite-element software, structural monitor/analysis/evaluation software is developed based on the idea of modular design, which can realize data exchange and result comparison between on-site monitoring and numerical models.

First, a fiber optic sensor (FOS)-based prestress force monitoring method is proposed for PSC girders with unbonded tendons. A temperature-effect estimation method is modeled to theoretically estimate the change of prestress force due to the temperature variation. Second, lab-scale experiments are performed on a PSC girder with a FBG sensor-embedded smart tendon. A series of temperature-variation and prestress-loss events are simulated for the PSC girder.

In application to large-scale structures, the management of accumulated massive data from a sophisticated long-term SHM system poses a challenge. A robust data management system (DMS), which not only facilitates spatiotemporal data management but also enables display in an attractive way, is highly desirable. This article presents the development of an effective visualized DMS specific for managing immense and heterogeneous SHM data by integrating nested relational database, three-dimensional (3D) model, and virtual reality (VR) technology and demonstrates its application to an instrumented supertall structure. A custom nested data model is designed to store redundant inherent temporal data and hierarchical inherent spatial data. Strategies for speeding up querying massive data are set up in the database. Making use of OpenSceneGraph (OSG) 3D engine, a 3D model is reconstructed from the 3D spatial data, which serves as a platform for data visualization. A four-dimensional (4D) animation protocol is presented by tying temporal data and construction schedule to the 3D model. The efficiency of the proposed DMS is exemplified through its application to a supertall structure instrumented with a sophisticated long-term SHM system.",30,2

In order to measure and monitor scour depth variations including deposition process, a scour monitoring system was developed in the authors’ previous study. An instrument with fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors was designed together with a reliable sensor-protection measure, of which the performance has been tested in the laboratory. In the present paper, the proposed system was applied on a field bridge with a critical scour history. Two test piles were manufactured and each was assembled with six standard 0.9 m-long (3 ft-long) segments. The two test piles were then installed beside two foundation piles of the field bridge, respectively, for long-term monitoring. Up until now, the measured sensor responses have verified the functionality of the proposed system. The estimated scour depths based on the sensor data to date match qualitatively well with the actual scour depths observed on the bridge site, and the concept of the scour monitoring design has been confirmed.",30,2

This system consists of nearly 112 sensors of various types, including four subsystems: automatic data collection subsystem, artificial maintenance management subsystem, early safety warning and comprehensive assessment subsystem, and centralized database management subsystem. The deployments and functions of this structural health monitoring system are first introduced in this paper. Then, a finite-element model updating method, which combines the substructure method with the response surface model updating method, is proposed to reconstruct the actual working state of this suspension bridge in the early safety warning and comprehensive assessment subsystem. In the remaining part, the temperature fields, strain responses, tension forces of the hangers, longitudinal displacements of the stiffening girder, and the meteorological temperature are analyzed. Through the statistical analysis, the relationship between the temperature fields was found; the temperature fields induced strains of the stiffening girder satisfies the linear relationship. The cumulative probability distribution function of the cycle-index of the same daily stress amplitude follows a Weibull distribution. The monitored relative longitudinal displacements of the stiffening girder are linearly related with the meteorological temperatures. The monitored tension forces of the hangers verify the effects of the suspender-free zones of main cables on the normal hangers for this pylon-girder detached suspension bridge.",30,2
14,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000665,"In this paper, a stable and robust filter is proposed for structural identification. This filter resolves the instability problems of the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF). Instead of ad hoc assignment of the noise covariance matrices in the EKF, the proposed stable robust extended Kalman filter (SREKF) provides real-time updating of the noise parameters. This resolves the well-known instability problem of the EKF due to improper assignment of the noise covariance matrices. Furthermore, the proposed SREKF is capable of removing abnormal data points in a real-time manner. As a result, the parametric identification results will be more reliable and have fewer fluctuations. The proposed approach will be applied to structural damage detection of degrading linear and nonlinear structures in comparison with the plain EKF, utilizing highly contaminated response measurements. It turns out that the estimation error of the state vector and the structural parameters is lower than the EKF by one and two orders of magnitude, respectively.",30,2

The method employs the dynamic distributed strain data to formulate its own virtual reference state for detection of defect locations. It uses a single line of optical fiber by way of a dynamic pulse-prepump (amplitude transfer) Brillouin scattering technique in order to acquire dynamic distributed strain data. An experimental program was designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology. The experiments involved dynamic tests of a long beam with simulated defects with small opening displacements ranging between 50 and 550 μm. The implications of this approach are significant since it enables the structure to be monitored at any stage during its service life without the need for prior reference data.,30,2

The concept of a long-gauge fiber-optic sensor and its merit to reveal local and global structural features are presented. Monitoring of a long-span bridge was performed using long-gauge sensors, and a method to calculate structural deformation distribution from the measured long-gauge strains is proposed, in which shear-deformation effect is considered because the main girder of the studied bridge is deep with a length–depth ratio of 17.9 at the end of the middle span.

Hexagonal block and tensile-shear failure criteria were implanted into the framework of the expanded distinct element method to determine two-dimensional cracking and to analyze the crack growth of the reinforced-concrete beam. Experimental tests were also carried out to verify the numerical simulation results. Numerical and experimental results show that at the cracking initiation stage, cracks appear below the loading points because of concentrated tensile stresses and grow upward. When these cracks penetrate three-quarters of the beam, cracks open in the bottom and gradually curve toward the loading points. Cracks caused by shear failure occur in the top of the beam. The beam fails because of a yielding of the longitudinal tensile reinforcement bar. Cracking and yielding of longitudinal tensile reinforcement can be identified based on a continuously descending natural frequency.",30,2
