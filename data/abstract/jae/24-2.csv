Simulation reveals that the surface free energy has great influence on the deformation and failure mechanism of metal nanowires. As a result of free surfaces and their reconstruction, the surface atoms depart from the perfect crystal lattice positions, leading to the appearance of nanocavities on the surfaces that are exposed to external load. The deformation process of nanowires undergoes expansion and connection of nanocavities from surface into inner lattices. Slip occurs during the deformation process, which is consistent with experimental phenomena. Elastic stiffness, yield, and fracture strength of nickel nanowires with various cross-sectional sizes are obtained, and the size effect on these mechanical properties is further analyzed. Based on numerical results, a set of quantitative prediction formulas are proposed, and they are capable of explaining the size sensitivity of nickel nanowires on the mechanical properties. Both the elastic modulus and yield strength of nickel nanowires are in a linear relationship with respect to the logarithm of their cross-sectional size, whereas the fracture strength exhibits an inverse relationship to the exponent of cross-sectional size of nickel nanowires. By using the MD simulation, the elastic modulus, yield strength, and fracture strength of a nickel nanowire in relationship to its cross-sectional size are well predicted, and they are in remarkable agreement with experimental and available numerical results. The present study demonstrates that the adopted MD simulation is capable of simulating the mechanical behavior of nanowires with respect to their geometrical size and providing numerical data that can be used to develop the empirical formulas on the effect of various physical and geometric parameters on their mechanical properties.",24,2

The crack in cement matrix composites is allowed to fracture under mode-I loading with three-point bending beam specimens. The influence of fiber types and their combination is quantified by using the toughness index and fracture energy. A proper hybrid combination of steel fibers and polyvinyl alcohol microfibers enhances the resistance to both the nucleation and growth of the crack. The micromechanical model of hybrid composites by using a fiber bridging law is emphasized, and the numerical model prediction closely matches the behavior obtained from the experiment. The influencing role of the material parameters in the fracture tests (e.g., the fracture toughness index and fracture energy) becomes more apparent than ones used in some conventional strength-based or fiber pullout tests, and these fracture parameters could screen the effect of fiber/microfiber reinforcement in enhancing the crack growth resistance of cementitious composites. This study demonstrates that fundamental fracture tests are effective to characterize and develop high-performance hybrid fiber–reinforced cement matrix composites.",24,2

At each scale in the analysis, the response of the appropriate RUC is represented by homogenized effective properties determined from the generalized method of cells micromechanics theory. Two different macroscale RUC architectures are considered, one for eventual finite-element implementation and the other for material design, and their differences are compared. Model validation is presented through comparison to both experimental data and detailed finite-element simulations. Results show good correlation within range of experimental scatter and the finite-element simulation. Results are also presented for parametric studies varying both the overall fiber volume fraction and braid angle. These studies are compared to predictions from classical lamination theory for reference. Finally, the multiscale analysis framework is used to predict the onset of failure in a transversely loaded triaxially braided composite. The predicted transverse failure initiation stress value shows excellent correlation and provides the bound for which linear elastic constitutive models are acceptable for implementation.",24,2

This mesoscale modeling technique is used to examine and predict the deformation and damage observed in tests of straight-sided specimens. A unit cell-based approach is used to consider the braiding architecture and the mechanical properties of the fiber tows, the matrix, and the fiber tow-matrix interface. A 0°/±60° braiding configuration has been investigated by conducting static finite-element analyses. Failure initiation and progressive degradation has been simulated in the fiber tows by using the Hashin failure criteria and a damage evolution law. The fiber tow-matrix interface was modeled by using a cohesive zone approach to capture any fiber-matrix debonding. By comparing the analytical results with those obtained experimentally, the applicability of the developed model was assessed and the failure process was investigated.",24,2
4,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000008,"As part of the quest to add the infraply scale to high-fidelity simulations of damage evolution in composites, a model of the phenomenon of delamination jumping across transverse plies is formulated by using nonlinear cohesive fracture models in the augmented finite element method (A-FEM). The nonlinearity of the fracture process zone and the interaction between multiple cracks combines to determine the details of how the delamination jump occurs. Simulations reveal that the jumping process starts with the triggering of a sequence of kinking cracks branching from the propagating delamination crack into the transverse plies. The first few kinking cracks arrest within the transverse plies just above the further interface because of the crack-retarding effects of the nonlinear process zone and the effects of material heterogeneity. Eventually, one kinking crack reaches the interface and initiates a new delamination crack, a step that is accompanied by a significant load spike. The competition between delamination and kinking cracks shows global-local coupling: kinking cracks are triggered when the local stress satisfies a critical condition, but a kinking crack does not reach the second interface and initiate the new delamination crack until the global energy release rate reaches the kinking crack toughness. This suggests that the jumping process is controlled more by deterministic load and geometrical factors than by stochastic flaw populations.",24,2
5,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000023,"A new methodology for concurrent dynamic analysis and structural fatigue prognosis is proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology is based on a novel small timescale formulation of material fatigue crack growth that calculates the incremental crack growth at any arbitrary time within a loading cycle. It defines the fatigue crack kinetics based on the geometric relationship between the crack-tip opening displacement and the instantaneous crack growth rate. The proposed crack growth model can be expressed as a set of first-order differential equations. The structural dynamics analysis and fatigue crack growth model can be expressed as a coupled hierarchical state-space model. The dynamic response (structural level) and the fatigue crack growth (material level) can be solved simultaneously. Several numerical problems with single-degree-of-freedom and multiple-degree-of-freedom cases are used to show the proposed methodology. Model predictions are validated by using coupon testing data from open literature. Following this, the methodology is demonstrated by using a steel girder bridge. The proposed methodology shows that concurrent structural dynamics and material fatigue crack growth analysis can be achieved. Cycle-counting method in the conventional fatigue analysis can be avoided. Comparison with experimental data for structural steels shows a satisfactory accuracy by using the proposed coupled state-space model.",24,2
6,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000027,"An apparent analytical peculiarity or paradox in the bending behavior of elastic-composite beams with interlayer slip, sandwich beams, or other similar problems subjected to boundary moments exists. For a fully composite beam subjected to such end moments, the partial composite model will render a nonvanishing uniform value for the normal force in the individual subelement. This is from a formal mathematical point of view in apparent contradiction with the boundary conditions, in which the normal force in the individual subelement usually is assumed to vanish at the extremity of the beam. This mathematical paradox can be explained with the concept of boundary layer. The bending of the partially composite beam expressed in dimensionless form depends only on one structural parameter related to the stiffness of the connection between the two subelements. An asymptotic method is used to characterize the normal force and the bending moment in the individual subelement to this dimensionless connection parameter. The outer expansion that is valid away from the boundary and the inner expansion valid within the layer adjacent to the boundary (beam extremity) are analytically given. The inner and outer expansions are matched by using Prandtl’s matching condition over a region located at the edge of the boundary layer. The thickness of the boundary layer is the inverse of the dimensionless connection parameter. Finite-element results confirm the analytical results and the sensitivity of the bending solution to the mesh density, especially in the edge zone with stress gradient. Finally, composite beams with interlayer slip can be treated in the same manner as nonlocal elastic beams. The fundamental differential equation appearing in the constitutive law associated with the partial-composite action in a nonlocal elasticity framework is discussed. Such an integral formulation of the constitutive equation encompassing the behavior of the whole of the beam allows the investigation of the mechanical problem with the boundary-element method.",24,2

This can lead to an inefficient design, because excess margins will exist for all properties except the one that determines the gauge. The design of a material can be made practical by creating a hybrid composite consisting of two or more types of fibers or resins, each embellishing a particular trait or function to the material. This paper investigates both high- and low-energy hail impact against a toughened-epoxy, intermediate-modulus, carbon-fiber composite using both experimental and analytical means. The effect of introducing ply-level hybridization by substituting up to 20% of the plies with glass-reinforced plies is considered. It is found that delamination can be reduced by this hybridization, but the benefits are dependent on the impact energy and the test conditions. A computational model based on the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics is used to understand the benefits and trade-offs in hybridization.",24,2

The transverse shear deformations in each sublayer of bimaterial bonded beams are included by modeling the specimen as individual Timoshenko beams, and the effect of interface crack-tip deformation on the compliance and ERR are taken into account by applying the interface deformable bilayer beam theory (flexible-joint model). The higher accuracy of the present analytical solutions for both the compliance and ERR of mixed-mode fracture specimens is manifested by comparing them with the solutions predicted by the conventional beam theory (CBT) and finite-element analysis (FEA). As an application example, the fracture of wood–fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) bonded interface is experimentally evaluated by using mixed-mode fracture specimens [i.e., four-point asymmetric end-notched flexure (4-AENF) and four-point mixed-mode bending (4-MMB)], and the corresponding values of critical ERRs are obtained. Comparisons of the compliance rate change and the resulting critical ERR based on the CBT, the present theoretical model, and FEA demonstrate that the crack-tip deformation plays an important role in accurately characterizing the mixed-mode fracture toughness of hybrid material bonded interfaces under four-point bending load.",24,2

The application of this technology in practice has been highly successful, but there are concerns about its long-term performance and durability. Numerous studies have been devoted to the durability of concrete-FRP interface regarding bond evaluation and potential for delamination, but not much information is available on the effects of concrete substrate repair for deteriorated components, which is a necessary step before application of FRP reinforcement. This paper is part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program with CFRP of nearly 1,000 concrete T-beam bridges for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The focus of this paper is on an exploratory study to evaluate the most effective concrete substrate repair method for damaged concrete beams by accelerated corrosion, subsequently reinforced for flexure with CFRP fabric and tested to failure. The contributions of this paper are, however, much broader, and provide valuable guidelines to design a comprehensive research program on this topic as well as sufficient practical recommendations for applications in practice, including (1)  an in-depth literature review with a useful summary reference table; (2) a prescription for producing porous, chloride-contaminated, and low-strength concrete, to simulate field conditions on the basis of microstructure evaluations of collected samples; (3) advice on proper implementation of accelerated corrosion to achieve consistency of results and, more importantly, to achieve damage characteristics resembling closely observed field conditions; and (4) evaluation of two widely used substrate repair methods: (a) polymer crack-injection and (b) replacement of concrete cover with polymer-modified concrete (PMC) containing corrosion inhibitor. The experimental program consisted of testing large-scale beams [15.2×20.3×274.3  cm (6×8×108  in.)] damaged by induced electric current. After repairing the concrete substrate, and subsequent bonding of the CFRP flexural reinforcement and shear anchors, the beams were subjected to a second cycle of accelerated corrosion and tested to failure under a 4-point bending load. The second-cycle corrosion-induced aging was used to indirectly evaluate long-term performance after CFRP retrofitting. The results showed that concrete cover replacement with PMC provided better load capacity and failure mode, indicating better long-term durability performance. This research is expected to contribute to guidelines for concrete patch repair of CFRP-retrofitted concrete bridge girders, to ensure better long-term performance under service loads and environmental effects.",24,2

The LDF is defined in the both the AASHTO Standard Specifications and the LRFD Specifications primarily for concrete slabs and has inherent applicable limitations. This paper provides explicit formulas using series solutions for LDF of orthotropic bridge decks, applicable to various materials but intended for fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) decks. The present formulation considers important parameters that represent the response characteristics of the structure that are often omitted or limited in the AASHTO Specifications. A one-term series solution is proposed based on the macroflexibility approach, in which the bridge system is simplified into two major components, deck and stringers. The governing equations for the two components are obtained separately, and the deflections and interaction forces are solved by ensuring displacement compatibility at stringer lines. The LDF is calculated as the ratio of the single stringer interaction force to the summation of total stringer interaction forces. To verify this solution, a finite-element (FE) parametric study is conducted on 66 simply supported concrete slab-on-steel girder bridges. The results from the series solution correlates well with the FE results. It is also illustrated that the series solution can be applied to predict LDF for FRP deck-on-steel girder bridges, by favorable comparisons among the analytical, FE, and testing results for a one-third-scale bridge model. The scale test specimen consists of an FRP sandwich deck attached to steel stringers by a mechanical connector. The series solution is further used to obtain multiple regression functions for the LDF in terms of nondimensional variables, which can be used for simplified design purposes.",24,2
