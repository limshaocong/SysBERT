These changes are attributable, in part, to the developments of a number of aerospace, learning and other leading-edge technologies and their synergistic combinations and convergence. The related technologies include ubiquitous, cloud, and petascale/exascale computing; ultrahigh-bandwidth networks; pervasive wireless communication; intelligent autonomous robotics; artificial general intelligence; powerful game engines and facilities; networked immersive virtual environments and virtual worlds; augmented and enhanced reality; and novel human-technology interfaces. This paper describes some of the frontiers of, and challenges in, future aerospace systems and the drivers for transformative changes in aerospace engineering education. The need to have a holistic perspective and a comprehensive approach for aerospace education, research, training, and accelerated workforce development is outlined. A starting point to accomplish this task is the development of an intelligent adaptive cyber-physical ecosystem for the aerospace workforce. The continuously expanding major components of the ecosystem include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities; novel agent-supported visual simulations (with cognitive learning and understanding abilities); immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual world facilities; intelligent, multimodal and humanlike interfaces; and smart mobile wireless devices. The ecosystem will provide timely, engaging, personalized/collaborative, and tailored visual learning. It will stimulate creativity and innovation and prepare the learners to work in future global virtual collaborative enterprises and become leaders in a world of growing complexity.",24,4

The computation results indicate that the maximum adjustable excess of a ramp-input model is 67.7%. According to the step-input and the ramp-input models, theoretical analysis shows that the ramp-input signal can be treated as a step-input signal when the time of ramp input is less than one-tenth of system oscillation periods, and the simulation results indicate that the difference of the maximal excess of both ramp and step models is no more than 7%. Both the step-input and ramp-input models have carried out digital simulations using software and the electrohydraulic assimilation method. The simulation results show that by adjusting pipe-cubage model system parameters, such as cubage, length of pipe, and diameter of pipe, the standard pulse can be produced.",24,4

The material characterization was developed and put forth for selection and use in a spectrum of applications spanning the industries of aerospace, defense, chemical, marine, and commercial products. Test specimens were prepared from the as-received plate stock of the material with the stress axis both parallel (longitudinal) and perpendicular (transverse) to the rolling direction of the plate. The test specimens were cyclically deformed at a constant load ratio of 0.1, at different values of maximum stress, and the corresponding cycles-to-failure is presented. The cyclic fatigue fracture surfaces were examined in a scanning electron microscope to establish the macroscopic fracture mode, the intrinsic features on the fatigue fracture surface, and the role of applied stress-microstructural feature interactions in governing failure. The intrinsic features on the fracture surface as a function of maximum stress and resultant cyclic fatigue life are discussed.",24,4

An important consideration in the design of z-pinned structures is the deterioration of the in-plane mechanical properties of the composite material because of the pins. Experimental property data presented in this paper reveal that large improvements to the delamination toughness of carbon-epoxy composite gained with z-pins also result in an unavoidable reduction to the in-plane tension, compression, bending, interlaminar shear, and fatigue properties. The data show that increasing the volume fraction of z-pins in carbon-epoxy to increase the delamination resistance causes a corresponding deterioration to the in-plane properties, and this is a key consideration in the design of z-pinned aircraft structures for damage tolerance. The data reveal that the reduction to the in-plane mechanical properties caused by z-pins is usually modest (typically less than 5–15%) compared to the very large improvements in delamination toughness (up to nearly 500%).",24,4

The direct shear test provides a unique mode of failure that aids the development of excavation tools for the Moon. Relative density and normal load were varied to study the strength behavior of such granular material at peak and critical state conditions. The values of the internal friction angle ranged from 30 to 70°. A relationship between the internal friction angle of the direct shear and the published triaxial compression test results is presented. Additionally, the measured dilatancy angle is related to the difference in peak and critical state stress friction angles.",24,4

We are developing an automatic cleaning system that uses electrostatic force. It employs an alternating electrostatic field that forms a barrier on the surface of fabrics. In this study, we applied single-phase rectangular voltage to parallel wire electrodes stitched into the insulating fabric of space suits. By applying mechanical vibration and operating the system in a vacuum, we realized high performance: the cleaning rate exceeded 80%. Flicking out particles smaller than 10 μm in diameter that were trapped between fibers was difficult, but this system can perform preliminary space suit cleaning and save precious time for astronauts on the moon.",24,4

Such instability can be contained by using mass and stiffness balancing and the shape and attitude of the aircraft in flight. Passive methods and pilot-operated devices such as dampers, ailerons, flaps, and other actuators, are currently used. Also, ongoing attempts exist to develop self-adaptive controls by using piezoelectric and other devices. The present work is concerned with controlling aerodynamic flutter by using stress-induced elements in selected structural components of the aircraft wing. A scheme has been developed to determine the “optimal” locations for such elements to be activated, in real time, to contain the dynamic instability or flutter condition. Various stress-induced stiffening schemes have been developed to modify the frequency response of aircraft wings by shifting the critical flutter speed to safe levels. Results and conclusions include the identification of the optimal location and type of the stress-induced elements and the magnitude and distribution of induced stress for best results with the least expense of energy during actuation.",24,4

Multiinput multioutput (MIMO) proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control law is reformulated into a full-state feedback control law to synthesize the controller by using robust H∞ control theory. In full-state feedback representation, PID control has implicit integral-backstepping structure. Therefore a new parameter, ρ, can be introduced that acts on the derivative of the control signal. The parameters of MIMO PID controller are then obtained with solving the algebraic Riccati equation with selecting the values of ρ and γ. Model helicopter simulation is carried out to verify the performance of the proposed controller to stabilize the uncertain helicopter model and to suppress external disturbances.",24,4

The algorithm leverages advances in several theoretical fields, including robotics, homing guidance, and airspace management, and considers several approaches to conflict detection and resolution, including the collision cone approach. The collision-avoidance system is exercised and tested by using operational hardware and platforms. Novel developments by using an aggregated collision cone approach allow each unmanned aircraft to detect and avoid collisions with two or more other aircraft simultaneously. The collision-avoidance system is implemented by using a miniature unmanned aircraft with an onboard autopilot. Various simulation and flight test cases are used to demonstrate the algorithm’s robustness to different collision encounters at various engagement angles. The flight test results are compared with ideal, software-in-the-loop, and hardware-in-the-loop tests. The results presented are the first known flight tests of two or more unmanned aircraft systems equipped with the same global, three-dimensional, geometric collision-avoidance system.",24,4

Based on the Clohessy-Wiltshire (C-W) equations, and by simultaneously considering the practical situations such as parameter uncertainty, output tracking, performance cost and poles assignment, a new relative dynamic model is developed, and a robust guaranteed cost output tracking control problem is formulated. Then, by a Lyapunov approach, the existence conditions for admissible controllers are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and the controller design is cast into a convex optimization problem subject to LMI constraints. With the obtained controllers, the homing phase can be completed with a guaranteed cost. An illustrative example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller design method.",24,4

Equations of spatial motion of the mass center and the tether libration are deduced, but only the planar motion with constant rotation rate is discussed. First, the equation of the mass center is simplified and solved analytically for the scenario where the system is moving in the neighborhood of the libration point. The analytical solution indicates that both a bounded solution and periodical solution exist. A fully nonlinear dynamics analysis is then performed. A numerical method combining continuation and piecewise differential corrections is applied to obtain the periodical solution. Tether tension is also investigated. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical method and the existence of the periodical orbits. The influence of parameters, such as spin rate, mass ratio of end satellites, and tether length are analyzed.",24,4

The performance of the actuation system plays a decisive role in determining the performance of the flight control system for a highly maneuverable missile. To control the missiles by aerodynamics, control surfaces, sometimes called fins, are used. Deflection angles of these fins are the control variables of aerodynamics, but aerodynamicists prefer to use analytic variables called aileron, elevator, and rudder instead of these physical variables because these three analytic variables dominantly influence the roll, pitch, and yaw motion of the missile, respectively; and each can be considered a linear combination of four fin deflection angles. On that basis, roll, pitch, and yaw autopilots for controlling the attitudes or lateral acceleration of the missile are designed, and aileron, elevator, and rudder commands, respectively, are generated as consequence outputs of each autopilot. In the existing fin-actuation control scheme for the typical tail-fin controlled cruciform missiles, these outputs are distributed to four fin defection commands. After that, the four fins are actuated by fin controllers so that their deflections follow the commands. This paper shows that such control schemes can cause a significant deterioration in flight control system performance when fin-actuators have certain physical constraints such as slew rate, voltage, or current limit, or have an uncertainty of actuator dynamics, and proposes a new control scheme that alleviates such problems. This scheme can be widely applied to various fin-actuation control systems. But in this paper, for convenience, a tail-fin controlled cruciform missile is used as the example, and the proposed control scheme is shown to give better performance than the existing one.",24,4
