To study the mechanical response of composite honeycomb sandwich structures under high-velocity impact, an extended P-α model was developed to describe the equivalent property of honeycomb materials. Extended P-α model parameters were determined using analytical and experimental techniques. Based on the equivalent model, the impact response had good agreement between the experimental results and numerical simulation. By comparison with the detailed model in terms of ballistic limit, residual velocity, maximum displacement of the projectile, and contact time, the results from the equivalent model are not only reliable but also computationally efficient, because the equivalent model requires only 25% as much time as the detailed model under the same conditions.",33,4

In particular, T-bars are typical structural components commonly used in aerospace engineering, playing significant roles in load-carrying. Thus, the health states of T-bars largely affect the integrity and safety of aircraft structures. This paper presents a novel defect-detection method for T-bars relying on the examination of propagation characteristics of multimode guided waves. To select proper wave frequencies and modes that are sensitive to different locations of defects in T-bars, the dispersion curves and cross-sectional mode shapes of multimode guided waves are investigated systematically using the semianalytical finite element (SAFE) method. A defect localization strategy is then developed based on the multimode characteristics, able of identifying defects both along the longitudinal direction and the cross-sectional region. A weighted gathering method is presented to reduce the interference from the modes other than the selected ones, giving rise to increased accuracy of defect identification. Both finite element (FE) simulations and experiments are performed for an aluminum T-bar structure to validate the feasibility and precision of the proposed method.",33,4

Taking the flexible spacecraft as an application background, the natural characteristics of a jointed-panel structure is investigated in this paper. Based on the energy conservation principle and Rayleigh-Ritz method, an analytical approach for obtaining the natural frequencies and extracting global mode functions of the flexible jointed-panel structure was developed. Considering the solar panel as an isotropic rectangular plate and the connection at each hinge as a joint with an additional linear rotational spring, the natural frequencies and the corresponding global mode functions were obtained theoretically for the transverse vibration of the solar array. Simulation results for a typical solar array with two panels are given and were used to validate the proposed approach by comparing the obtained natural frequencies and those calculated from the finite-element method. The discussion for the effect of the rotational spring stiffness on the accuracy of the natural frequencies obtained by the proposed approach was conducted. It is shown that the natural frequencies obtained are matched very well with those from the finite-element method for a moderate stiffness of the rotational spring. The proposed approach can provide a theoretical basis for the preliminary design, the nonlinear dynamic analysis, and the design of active vibration controller for the solar array.",33,4

Regolith, which covers the planet’s surface, can be used to produce a Martian concrete but this requires the development of a binder system that is suited to unique conditions present on Mars. This paper presents the development of a magnesium silica binder system that could be produced from materials available on the surface of Mars. Magnesium oxide, amorphous silica, and water were combined with four different Mars regolith analogues from New Zealand to produce mortar cube samples. The sensitivity of the binder system to variations in a water–cement ratio was also determined for a single regolith analogue. The fresh properties of each mix were determined and the mechanical characteristics of porosity and compressive strength were assessed at 7, 28, and 90 days. The results showed that magnesium silica binder–regolith system achieved compressive strengths in excess of 35 MPa at 90 days, which would be suitable for a wide variety of Martian structural applications.",33,4

Analytical modeling was conducted to determine the shock location and shock angle, providing a guideline for system design and performance. Thereafter, numerical simulation was performed to understand the effects of the injection pressure, injection location, injection angle, and injectant on thrust vectoring performance. Satisfactory agreement between the analytical modeling and numerical simulation suggests that shock reflection within the nozzle must be avoided to produce efficient thrust vectoring. Numerical results showed that both the injection pressure and the injection location have significant impacts on the thrust angle. The lateral thrust, and hence the thrust angle, was found to increase with the injection pressure and to be larger when the injection was situated closer to the nozzle exit. Impacts of the injection angle and the injectant on the thrust angle were found to be insignificant. However, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can be more effective at producing a side thrust than can air.",33,4

However, some studies depend on methods that require significant computing time or are not applicable in the time-transient domain. Thus, this study focuses on constructing an aerodynamic analysis that is suitable for UAS flight simulation. First, unsteady dynamic inflow and blade element theory (BET) are combined in a feedback loop form. Additionally, rigid blade flapping, which is not considered for UAS analysis, is adopted. A parametric study is conducted under various forward conditions and the results of the proposed aerodynamic analysis are compared and verified with experimental results obtained in previous studies. The results indicate that the flight performance of a multirotor UAS is significantly affected when rigid blade flapping is considered. Specifically, while the drag shows discrepancy greater than 30% when the rigid blade flapping is not considered, it will decrease to a range smaller than 10% when the relevant term is considered. This matches well with the experimental results. As a result, the aerodynamic analysis presented in this study can be applied to flight simulations and nonlinear control algorithms for unsteady flight conditions.",33,4

The target reference frame is defined by using the pointing vector from the spacecraft to the target. Attitude kinematics based on the new set of attitude parameters is subsequently derived. To accomplish fast attitude maneuver, a cascade-saturation controller is then designed based on the proposed attitude parameters. The constraints of slew rate and control torque are considered in the proposed cascade-saturation controller. The stability of the resulting closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov theory.

To meet the requirement of aesthetics, the confined hollow space can be used to house a damper. This paper proposes new types of pounding-tuned mass damper for vibration control of a confined space (PTMD-CS). Both a double-sided PTMD-CS (DS-PTMD-CS) and a single-sided PTMD (SS-PTMD-CS) were proposed for use in a confined space. To examine the control performance and robustness of the proposed PTMDs-CS, a hollow steel tube was chosen as the control object. The proposed PTMD-CS was installed inside the confined space of the hollow steel tube. The simulation and experiments were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the damper. To study the damper’s robustness, the natural frequency of the PTMD is tuned away from the structural resonance frequency and forced vibration tests were conducted. The simulation results indicate that the damper can reduce the vibration amplitude significantly even in the detuned cases and has a strong robustness. In addition, the experimental results agree well with the numerical results, which indicate that the pounding force model in this paper is accurate.",33,4

However, the continuous injection of an auxiliary signal will increase the residual error. In this paper, a logic unit is proposed to remove such a drawback from the LMS-based control algorithm. The logic unit decides whether to start/stop injecting an auxiliary signal. The start procedure (SAP) and stop procedure (SOP) send out trigger signals of the logic unit. A flexible structure, which has a time-varying concentrated mass, was established to investigate the adaptive control method. Simulation and experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the logic unit.

The problem may appear in every flying platform, and its consequences can lead to a serious accident. To counteract the aircraft’s lower maneuverability, the adaptive system could be added. That is why, a reconfiguration of unmanned aircraft flight control system was a subject of research project. The developed system uses the other control surfaces and engine to take over scope of stuck control surface. One of the system validation test involved human operators to recognize their reactions while the system is active. The test was performed with the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight simulator with implemented reconfiguration algorithm. The paper presents the results of an experiment during which the various configuration and failures were tested. A group of UAV operators repeated a simple maneuver task—slalom, under different failure settings. To assess the system and operators’ workload during the test, a subjective assessment was done. The Cooper-Harper, Bedford scales, and overall workload questionnaires were used. To get a full spectrum of the operators’ responses to the reconfiguration system, the objective evaluation was also done. The UAV flight parameters (velocities, accelerations, and position) were registered automatically during the flight tests. Based on those data, the quality index of each flight was generated, providing the objective flight performance assessment.",33,4

The present study, which focuses on low-speed close-coupled biplanes, discovers a new mechanism that could increase the overall maximum lift-to-drag ratio of the configuration. This paper proposes a combination of geometrical parameters that achieves good aerodynamic performance through a set of constructive wing interferences of close-coupled NACA4412 biplanes. With this combination of parameters, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio of a biplane is improved by 3.69% relative to the maximum summative lift-to-drag ratio of two independent monoplanes at Re=3×106. Moreover, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio of a biplane is enhanced by 3.99% relative to that of a single monoplane and is 10.26% higher than the maximum summative lift-to-drag ratio of two independent monoplanes at Re=3×105. This paper studies three effects of the close-coupled wing interference. First, the upward wash effect on the upper wing induced by the lower wing is investigated. Second, the forward and upward pushing effects on the upper wing at the high pressure zone around the stagnation point of the lower wing is studied. Third, the pressure distribution melioration along the upper surfaces of both wings contributed by the positive pressure gradient zone near the narrow flow path between the upper and lower wings is examined. These effects collectively guarantee a high lift-to-drag ratio of a close-coupled biplane. The concept of the total pressure boundary layer is proposed to analyze the effects of the Reynolds number. The enhancement of the third effect is found to lead to a biplane’s better performance over that of a monoplane when Re decreases.",33,4

A key challenge is rapid trajectory generation around obstacles while accommodating vehicle constraints. A UAV model with nonlinear dynamic constraints provides more natural accommodation of the vehicle’s constraints than a kinematic model with linear constraints. This paper presents a method for using finite horizon model predictive control with a custom solver that offers low solution time.

First, a discrete representation of the FRF is proposed such that the integral FRF variation within the frequency range can be indicated effectively and efficiently by means of the dynamic responses at several specified characteristic frequency points. As a consequence of this approximation, the continuous FRF constraint is well represented through a few discrete constraints at those characteristic frequencies. Then, an evolutionary optimization procedure is developed based on the FRF sensitivity analysis. In the optimization procedure, the FRF amplitude is reduced while the resonance peaks (eigenfrequencies) within the frequency range of interest are essentially kept. The minimum weight design of a structure is obtained indirectly from a preliminary design by a lesser increase of the weight together with a significant reduction of the structural FRF. Finally, the proposed optimization method is verified through two typical examples, and the obtained results show that the present optimal design approach on an FRF constraint is superior to the natural frequency constraint for overall attenuation of the structural dynamic responses in a wide frequency range.",33,4

This paper presents a momentum-based, online, one-step identification method for estimating inertial parameters of tumbling targets with linear momentum by space robots after capture. For obtaining the target’s mass and mass center, the method is the same as the traditional momentum-based method, while two contributions are made for identifying inertia tensor. The first contribution is the second-order term mnrn×vn in the identification equation is written as the product of two functions: function of time and function of mass and mass center of the target. Secondly, the traditional recursive least squares (RLS) method is modified to obtain the corresponding inertia tensor without iteration from the beginning. To verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed identification technique, 2D and 3D models with different targets and initial velocities are both simulated and analyzed. The simulation results show that all the estimated values converge to their ideal values and the method can be easily achieved online via recursive techniques.",33,4

Nevertheless, the existing sinusoidal model will encounter trouble in precisely yielding the buckling loads of layered structures composed of layers with different material properties. Thus, a refined sinusoidal model is offered for the buckling analysis of composite and sandwich structures that can simulate the zigzag effect of the in-plane displacement and meet the free conditions of transverse shear stresses on the surfaces. In the light of the elegant sinusoidal model, a three-node beam element has been constructed to work out the discrete eigenvalue equation coming from the stability behavior. Making use of a mixed variational theorem from the literature, the finite-element formulation can meet beforehand the continuous conditions of transverse stress at the interfaces. The three-dimensional finite element method (3D-FEM) results are utilized to evaluate the precision and efficiency of the proposed approach through a numerical example. The proposed finite-element formulation can produce satisfactory results with lower calculational cost, and some interesting conclusions are presented. However, the results for stability of layered structures made of plies with different material properties will be overestimated by utilizing the models violating the continuous prerequisite of interlaminar stresses.",33,4

New designs incorporating these novel propulsion systems face the issue of penalizing battery characteristics, especially in terms of limited energy and power density performance, in turn imposing a toll on the inert weight of the machine. A possible solution to this issue is that of structural batteries.

The proposed approach is composed of an offline and an online phase. The objectives of the offline phase are to carry out data dimensionality reduction and to establish the mapping relationship between sensor data and damage status. First, a comprehensive database is established via high-fidelity finite element method (FEM) simulations (ABAQUS software) to determine guided Lamb wave responses (e.g., displacement and acceleration) under various prescribed structural damage conditions. Then, the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is applied to extract key features from these responses under each simulated case. Finally, a neural network-based surrogate model is developed to relate the damage status with modal coefficients of the POD. The goal of the online phase is to quantify the damage location and extent using limited sensor measurements. The gappy proper orthogonal decomposition (GPOD) is employed to reconstruct the full field information based on limited sensor data. Subsequently, the associated damage extent and location are derived by applying the surrogate model developed in the offline phase. The proposed data-driven SHM approach is comprehensively validated using simulation data harvested from both beam and plate examples. The maximum error between evaluated and actual damage values is within 10%. Parametric studies are conducted as well to investigate the effects on damage detection using different sensor placement and sensor types.

The nonlinearity of piston theory is determined by its high-order terms, which are significantly influenced by different working conditions. However, theoretical studies of the nonlinearity of high-order terms receive little attention. Based on previous works, this study discussed the physical meaning of high-order terms in piston theory and conducted a detailed theoretical analysis of the nonlinear behavior of high-order terms. Results demonstrated that the physical meaning of high-order terms denotes the nonlinearity of weak shocks (nonisentropic) and expansions, which can be approximated by isentropic theory in small vibrations. However, when the vibration amplitude and Mach number are large, shocks become stronger (the hypersonic similarity parameter exceeds 0.6) and the nonisentropic effect of shocks becomes significant, leading to the invalidation of piston theory.

Instantaneous plots of discrete vortices and thickness of the mixing layer are obtained to examine the variation of coherent structures and the spatial spreading rate. Results show that transverse forcing has a huge effect on the initial development of the mixing layer. The forcing frequency is able to govern the eddy roll-up and interactions, and the size of saturate eddies is determined by the convective velocity and forcing frequency and is independent on the forcing amplitude.

Experiments were performed in four chordwise sections (x/c=0.5, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) at two Reynolds numbers (R=1×104 and 2.5×104) and different angles of attack (α=5°, 10°, 15°, and 25°). It was observed that the secondary vortex is dominant on flow characteristics of double delta wings at low Reynolds numbers. The strengths of vortices increase with increases of both the wing sweep angle and Reynolds number. Furthermore, the location of wing vortex breakdown moves farther downstream as the wing sweep angle increased. Depending on the angle of attack, Reynolds number, and the wing sweep angle, either dual (strake and wing) or triple (strake, wing, and secondary) leading-edge vortices were observed. At a Reynolds number value R=1×104 and angles of attack in the range of α≤15°, the interactions of the vortices influence the flow structure significantly. Dominant frequencies of the vortices are detected near the shear layer formed between the strake vortex and secondary vortex, generally. Moreover, the spectral analyses indicated that bursting of the vortices causes complicated flow patterns over double delta wings, including small-scale vortices.

The authors propose a geometry that seeks to address the requirements of such a mating interface. The proposed solution is based on the bayonet interface, using L- and T-shaped so-called female grooves and male studs connected and disconnected together through a series of clockwise and counterclockwise rotations and single-point clamping events. This routine allows the transfer of both percussion through the drill string and torque in both directions of rotation, while permitting the accurate disconnection of individual drills bits at the required location. Sustained laboratory and field drilling operations suggest that bayonet-style connections offer a reliable solution to the problem of autonomous assembly and disassembly of drill strings in a planetary exploration setting. This paper discusses the development of such a connection system, based on the bayonet connection, which has been implemented in the overall architecture of the Ultrasonic Planetary Core Drill (UPCD).

The tests consist of measuring aerodynamic forces and moments using the six-component balance for strain metering. The slope of lift coefficient curve, lift coefficient value, and maximum aerodynamic efficiency value increase due to the presence of the ground. Also, the total aerodynamic center location moves backward as a result of the presence of the ground. It was observed by comparing the data for ground effect with those for out-of-ground effect that ground proximity significantly increases horizontal tail effectiveness as a component of pitching moment control.",33,4

The Meixi Lake community in Changsha, China, was selected as a case study to demonstrate the assessment procedure. First, two numerical models, the large domain model (LDM) and small domain model (SDM), were established for large eddy simulations (LES). Second, the multiscale coupling technique, which combined weather research forecasting (WRF) and computation fluid dynamics (CFD), was used to obtain the wind inlet boundary for LDM. Further coupling between LDM and SDM was conducted to obtain the detailed wind field distribution at the inlet boundary for SDM by using the polynomial fitting method. Finally, the exceedance probability assessment of the pedestrian wind environment in the sample community was demonstrated on the basis of joint probability density distribution function of the wind speed and wind direction obtained from historical meteorological data. Results show that multiscale coupling and high-precision interpolation techniques can provide reasonable inlet velocity boundary conditions, and the rationality was successfully verified by the measured data. Furthermore, reasonable inlet boundaries can be obtained to evaluate the pedestrian wind environment using the multiscale coupling technique. The uncomfortable wind environment usually occurs outside groupings of buildings and near high-rise buildings. This assessment framework can serve as a practical tool to evaluate pedestrian safety and comfort among grouped buildings in communities.",33,4

Stepped-sine excitation is a crucial testing method for nonlinear structures. This method can provide high signal-to-noise measurement data but requires a long measurement time. The disadvantage of lengthy measurements stems mainly from the prolonged time for a structure to reach a steady-state response in each frequency step. Although stepped-sine testing has been applied in numerous studies, there is still no uniform criterion to exactly indicate the moment when the response of a testing structure begins to achieve a steady state. In this study, a precise and novel criterion for evaluating stationarity in nonlinear structural dynamics based on the trend of the squared 2-norm of sinusoidal fitting residual vectors is proposed. Three numerical examples show that the steady-state response determined periodically by the criterion is in good agreement with the results of the theoretical analysis, which demonstrates that the presented criterion not only can assist engineers and researchers in accurately checking steady-state response but also can reduce the unnecessary and redundant waiting time during stepped-sine testing; therefore, the comprehensive performance of stepped-sine testing applied in nonlinear structures can be improved.",33,4

An interesting and challenging field is to manufacture unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) components and models using three-dimensional (3D) printing. This study focuses on the design, preliminary aerodynamics analysis, manufacture, and assembly of a small UAV using fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology. From the preliminary aerodynamic analysis of the UAV model it was found that the highest Cl/Cd of the UAV model is 14.67 at a 4° angle of attack, which corresponds with cruise airspeed of 20  m/s. The UAV model developed in this paper presents dense ribs for wings and formers for fuselage, all of them manufactured by FDM technology. The study also includes a description of the 3D printing procedure of the components of the UAV model and the results of the flight tests. Following the flight tests, it can be said that the UAV model made by FDM technology is stable and has a wide airspeed range available, stall characteristics are good, and it operates with good aerodynamic characteristics and high maneuverability. Thus, the manufacturing technique presented in this paper can be used in the fast and efficient manufacture of scale aircraft prototypes with the purpose of determining the flight performance by conducting flight tests.",33,4
