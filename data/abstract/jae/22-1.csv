The surface of the Moon is exposed to the solar wind and solar UV radiation causing photoemission, so it develops a surface charge and an electric field near the surface. Dust particles injected into this plasma from the lunar regolith, whether from human and mechanical activity or from meteoroid impacts or electrostatic forces, may be stably levitated above the surface and may undergo preferential deposition onto areas of the lunar surface (or equipment) with different electrical properties. This can lead to a net transport as well as contamination of sensitive equipment. This paper reports on new experimental measurements and numerical simulations of the plasma environment above the lunar surface and the related behavior of charged dust.",22,1
1,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0893-1321(2009)22:1(10),"This paper presents a study of the angle of repose of a two-dimensional particle system under the Earth and Moon gravity fields. The particles interact with electrostatic forces in addition to friction. A two-dimensional discrete element method is used in this analysis with two particle shapes, circular and noncircular. The noncircular shape is constructed with overlapping pairs of disks. For the range of parameters studied, the angle of repose shows little sensitivity to gravity. The sensitivity to friction and electrostatic charges can be either significant or negligible, depending on the range of these values. For each contact friction, there is a threshold of electric charge on the particle such that the angle of repose suddenly drops to zero when the charge exceeds this threshold. The existence of this threshold, once validated in three-dimensional systems, may provide an opportunity to measure the electrostatic charges of the lunar dust in situ.",22,1

Given that detailed 3D grain-shape information is unavailable for real lunar soil, a simulant material, FJS-1, is used in this study. We use the high-resolution micro X-ray CT system at SPring-8, a synchrotron radiation facility in Japan, to visualize precise 3D images of the granular assembly of FJS-1. A newly developed image-analysis procedure is then applied to identify individual grains. Using the obtained grain-shape data, a sufficient number of FJS-1 grains are directly modeled for DEM simulation using an efficient modeling scheme. A series of particle flow simulations are then performed with the modeled grains. The resulting slope angles are in good agreement with experimental results. We discuss the effect on the slope angle of grain parameters such as contact stiffness, restitution coefficient, and interparticle friction.",22,1

This has identified the diffusion-driven flow in the bulk of the sand as an important but previously unrecognized mechanism for erosion dynamics. It has also shown that slow regime cratering is governed by the recirculation of sand in the widening geometry of the crater. Scaling relationships and erosion mechanisms have been characterized in detail for the slow regime. The diffusion-driven flow occurs in both slow and fast regime cratering. Because diffusion-driven flow had been omitted from the lunar erosion theory and from the pressure cratering theory of the Apollo and Viking era, those theories cannot be entirely correct.",22,1

A model is proposed that is based on the combined propagation of intergranular forces and an excess volume of voids. In this regard, it provides a bridge between earlier theories developed independently for the diffusion of stresses and for the propagation of settlements. In its general formulation, the theory can model three-dimensional, transient effects. However, the model is believed to be limited to normally consolidated or noncompacted, fully drained or dry, granular materials that do not exhibit dilatancy effects. The derived numerical modeling of steady state deflection patterns under a rigid footing is found to be in good agreement with x-ray images of laboratory model tests using noncompacted silt. The proposed theory recognizes the discrete and inherently random nature of natural granular materials such as cohesionless soils and builds upon these fundamental characteristics to predict responses of such materials to boundary applied load. This is achieved by modeling intergranular force and excess pore volume propagation as Markovian diffusion-advection processes. This approach, which departs from traditional continuum mechanics models, seems to have potential for addressing some of the challenging aspects of granular material mechanics in lunar or Martian environments.",22,1

Before any construction on the Moon can be envisaged, a proper understanding of soil properties and its mechanical behavior in these different environmental conditions is essential. This paper investigates the possible effect of surface-energy forces on the shear strength of lunar soil. All materials, with or without a net surface charge, exhibit surface-energy forces, which act at a very short range. Although, these forces are negligible for usual sand or silty sand on Earth, they may be important for surface activated particles under extremely low lunar atmospheric pressure. This paper describes a constitutive modeling method for granular material considering particle level interactions. Comparisons of numerical simulations and experimental results on Hostun sand show that the model can accurately reproduce the overall mechanical behavior of soils under terrestrial conditions. The model is then extended to include surface-energy forces between particles in order to describe the possible behavior of lunar soil under extremely low atmospheric pressure conditions. Under these conditions, the model shows that soil has an increase of shear strength due to the effect of surface-energy forces. The magnitude of increased shear strength is in reasonable agreement with the observations of lunar soil made on the Moon’s surface.",22,1

This simulant was produced by gabbro, which includes large quantity of feldspar (An>90). The simulant’s chemical composition, mineralogy, particle-size distribution, density, angle of internal friction, and cohesion have been analyzed and results demonstrated that most characteristics of NAO-1 are similar with lunar highland soil samples. NAO-1 will benefit the scientific and engineering research of lunar soil.",22,1

There are two takeoff styles: the vertical takeoff and the horizontal takeoff. Compared to the horizontal takeoff vehicle, the vertical takeoff reusable launch vehicle has advantages, such as a shorter down-range landing, a quicker recovery system (wherein takeoff and landing happen in approximately the same location), and a lighter weight. A vertical profile is used for vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) vehicles to achieve a recovery at the launch site. However, the first stage of the vertical takeoff reusable launch vehicle (RLV) typically can provide a very small or even zero velocity to its second or upper stage, if the upper stage is released at the peak altitude. Therefore, primarily, this type of launch vehicle is used to achieve hundreds of seconds in a microgravity environment. The upper stage payload delivery capabilities of a vertical takeoff RLV and its potential applications are described from a trajectory point of view. A modified optimal control methodology and an intuitive method of the trajectory control, called energy for altitude and time, are used to determine the maximum throw distance, maximum flight time, and orbital insertion capabilities for certain payloads, separately. The results from this investigation show the possibilities of expanding the applications for the VTVL suborbital RLV.",22,1

The supported point of this pendulum moves on an elliptic path with the rigid body suspended at the end point of the pendulum. Applying Lagrange’s equation, the equations of motion are obtained in terms of small parameter (ε). These equations represent a quasi-linear system of second order, which can be solved in terms of generalized coordinates Θ, Φ, and β using the method of small parameters. At the end, a discussion of the motion and a conclusion of the results are considered to show the orientation of the body and the geometric interpretation of this motion at any instant of time. Also, computerized data with graphical representations of the solutions are given for describing the behavior of the body in some periods of time.",22,1

The “safety culture” developed in aeronautics results in detailed regulations and certification procedures in all phases of aircraft design and operation. But despite that, aircraft safety depends on several unpredictable factors, such as the hostile actions both inside and outside of the aircraft. When failures occur during the flight, the most important actions are aimed at maintaining the aircraft controllability. The aircraft control system should be fault tolerant and ensure aircraft controllability in the event of the failure of a part of the flight control system. In this paper the influence of control surface failures on autopilot operation has been investigated. The autopilot is designed for business jet airplanes and fulfills the main functions of the real autopilot system in longitudinal and lateral directions. The autopilot structure allows implementation of various methods of reconfiguration for aircraft protection.",22,1

Fixed-pitch small-scale rotors, brushless motors, lithium-polymer cells, and embedded control are combined to produce a mechanically simple, high-performance thruster with potentially high reliability. The custom rotor design requires a balance between manufacturing simplicity and rigidity of a blade versus its aerodynamic performance. An iterative steady-state aeroelastic simulator is used for holistic blade design. The aerodynamic load disturbances of the rotor-motor system in normal conditions are experimentally characterized. The motors require fast dynamic response for authoritative vehicle flight control. We detail a dynamic compensator that achieves satisfactory closed-loop response time. The experimental rotor-motor plant displayed satisfactory thrust performance and dynamic response.",22,1

There are two key problems in setting up the statistical damage constitutive model of quasi-brittle materials, namely, determining the microunit strength and the parameters of statistical distribution that the microunit strength obeys. The four-parameter criterion is a failure criterion consisting of four unknown parameters. When the four parameters equal appropriate values, it may become the Drucker–Prager criterion (for rock), Mohr–Coulomb criterion (for rock), and Hsieh–Ting–Chen criterion (for concrete), so the four-parameter criterion may be used to simulate the elastoplastic behavior of rock and concrete quasi-brittle materials. In the paper, microunit strength is determined with the four-parameter criterion, thus the statistical damage constitutive model suits rock and concrete. The deficiencies of existing methods in determining the distribution parameters are investigated, and a new method for determining the distribution parameters is proposed. First, the theoretical relationships between the parameters and the strain and stress at the peak point of material failure curve are derived; second, the approximate relations between the strain and stress at the peak point of material failure curve and confining pressure are established through the curve fitting method; finally, the relations between the parameters and confining pressure are established. The proposed statistical damage softening constitutive model of quasi-brittle materials has universal meaning, the determination of distribution parameters has strict theoretical basis, and the distribution parameters can be conveniently obtained with general triaxial tests. Numerical examples are also presented to validate the model.",22,1
