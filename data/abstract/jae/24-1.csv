Some complex methods are highly accurate and require a lot of input data while others are fairly trivial and less accurate but require minimal input data. Projectile impact point predictors (IPPs) have three primary error sources: model error, parameter error, and initial state error. While model error typically shrinks as model complexity increases, parameter and initial state errors grow with increasing model complexity. Since all input data feeding an IPP are uncertain to some level, the ideal IPP for an overall situation is not clear cut by any means. This paper examines several different projectile IPPs that span the range of complex nonlinear rigid projectile models to simple vacuum point mass models with the intent to better understand relative merits of each algorithm in relation to the other algorithms and as a function of parameter uncertainty and initial state error. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to compute impact point statistics as a function of the range to the target for an indirect fire 155-mm spin stabilized round. For this specific scenario, results indicated neglecting physical phenomena in the formulation of the equations of motion can degrade impact point prediction, especially early in the flight. Adding uncertainty to the parameters and states induces impact point errors that dominate model error contributions. Impact point prediction errors scaled linearly with parameter and state errors. All IPPs investigated converged to the actual impact point as the time at which the estimate took place approached the time of impact.",24,1

This paper outlines the development of a prototype deployable astronomical telescope that would maintain both structural stability and optical alignment for potential space-based deployment. To achieve this goal, the structure must possess adequate stiffness and maintain its positional accuracy after a deployment cycle has ensued. The development and testing were based on a consumer-astronomy Newtonian telescope. A foldable carbon-epoxy composite replacement structure was integrated to replace the aluminum-truss assembly provided by the manufacturer. The composite telescope’s structure and optical output were evaluated using computational (finite-element analyses and closed-form equations) and experimental methods. The structure was subjected to postdeployment displacement tests to quantify alignment accuracy. The stresses introduced in folding the tape springs were evaluated for both magnitude and mode of failure using the Tsai-Wu failure criterion.",24,1

The first part of the study considers analytical solution for an optimal control policy of variable mass spacecraft, while it descents on the surface of the moon in the variable gravitational field of it. To validate the accuracy of perturbation solution, a numerical approach based on steepest descent method is employed. The second part considers analytical derivation of an optimal feedback guidance solution by employing the neighboring optimal control (NOC) law when effects of imperfection in the dynamic model or disturbing noises have been taken into account. The technique of NOC produces time-varying feedback gains that minimize the performance index to the second order for perturbations from a nominal optimal path. The robustness of the designed NOC law is examined with applying sinusoidal noises. From the study of the simulation results, it may be concluded that the developed optimal guidance laws may be used in real world spacecraft applications.",24,1

Also presented is a method for modeling the uncertainty in both the rocket dynamics and the atmospheric conditions using stochastic parameters and the Monte Carlo method. Included within this, we present a method for quantifying the uncertainty in the atmospheric conditions using historical atmospheric data. The core simulation algorithm is a numerical integration of the rocket’s equations of motion using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method. The position of the rocket’s center of mass is described using three dimensional Cartesian coordinates and the rocket’s orientation is described using quaternions. Input parameters to the simulator are made stochastic by adding Gaussian noise. In the case of atmospheric parameters, the variance of the noise is a function of altitude and noise at adjacent altitudes is correlated. The core simulation algorithm, with stochastic parameters, is run within a Monte Carlo wrapper to evaluate the overall uncertainty in the rocket’s flight path. The results of a demonstration of the simulator, where it was used to predict the flight of real rocket, show the rocket landing within the 1σ area predicted by the simulation. Also lateral acceleration during weather cocking, which was measured in the test, shows a strong correlation with simulated values.",24,1

Full-order observers, reduced-order observers, and UIOs are widely used in state estimations. After the estimation of states, fault detection can be provided by conducting residual analysis. Despite of the existence of unknown inputs, fault detection and isolation are implemented for a very large, four-engined, cargo jet aircraft model. Sensor accommodation is realized via switching under redundant sensor existence assumption. Actuator accommodation is provided by gain scheduling. Hence, if a fault occurs in an actuator corresponding to the control surfaces, the remainder (n−1) actuators are used to avoid hazardous flight. Sensor and actuator faults are detected by using residuals. Sensor faults are effective on the outputs, while actuator faults are effective on the state equations. Fault isolation is implemented by taking into account that each residual is sensitive to all of the other faults but one fault. Fault detection, isolation, and a recommended accommodation are shown through the simulations to be functional.",24,1

The main idea of this proposal is shaping small aircraft dynamic characteristics in a way that enables all general aviation aircraft to exhibit similar user-friendly properties from the pilot’s point of view. The natural solution of this problem is modifying aircraft dynamic properties to comply with the “ideal model” of a safe and easily controllable airplane. We can improve the handling qualities of an aircraft using the indirect flight control system. In this paper, the model following method was used for controller synthesis, with the purpose of obtaining qualitatively new handling properties and simplifying the control system for pilots with limited professional training. However, a control system designer has to assume responsibility for proper functioning of complex flight control systems. The properties of the optimal controller were calculated applying the indirect (implicit) model following method. In particular, the modified version based on the computer simulations was used. Model following method allows shaping properties of the flight control systems that satisfactorily approximate those of the desired model of controlled aircraft. In this way, the expected handling qualities can be reached.",24,1

Popular scenarios that envision covering modules with in situ regolith will necessitate means to excavate and move large amounts of material; will complicate evolutionary outpost growth; and may require long tunnels between connecting pressurized elements. Strategies that incorporate shielding materials into module structures or internal shelters add very substantial launch mass penalties. Utilization of water bladders can make efficient use of consumable/recyclable supplies, but may impose excess capacity deliveries at early development stages. This paper addresses these different shielding approaches from a top-level application perspective, highlighting pros and cons of each. Examples draw upon research and design investigations undertaken by the Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture in support of separate National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contracts awarded to teams headed by Boeing and ILC-Dover for a “Minimum Functionality Habitation Systems Concept Study.” Comprehensive team study results were presented to NASA in February 2009, and have been released as public information.",24,1

The conversion of conventional aircraft into more/all-electric one tends to be based on the installation of such innovative systems. A better understanding of problems related to fuel cells applied to aeronautics is sought by the European Commission funded project environmentally friendly intercity aircraft powered by fuel cells (ENFICA-FC). The main objective of the ENFICA-FC project is to develop and to validate the use of a fuel-cell based power system for propulsion of an all-electric aircraft. The fuel-cell system will be installed in a light sport aircraft (Rapid 200) that will be flown and performance tested as a proof of functionality and future applicability. Specific aspects have to be investigated in the onboard installation of the innovative system and new design indications have to be pointed out in order to fulfill the conversion. One of the key items under investigation is the simulation of existing cooling system and the evaluation of motor and fuel-cell temperature; the temperature has to be maintained within the limits established by manufacturers of critical systems during all likely operating conditions as indicated by aeronautic regulations for general aviation. The computational problem addressed in this paper is the numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the existing air-cooling system that satisfies air request for cooling and venting. An engineering model has been developed and it is used to support air inlet and outlet design. The flow is reasonably approximated by a potential flow plus boundary layer; hence, total upstream pressure losses are neglected except for those within the thin boundary layer. Pressure recovery of incoming cooling air and pressure coefficient distribution have been studied by using VSAERO panel code, and the optimal position of cooling and venting intakes is defined according to aerodynamic results. Propeller effects are included by referring to an optimal propeller specifically designed for the ENFICA-FC project. Propeller slip-stream wake is modeled by an actuator disk plus a swirl membrane and used to study the problem of motor, electronic, and fuel cells’ cooling during takeoff.",24,1

Each of these controllers is activated in a region of the interception. The distribution of the membership functions and the rules are obtained by solving a nonlinear constrained multiobjective optimization problem where final time, energy consumption, and miss distance are treated as competing objectives. A hierarchical clustering technique is implemented to provide the decision maker with a representative and manageable Pareto-optimal set without destroying the characteristics of the trade-off front. Moreover, a fuzzy-based mechanism is employed to extract the best compromise solution over the trade-off curve. The simulation results show that the proposed design technique was able to generate a missile guidance law which has better performance than the classical proportional guidance law.",24,1

Then a modified TurboEdit preprocessing method is proposed. In the modified method, a weighted factor which closely relates to the GPS satellite elevation angle is introduced in the cycle-slip detection process. The weighted factor estimates the error of measurement data based on the variation of GPS elevation angle and establishes a relationship between the cycle-slip detection process and error of measurement data. Then the cycle-slip detection judgment is adjusted by the weighted factor. The modification algorithm not only reduces the fault rate of cycle-slip detection, but also promotes the autonomous ability of orbit determination by increasing the quantity of measurement data that will participate in low-earth-orbit-satellite orbit determination. Finally, the modified algorithm is verified by GPS measurement data of GRACE satellite formation.",24,1

These structures (towers) can be used for the launching of spaceships, radio, television, and communication transmissions for tourism, scientific observation of the Earth’s surface, weather of the top atmosphere, and military radiolocation. The main idea and attribute of the invention is the following: The suspended structures (space station) are supported by a MAGNETIC column which has a mass (weight) close to zero. The writer estimates two projects of motionless magnetic space stations: one height is equal to 100 km and the second project up to 37,000 km (geosynchronous orbit). These projects are not expensive and do not require a high crane or complex technology. They do require a superconductive material and a thin strong film composed of artificial fibers. Both materials are fabricated by the current industry. The structures (space stations) can easily be built using present technology without rockets. The structure is built by unreeling a special roll. The structures (towers) can be used (for communication, tourism, etc.) during the construction process and provide self-financing for further construction. The building does not require work at high altitudes; all construction can be done on the Earth’s surface. The transport system (climber) consists of a very simple magnetic engine provided with electricity from a wire connecting the structure with the Earth. Problems involving security, control, repair, and stability of the proposed towers are shortly considered. The writer is prepared to discuss these and other problems with serious organizations desiring to research and develop this project. Magnetic towers may also become a civic symbol giving any city a distinctive landmark such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris or the Ostankino Tower (Russian: Останкинская телебашня, Ostankinskaya telebashnya) in Moscow.",24,1
11,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000059,"A fully nonlinear parametric model for wind-excited arch bridges is proposed to carry out the flutter analysis of Ponte della Musica under construction in Rome. Within the context of an exact kinematic formulation, all of the deformation modes are considered (extensional, shear, torsional, in-plane, and out-of-plane bending modes) both in the deck and supporting arches. The nonlinear equations of motion are obtained via a total Lagrangian formulation while linearly elastic constitutive equations are adopted for all structural members. The parametric nonlinear model is employed to investigate the bridge limit states appearing either as a divergence bifurcation (limit point obtained by path following the response under an increasing multiplier of the vertical accidental loads) or as a Hopf bifurcation of a suitable eigenvalue problem (where the bifurcation parameter is the wind speed). The eigenvalue problem ensues from the governing equations of motion linearized about the in-service prestressed bridge configuration under the dead loads and wind-induced forces. The latter are expressed in terms of the aeroelastic derivatives evaluated through wind-tunnel tests conducted on a sectional model of the bridge. The results of the aeroelastic analysis—flutter speed and critical flutter mode shape—show a high sensitivity of the flutter condition with respect to the level of prestress and the bridge structural damping.",24,1

The suggested design does not have the traditional current rails and sliding contacts. This accelerates the projectile and space apparatus by a magnetic column which can have a length of some kilometers, produces a very high acceleration and projectile (apparatus) final speed of up to 8–10 km/s. Important advantages of the offered design is the low (up to some thousands of times) used electric current of high voltage and very high efficiency coefficient close to 1 (compare with efficiency of the current railgun which equals 20–40%). The suggested accelerator may be produced by present technology. The projects: railgun and space accelerator are computed.",24,1

The constraints, switching conditions, and mechanical relations are analyzed. The bouncing dynamic model of the wind-driven spherical robot is established using the Kane’s method. The rolling, sliding, and floating dynamic models of the robot based on the Newton mechanics method are derived. Finally, we combine the dynamic models and analyze all the kinds of movements of the robots considering the effect of the stochastic wind in environment. The software platform of the movement analysis is developed, and the movement simulation of the robot is realized. The numerical simulation results reveal the effects of the environment and robot parameters on the movement performances of the robot.",24,1

The wing consists of a sandwich box substructure, flexible ribs, and a flexible laminated skin. The adaptation capability to the changing flight conditions is obtained via airfoil shape adjustments. Torsion SMA tubes are employed for wing camber control, while levers powered by SMA wires are employed for local shape control. A new architecture is proposed: the downward or upward actuation torque is provided by counterrotating concentric tubes connected through a clutch and a positioning piezoelectric motor to the flexible ribs. These actuator tubes are heated one at a time while the other is made free by the clutch in order to obtain any wanted shape without waiting for cooling. The capability of the wing to bear the aerodynamic loads, the power required by the actuators, and their force and torque are assessed by finite-element simulations. An improved version of a recently developed element is employed that accurately and efficiently captures stresses and deformations in the composite structure. The wing requires a peak power of 1,223 W that is compatible with the UAV considered here, i.e., with a maximum take-off weight of 1,000 kg and jet engine. It can smoothly deform with a camber mean rotation of 22° and rotation at the tip of 40° with a load factor of 5, a differential camber rotation of 10°, and a profile variation from 40 to 55% of the chord (4.5% increase and 3.9% decrease of thickness) at cruise speed.",24,1
