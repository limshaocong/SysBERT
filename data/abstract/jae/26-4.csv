Several comprehensive influencing factors, including nonlinear behavior of concrete, infinite foundation radiation damping, dam-reservoir dynamic interaction, and the contact nonlinearity of the transverse joints and the induced joints, are taken into account to study their effects on the seismic safety of high arch dams. In the paper, an analytical method is proposed to evaluate the ultimate anti-seismic capacity of high arch dams, and failure modes of the arch dam resulting from earthquakes with different levels are studied. The seismic limit state of the arch dam is determined according to distribution of the concrete’s failure zone, divergence of finite-element calculation, and mutation of the time-dependent displacement curves of key points on the dam. The revealed mechanism of dynamic catastrophic damage on high arch dams may serve as a scientific foundation for seismic safety evaluation and design of future high arch dams.",26,4

In this paper, a treatment method for an expansive soil channel slope with soilbags is proposed. The mechanism of the proposed treatment method is introduced. A number of the swell potential, swelling pressure, seepage, and interlayer friction tests were conducted on soilbags filled with expansive soils, which were taken from a construction site of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project in China. The test results indicate that soilbags can enhance the strength and restrict the swelling deformation of the expansive soil, and that the assembly of soilbags has a high permeability and interlayer friction coefficient. The stability of an expansive channel slope reinforced by soilbags is analyzed based on the limit-equilibrium theory.",26,4

A well-validated, three-dimensional hydrodynamic-water temperature model was established and applied to simulate the water temperature distribution in Xiangxi Bay (XXB), a representative tributary bay of the Three Gorges Reservoir in China. The numerical results show that temperature stratification with stable vertical temperature profiles seasonally occurred in XXB. Based on these findings, the effect of water temperature stratification on the vertical transport of suspended solids was discussed. Using theoretical derivation and analysis of the relationship between water temperature and the settling velocity of a single spherical solid particle, the settling velocity of suspended solids was significantly affected by temperature under weak turbulence. Therefore, the suspended solids tended to accumulate in the epilimnion or thermocline regions, which could result in the stratification of chlorophyll-a and some other parameters of water quality.",26,4

Persistent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) overcomes the decorrelation and atmospheric disturbances problem. The results obtained by PS-InSAR technique are not the field deformation information but persistent scatterers deformation. In this paper, PS-InSAR and geographic information system (GIS) are used to investigate surface deformation caused by groundwater overexploitation in Nantong, China. For improving the accuracy of extracting the atmospheric effects in the PS-InSAR technique, an automatic determining method of the best filter method and filter window size is proposed when extracting the atmospheric effects from the residual phase by filtering. The proposed method is based on structure function of residual phases. The linear deformation rate of permanent scatterers was analyzed by using ArcGIS tools to examine the distribution of data and detect outliers. The ground deformation rate was interpolated using kriging method, and a ground subsidence rate map with high resolution was developed. The experimental results show that the method can improve the accuracy of the extraction of atmospheric effects. A ground subsidence rate map of Nantong with high resolution was generated. The subsidence rate of most zones in Nantong is less than 8 mm/year, and the interpolation accuracy of subsidence rate can be improved by using the spatial analysis and interpolation tools of ArcGIS. Eight subsidence funnels are found in Nantong downtown during the period of 2006–2009; but there are no large subsidence funnels in Nantong downtown.",26,4

These phenomena considerably improve the properties of concrete. To comprehensively evaluate this technology, an extensive experimental program on evaluating the discharged water, moisture content, water-binder ratio variation during the casting process, and surface quality of specimens formed with the CPF liner and control formwork was conducted. Two types of CPF liners with different parameters in the vertical and horizontal permeability coefficients, weight, nominal thickness, and air permeability coefficient were considered. In addition, multiscale experimental characterization of concrete samples, including chloride ion permeability, abrasion resistance, ultrasonic test, scanning electron microscope, and mercury intrusion porosimetry, was performed. It demonstrated that the compactness, antipermeability, and rebound strength of specimens were increased effectively if the key parameters (e.g., permeability coefficients, weight, and thickness) of the CPF liner were properly chosen. Moreover, the fractal dimension of material porosity, which correlates to the cumulative volume of intruded mercury for the specimens, was computed, and it was capable of quantifying concrete surface densification and revealing the quality-improvement mechanism of concrete formed with the CPF liner.",26,4

The temperature and heat flux at the inner wall of the combustion chamber can be obtained using this method. The key parameters of the test article are presented, and the technique requirements for thermocouples are described. A two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric numerical calculation method was developed to obtain the wall temperature and heat flux from the measured temperatures. The method was applied to a firing test of a single-element gaseous hydrogen/gaseous oxygen shear-coaxial injector chamber to demonstrate the details of the method. Furthermore, the heat transfer characteristics of a single-element combustion chamber at chamber pressures of 0.92 MPa to 6.1 MPa were investigated using this method. The results indicate that the wall heat flux of this gas-gas injector combustor has, qualitatively, the same distribution at different pressures and correlates quantitatively with the chamber pressure as q˙∼pc0.8.",26,4

Understanding the applicability of the assumptions used in heat-transfer measurements and wall material-based flowfield analysis are the major objectives of the present studies. In view of this, a special CHT solver is developed for these investigations. This 2D-solver is based on explicit finite-volume formulation for fluid domain and implicit finite volume formulation for solid domain computations. The present numerical explorations are carried out using this in-house solver for various wall materials, different freestream Mach numbers, and freestream stagnation enthalpies of hypersonic flows over a finite thickness flat plate. Encouraging match has been observed between the results obtained from the CHT solver for very high thermal conductivity wall case and present fluid flow solver for isothermal flat plate case. Viability of assumptions used for post-processing the experimental data has also been proved. These results provide the evidence of usefulness of CHT studies for hypersonic applications.",26,4

First, the dynamic mathematic model of gas flow–regulating system considering friction is established and analyzed. Then, the mechanism of friction-compensation method based on additional dither signal is proposed, and the compensation loop with adaptive-amplitude dither signal is added to the original system to overcome the effect of the varied friction. The simulation results show the validation of the adaptive dither signal in solving the problems caused by the variable friction in gas-regulation system of ducted rockets.",26,4

Based on the complex nonlinear dynamics in the considered vehicles, a control-oriented model, which can retain the dominant features of the higher-fidelity model, is adopted for the control design. First, the T-S fuzzy approach is utilized to model the nonlinear dynamic of flexible air-breathing hypersonic vehicles, and the input nonlinearity model, which comprises dead-zones, sector nonlinearities, and actuator saturation, is considered. Then, based on the constructed T-S fuzzy model, a novel fuzzy integral sliding mode control method is proposed. This method can eliminate the reaching phase of the traditional sliding mode control by designing a novel sliding surface. Moreover, by the parallel-distributed compensation scheme, a sufficient condition is established to guarantee the global robust stability of the sliding mode dynamics in the specified surface in the presence of unmatched uncertainties and disturbance. The reachability of the specified sliding surface is guaranteed by an adaptive sliding mode controller under input nonlinearity. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.",26,4

The approximator is composed of a linear combination of a parameter and a basis function. Instead of using neural networks as a function approximator, the new approach utilizes a Chebyshev polynomial as a basis function for function approximation, and a parameter update law is derived via a Lyapunov-like analysis method. The benefits of the proposed method are twofold. First, the computational time is approximately 1.7 times faster than that of the method using the neural network. Second, the implementation is very efficient, because the structure of the approximator is significantly simpler in comparison with those of neural network approaches. Because the complexity of the software is the major contributing factor to software reliability, the high complexity of the implementation of a control algorithm that adopts neural networks could lead to a reduction in software reliability. Therefore, the new adaptive control method is valuable in terms of the improvement in software reliability. In particular, it is important in the field of aerospace control, which requires exceptional reliability for flight control software. Moreover, the short computational time in comparison with neural network approaches is very crucial for small unmanned aerial vehicles that have restricted on-board hardware performance. From simulation results, it is found that the performance of the proposed method in several responses is on par with that of the neural network method in the presence of varying flight conditions. Considering the computation time and simplicity of the proposed method, the authors conclude that the proposed approach is very effective, particularly relative to the neural network method.",26,4

The PISMC includes the advantages of both conventional sliding mode control (SMC) and integral sliding mode control (ISMC). The proposed PISMC algorithm is capable of stabilized attitude and position control for unmanned helicopter autonomous hovering, and it offers a performance improvement over the conventional SMC and ISMC algorithms as well. The system performance is quantified and an experimental unmanned helicopter system is developed to access the performance of the PISMC. Both simulations and actual flight tests are conducted to verify the PISMC attitude and position control. The simulation results show that the PISMC tracking error is smaller and that PISMC converges faster than SMC does. The flight test results prove that the proposed PISMC is effective in the attitude and position control of unmanned helicopter autonomous hovering.",26,4
11,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000204,"Attitude estimation is an important issue in the autonomous flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system. However, for a micro-sized UAV with a wingspan of less than 2 m, a high performance Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) is usually too heavy and large, whereas a low-cost AHRS of suitable size and weight may easily give erroneous attitude data. In this study, a single-antenna global positioning system (GPS)–based attitude estimation method, called pseudoattitude, in combination with the angular rate data given by the onboard gyroscopes, is applied to solve the problem. That is, the pseudoattitude estimated by the GPS velocity data provides a reference attitude with some time lag, whereas the gyroscope’s angular rate is integrated with the aid of a proposed complementary filter to eliminate the time lag problem. An experimental method is then developed to determine the filter parameters by a static ground test of the GPS and flight test data with postprocessing and analysis. A fuzzy logic attitude controller is designed for the experimental verification of the attitude estimation. Results indicate that the attitude estimation is successfully obtained and used as the primary attitude source to stably control the UAV in this study. During the flight tests, two sets of desired attitude conditions (desired roll: 0°, desired pitch: 0° and desired roll: −25°, desired pitch: 3°) are set for the aircraft, and it is capable of maintaining the desired attitude conditions with sufficient performance for low-cost UAV applications.",26,4

In this method, the interception problem is defined as an optimal control problem by full dynamics of the interceptor and the current position and velocity of the target in the three-dimensional space. By solving the interception optimal control problem for various objective and constraint functions, integrated guidance and control commands are generated online during interception. To find the closed-loop and state-dependent solution, the interception optimal control problem is defined in a receding horizon control framework. To quickly solve the interception problem, the direct trajectory optimization method, which is a combination of a differential flatness concept, b-spline curves, and nonlinear programming, is used. To demonstrate the implementation of the proposed method, a numerical example of interception of a maneuvering target by a missile is presented. The proposed optimal guidance method can be applied for integrated guidance and nonlinear control of the interceptors in various interception problems in aerospace engineering and robotics.",26,4

Two automatic landing systems (ALSs) are designed. The former uses an instrument landing system (ILS), whereas the latter controls flight altitude using the state vector. Both systems have a subsystem for the control of longitudinal velocity that is based on the dynamic inversion theory. The subsystems for pitch-angle control use proportional-derivative (PD) control laws or a law based on the dynamic inversion theory and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The slope and flare controllers are a PD controller and a PID controller, respectively. The controllers are designed in both classical and fuzzy-logic approaches. Theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations in the absence or presence of wind shear and sensor errors. Analysis of the time evolution of the main ALS parameter leads to conclusions regarding the superiority of the dynamic qualities for the ALS with fuzzy controllers.",26,4

A simple approach is developed for synchronizing the motion of these slave gyroscopes whose individual motion may be regular or chaotic, with the motion of an independent master gyroscope irrespective of the chaotic or regular motion exhibited by the master. The problem of synchronization of these multiple gyroscopes is approached from a constrained motion perspective through the application of the fundamental equation of mechanics. The approach yields explicit, closed-form expressions for the control torques that are required to be applied to each of the coupled slave gyroscopes to achieve exact synchronization with the master’s motion. The influence of different types of interactions between the slave gyroscopes is investigated with an incidence matrix that describes the coupling between any two of them. The effect of the so-called sleeping condition on the synchronization of the gyroscopes is also explored. To illustrate the efficacy of the methods presented in this paper, we consider numerical examples involving systems of multiple gyroscopes and synchronize them with the motion of a master gyroscope.",26,4

The governing system of partial differential equations is first transformed into ordinary differential equations and solved numerically using an implicit finite-difference scheme known as the Keller-box method. The effects of the magnetic parameter M, the velocity exponent parameter m, and the stretching/shrinking parameter ε on the flow field are discussed. It is found that the magnitude of the skin friction coefficient |f″(0)| increases with both the magnetic parameter M and the velocity exponent parameter m, when the stretching velocity differs from the free-stream velocity (ε≠1), and is zero when ε=1. For a fixed value of the magnetic parameter M, a unique or dual solutions are found for the shrinking sheet, depending on the values of the parameters m and ε.",26,4

17,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000184,"The strain energy updating technique (SEUPT) is extended to a new zigzag shell model with a hierarchical piecewise representation of displacements, which can adapt to a variation of solutions across the thickness. This model has the capability of being refined across the thickness without increasing the number of functional degrees of freedom (DOF) (the traditional midplane displacements and shear rotations). The purpose of the SEUPT is to improve the accuracy of standard finite elements based on equivalent single-layer models with transverse shear deformations up to the level of the zigzag model. The strain and kinetic energies and the work of external forces are updated through a postprocessing iterative procedure by starting from a local interpolation of the results of the finite-element analysis. Because no derivatives of in-plane stresses are involved, updating is fast. The current version of the SEUPT obtains accurate predictions of interlaminar stresses from constitutive equations; thus, it does not require integration of local differential equilibriums, which is unwise for finite elements and can be inaccurate in certain cases. Because of its adaptive capability, the SEUPT efficiently treats thick laminated plates and shells with distinctly different properties of layers, strong anisotropy, and significant transverse normal stresses and strains. Accuracy is assessed by considering the stresses under static loading and the response to blast pulse loading of undamaged and damaged sandwich shells with laminated faces. The results show that the SEUPT preserves the accuracy of the zigzag shell model and efficiently improves the accuracy of standard finite elements.",26,4

This paper presents results from the static, frequency, and dynamic impact analysis of the structure using a nonlinear (large deformation) finite-element technique. The results are presented, taking into account the effects of the added mass of the regolith and stress stiffening because of the applied internal pressurization load. The impact loading is analytically derived by considering the impact of a moving object/debris/projectile hitting the midpoint of one of the frame members at the crest of the structure. For the frequency analysis, the results show that both pressurization and added regolith mass affect the frequency and mode-shape characteristics, where the effects of the added mass of the regolith are observed to be substantially larger than the effects of pressurization. For the static and dynamic analyses, the midspan impact results show that both pressurization and added regolith mass affect the displacement and stress of the structure. The internal pressurization (prestressing) causes the structure to statically expand and stresses it, but has little effect on the dynamic amplitude of the oscillation of the displacement and stress. The added mass of the regolith also influences the static displacement and stress by slightly contracting and stressing the structure. However, it has a much larger impact on the transient analysis, reducing the oscillation amplitude and increasing the period.",26,4

Microwave heating may serve many lunar applications including heating the regolith for lunar surface dust stabilization, oxygen production, building materials, and mineral refinement. The dielectric properties (dielectric constant, ε′, and loss factor, ε″) of the lunar simulant, JSC-1AC, were measured at 2.45 GHz microwave frequency from room temperature to 1,100°C. The dielectric loss tangent and half-power depth were calculated from the measured properties. The loss tangent increased from a low value of 0.02 at room temperature to a high value of 0.31 at 1,100°C, indicating increased efficiency of microwave absorption at higher temperatures. The low temperature loss tangent indicated that relatively slow, low efficiency heating would be expected at room temperature. The microwave heating experiments confirmed weak heating related to absorption below 250°C, and increasingly strong absorption above 250°C, leading to rapid heating and melting or the so-called thermal runaway of JSC-1AC. Heating with microwaves as the only energy source produced a thermal runaway with wide variations in the JSC-1AC, such as fully molten glass, with unsintered loose particulate located millimeters away. The addition of a supplemental radiant heat source to the microwave mitigated the thermal runaway effect and produced uniform solid materials from the JSC-1A lunar simulant. The room temperature dielectric properties of JSC-1AC were measured and found to be comparable with the range of published lunar regolith properties, making JSC-1AC a reasonable starting point for microwave heating and computational modeling studies.",26,4

To develop an effective way to measure the cohesion parameter, a new method was adopted and demonstrated. As the value of the critical height of a vertical cut is proportional to the cohesion of a soil, the cohesion of JSC-1A simulant was obtained through simple calculations based on the critical height measured. Footprint demonstrations were also used to illustrate the existence of cohesion in JSC-1A simulant, in a comparison with the photograph of footprints of astronauts on the Moon. A group of critical height tests was conducted to obtain the cohesion of lunar simulant JSC-1A for a range of densities from 1.61 to 1.96 g/cm3. It was found that the cohesion of JSC-1A simulant varies in the range from 0.0 to 1.1 kPa, in an approximately linear relationship with the soil density.",26,4

The work uses the frequency response of a linear system and a Duffing oscillator simulating hardening and softening springs. The skewness-kurtosis descriptor was observed to be efficiently calibrating the nature of the system and the extent of damping with robustness against the measurement noise and sampling effects. The descriptors allow rapid computation and can be applied to experimental data without the requirement of assuming a specific underlying model. The findings are general and applicable to a very broad spectrum of linear and nonlinear systems and applications.",26,4
