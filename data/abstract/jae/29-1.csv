In the proposed navigation system, one inertial navigation system (INS) is employed to continuously estimate the position and attitude of vehicle, and three X-ray sensors observing X-ray pulsars are utilized to reduce the long-term effects of the errors in the INS. In addition, a modified square-root unscented Kalman filter (MSUKF) is proposed. The MSUKF adopts a fading factor to compensate the impact of modeling error, and contains no linearization steps. The results have shown that the proposed navigation system outperforms the traditional celestial–inertial method and the MSUKF could guarantee a faster convergence compared with former proposed nonlinear filters.",29,1

Because of the importance of the weighting matrices in the design of the time-varying controller, based on a genetic algorithm and the sequential quadratic programming method, two optimization models (for time-invariant and piecewise-constant weighting matrices) are used to determine the weighting matrices to improve the performance of the time-varying optimal controller. Practical missions are presented for a spacecraft moving steadily on a reference orbit. Numerical simulations of these missions demonstrate that the parameter-optimization methods provide a smaller overshoot and faster convergence time than when trial-and-error or Bryson’s rule are used to select the weighting matrices. Piecewise-constant weighting matrices calculated for the time-varying controller using the parameter-optimization method provide better control performance than time-invariant weighting matrices. Additionally, for both optimization models, the genetic algorithm combined with sequential quadratic programming produces a shorter injection period and lower fuel consumption than the other optimization methods that are compared in this paper.",29,1

Analysis is performed in the presence of thermal radiation. Variable temperature and concentration are assumed at the surface of cylinder. The arising governing equations of momentum, energy, and concentration are transformed into nonlinear ordinary differential equations by appropriate transformations. Convergent solutions of the governing equations are found. The behavior of pertinent parameters on the velocity, temperature, and concentration profiles are depicted graphically and analyzed comprehensively in detail. The presented results are also compared with the previous published work in the limiting sense.",29,1

The algorithm is applicable to any unpowered lift-enabled vehicle (glider) traveling in planetary atmospheres, locally determining the shortest path to the target point. The guidance commands are chosen taking into account the drag and lift coefficients of the glider, with a parameterization based on wind tunnel data. As a proof of concept, the new algorithm has been applied to the guidance of the Space Shuttle during its return flight to Earth. Numerical simulations over a wide range of parameter values have shown that the algorithm is resilient to changes in both the initial conditions and the atmospheric conditions. For a typical gliding flight in the Earth’s atmosphere, from an altitude of 30 km down to 3 km, the margin of error for reaching the target ranges from 20 to 80 m.",29,1

However, the flow mechanism(s) responsible for these benefits is currently unknown, and several possibilities have been proposed. These include compartmentalization, vortex lift, varying effective angle of attack, and boundary layer momentum exchange. Currently, it is only known that tubercles create pairs of streamwise, counter-rotating vortices. By determining how tubercles work, the effects of their addition to untested foils in untested conditions can be hypothesized. This paper reviews the current status of the field of tubercles, comparing hypotheses with published results. The effects of tubercles on the principal components of drag are conjectured from consideration of similar flow control devices. Current applications of tubercles are detailed, and potential applications are suggested.",29,1

ESTCube-1 is a one-unit CubeSat built by students and launched on May 7, 2013, to a Sun-synchronous, 700-km, polar low Earth orbit. Its primary mission is to centrifugally deploy a tether as a part of the first in-orbit demonstration of electric solar wind sail (i.e., E-sail) technology. The ADS uses magnetometers, gyroscopic sensors, Sun sensors, and an unscented Kalman filter for attitude determination. Here the performance of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors and results from tuning the system is shared; recalibration, software, and Kalman filter adjustments. The system is validated by comparing the attitude determined by the on-board ADS with the attitude determined from on-board camera images. Uncertainty budgets for both attitude determination methods are estimated. The expanded uncertainty of comparison (95% confidence level, k=2) is 1.75° and the maximum difference between attitudes determined by both methods is 1.43°.",29,1

The ACHEON system is presently being proposed for propelling a new vertical and short takeoff (V/STOL) airplane in the European Union. This system is powered by two axial electric turbofans and uses the Coanda effect (attachment of the jet to a curved surface) to achieve precise control of the thrust angle. The present study investigates the thrust vectoring efficiency of this newly patented nozzle and its integration with UAV aircraft. This study numerically investigates the 3D effects on this new machine and proposes remedies to solve the associated problems. Further, swirling effects generated by electric turbofans were studied in great detail. The effect of uniform and nonuniform velocity profiles were investigated on thrust vectoring efficiency of the nozzle. Then, the aerodynamic features of prototype UAVs were determined under various flow conditions. The interaction of the exit nozzle flow with incoming airstream was studied. Computational fluid dynamics (CF) calculations were carried out using Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. A numerical method based on finite volume formulation (FVM) was used. Turbulent flow is modeled by using the SST k–ω model. Numerical results show that the presence of swirling velocities in the flow field significantly affects the thrust vectoring efficiency of the nozzle. From numerical simulations of the aircraft, it was found that the aerodynamic characteristics are strongly affected by the exit air jet angle.",29,1

Satellite operations can be divided into three phases: initial phase, operational or nominal phase, and disposal. All the tasks of these phases might be handled onboard, using a specified level of autonomy. On the other hand, a combination of onboard management and ground station (GS) telecommands can be used to perform the mentioned tasks. In the present work, a mission operation plan has been developed for a remote sensing low earth orbit (LEO) microsatellite using the semiautomated method, covering all operational phases of the satellite. The proper level of in-orbit autonomy enables the satellite to perform mission-specified tasks when out of ground station coverage. Additionally, microsatellite operational architecture for all in-orbit phases is presented. A basic timetable of the onboard control procedure is described, representing the satellite mission tasks and their corresponding sequence, and the microsatellite contingency plan with regard to mission priorities and electrical power constraints is explained.",29,1

The vehicle is modeled as a nonlinear time-varying system, with a slowly varying parameter (Mach number). First, a new stabilizing control law, based on finding a slowly varying control Lyapunov function (SVCLF), is developed for nonlinear multiple input time-varying systems with slowly varying parameters. In this regard, a theorem is proved, which shows that the proposed control law guaranties the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop nonlinear slowly varying system. This technique is then applied to nonlinear autopilot design for an air vehicle. The efficiency of the designed autopilot is compared with a numerical method, which is called receding horizon generalization of pointwise min–norm controller.

The spacecraft, equipped with four solar plates, is assumed to be orbiting in an elliptic orbit. The nonlinear spacecraft model includes uncertain parameters and external-disturbance moments. The objective is to control the roll-, pitch-, and yaw-angle trajectories of the spacecraft along prescribed reference trajectories using the solar plates. A higher-order sliding-mode control system is designed which consists of (1) a nominal nonlinear finite-time-stabilizing control law designed based on the notion of geometric homogeneity, and (2) a discontinuous sliding-mode control law to attenuate the effect of uncertainties in the model. For the synthesis of this control system, the attitude-angle errors and their first two derivatives are used. It is shown that in the closed-loop system, the attitude error as well as its first and second derivatives converge to the origin in a finite time. Then a high-gain observer is designed to estimate the first and second derivatives of the attitude-tracking error for synthesis, using only attitude-angle measurement. The closed-loop system including the observer achieves a fast recovery of the performance of the state-feedback higher-order sliding-mode control system. Simulation results are presented which show precise attitude control of the satellite, despite uncertainties in the model, using state variable as well as output feedback.",29,1

In this study, the effect of inserting an inner plate and its positioning on the resistance of sandwich structure against bird strike is investigated by means of a finite-element code. Experimental results have been used for validation of the numerical model. Aluminum alloy 2024 and aluminum AlSi7Mg0.5 foams with different densities were used for the face sheets and the inner plate and foam cores, respectively. It was seen that in the cases with an inner plate, the optimum inner plate position is when it is inserted at the middle of the foam. This case improves the resistance of the sandwich structure with respect to the case with no inner plate. The inner plate is also very helpful when the densities of the foam cores are different at the two sides of inner plate, especially when the top foam core is low density and the bottom foam core is high density. This is due to the fact that the inner plate spreads the impact energy to a very large area of the bottom dense foam core, and therefore decreases the final deflection of the bottom face sheet to a great extent.",29,1

To investigate the impact vibration, a model composed of springs and a cantilever beam carrying a mass is developed to simulate the shrouded turbine blade in aero-engines. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is used in deriving the equation of motion and the associated boundary conditions. Employing the Galerkin method, an approximate solution is obtained by using the Fourier series method. Explicit expressions are obtained to calculate the responses and the mode shapes. Based on the expressions, parametric analysis is performed to study the effect of the stiffness ratio, the mass ratio and the gas amplitude of the excitation force on the steady-state responses of the system. The research work offers a calculating method for the quantitative optimization. Two types of the impact vibration that occur in the system are studied: the 1-side impact where only one side of the shroud collides with another shroud, and the 2-side impact where both sides of the shroud collide with the adjacent shrouds. Comparisons between the two types of the impact vibration show that the amplitude of the 1-side impact is larger than that of the 2-side impact while the resonance frequency of the 1-side impact is smaller.",29,1

In this study, the aerodynamic performance of compound wings in ground effect was numerically investigated through a parametric design study. The compound wing is divided into three parts with one rectangular wing in the middle and two reverse taper wings with an anhedral angle at the sides. A NACA6409 airfoil was employed as a section of the wing. The design parameters included the span size, anhedral angle, and taper ratio plus two boundary conditions: ground clearance and Reynolds number. The three-dimensional, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were solved numerically. A realizable k−ε turbulent model was used to compute the effects of the turbulent flow over the wing surface. The computational results of the basic wing were compared with the experimental data of other published works. Next, the aerodynamic performance of the compound wings was computed for various design parameters. Accordingly, all design parameters had effects on the lift-to-drag ratio of the compound wing, although their effects were not equal. The span size of the side wing, anhedral angle, and ground clearance have substantial effects on the lift-to-drag ratio of the compound wing. Two phenomena, namely the ram effect pressure and tip vortex could affect the lift-to-drag ratio of the compound wing in different configurations and conditions.",29,1

This configuration is potentially the most influential parameter for the performance and stability of the wing-in-ground effect craft. As a continuation to the authors’ previous works, in this research, the aerodynamic coefficients of the compound wing have been numerically investigated through the design parametric study in ground effect. The aerodynamics performances of the compound wing have been computed and the effects of various design parameters on the lift-to-drag ratio have been discussed in the previous paper. First, this paper validates the prediction method by comparing the lift coefficient of a rectangular wing with NACA 6409 airfoil for different angles of attack with an aspect ratio of 1.25 and ground clearance of 0.15. Then, the aerodynamic coefficients of the compound wing are computed over a range of various design parameters. As expected, all design parameters have effects on the aerodynamic coefficients. However, the effects of design parameters on the aerodynamic behavior of the compound wing are not equal. It was found that the span of the side wing, anhedral angle, and ground clearance have considerable effects on the ram effect pressure and the tip vortex of the compound wing.",29,1

Firstly, by using the relative direction cosine matrix, the two-body nonlinear relative motion equations with a continuous radial acceleration on the chaser are obtained in the target’s local-vertical-local-horizontal frame. Secondly, considering that the relative range is small, a dimension of the system is weakly controllable by analyzing the controllability of the system, and then the problem is simplified into a two-dimensional optimal control problem with integral and terminal constraints. Thirdly, the optimal control problem is transformed into a two-point boundary value problem by using the Pontryagin’s minimum principle. Then a proper form of the generating function is proposed, and the differential equations associated with initial conditions are derived.

A high alternating current (ac) voltage is applied between parallel screen electrodes mounted at the end of the sampling tube. Regolith particles on the surface of the Moon and Mars are captured using an electrostatic force, and they are passed through the openings of the screen electrodes. The captured particles are then transported through a tube to a capsule against gravity utilizing mechanical vibration. Experiments demonstrated that regolith is captured for a short time period if the open end of the sampling tube is immersed in the regolith layer. The captured regolith is transported upward through the inclined sampling tube against gravity. However, if the regolith in the vicinity of the fixed tube is depleted, the transport rate is decreased. The regolith particles are captured by the alternative electrostatic force.
