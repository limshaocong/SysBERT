The adaptive critics design consists of actor and critic networks. The actor (control input) and critic (cost-to-go) network are trained off-line with respect to various initial states and final times within a finite step. Using the well-trained actor-critic, the near-optimal feedback control solution can be obtained online. In the process of applying SVM to the adaptive critics, an adequate kernel function and parameters depending on the kernel function must be selected. In this study, a polynomial function and radial basis function are used for the SVM kernel function to implement the algorithm. A minimum control effort problem with final constraints for spacecraft rendezvous is considered to demonstrate the performance of the proposed the developed algorithm with respect to each kernel function and to show its potential for designing an optimal controller.",32,1

In this paper, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging for characterizing subsurface moisture content and distribution is proposed, using a concrete panel specimen as an example. A 0.3×0.3×0.05-m concrete panel specimen cast and conditioned in laboratory was air-dried for almost 5 months and simultaneously monitored for its moisture variation by SAR imaging. From the analysis of its SAR images at different moisture contents, it was found that SAR images can not only qualitatively capture the moisture distribution inside concrete but can also quantitatively correlate with the overall moisture content inside concrete. Higher SAR amplitudes indicate stronger electromagnetic scattering response, suggesting greater values of dielectric constant. A critical contour in SAR images is proposed as an insightful measure for the subsurface sensing of concrete. An approach for determining the critical contour in each SAR image is proposed.",32,1

An in-depth study of the dynamic performance of the bridge due to dynamic vehicle loading is performed by field testing and a numerical method. The dynamic performance of the reinforced bridge is more typical and representative than that of new bridges without damage experience. Dynamic field testing is conducted, and the measured data are obtained after strengthening construction for the bridge. The modal parameters and dynamic impact factors are identified, and the proposed three-dimensional vehicle and bridge coupled vibration (VBCV) analysis model is validated based on the experimental results. The influence of vehicular speed, lane position, vehicle weight, road surface condition (RSC), and local damage on the dynamic performance for the bridge due to moving vehicles is studied comprehensively. It is found that the existing design code underestimates the dynamic impact for this bridge. The obvious difference between global and local dynamic amplification effects for the bridge induced by vehicles needs to be given more attention. The dynamic performance of the bridge is not improved distinctly after conventional reinforcement, and some innovative strengthening methods which can improve structural dynamic performance when subject moving vehicles need to be further researched.",32,1

However, the study of multiple rows of pile barriers in saturated soil is rare, especially of periodic pipe pile barriers in saturated soil. Based on a new method called the COMSOL partial differential equation (PDE) method, this paper investigates the vibration isolation of plane waves by periodic pipe pile barriers in saturated soil. First, through some comparisons with results from related works, the COMSOL PDE method is validated. Second, the first complete attenuation zone (CAZ) of pipe piles embedded periodically in saturated soil is studied; the effects of parameters such as the filling fraction, arrangement configuration, and filling materials on the first CAZ are discussed. Two kinds of formation mechanism of the first CAZ for periodic filled pipe pile barriers, the Bragg scattering mode and the locally resonant mode, are investigated comprehensively. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) models with multiple rows of periodic pipe piles in saturated soil are built, and the displacement responses behind the pile barriers are analyzed in the frequency domain. This study provides a sound background for the application of periodic pipe pile barriers in saturated soil to isolate ambient vibration in engineering practice.",32,1

In this study, an active sensing approach integrated with piezoceramic-based transducers called smart aggregates (SAs) was experimentally investigated to estimate the strength development of the entire early-age (0th h to 28th day) concrete in real time. A pair of SAs was embedded in a reinforced concrete specimen prior to casting. During the 28 days of the curing period, one SA was employed as an actuator to periodically generate a designed stress wave that propagated along the specimen; meanwhile, the other SA was applied as a sensor to detect stress waves. The wave responses of the SA sensor were recorded and analyzed during the 28-day testing period. The experimental results demonstrate that the magnitude of the detected stress wave in the concrete increased with the strength of the concrete in the 28-day curing period. In addition, a hydration monitoring index was established and compared to the previous results of the 28-day concrete strength curve obtained by standard compressive tests. The proposed hydration monitoring index and the 28-day concrete strength curve show similar trends, which indicates that the proposed method has the potential to estimate early-age concrete strength in real time.",32,1

Monitoring fatigue crack activity between physical inspections can provide far greater reliability in structural performance and can be used to prevent excessive damage and repair costs. In this paper, a thin-film strain sensor, called a soft elastomeric capacitor (SEC) sensor, is evaluated for sensing and monitoring fatigue cracks in steel bridges. The SEC is a flexible and mechanically robust strain sensor, capable of monitoring strain over large structural surfaces. By deploying multiple SECs in the form of dense sensor arrays, it is possible to detect fatigue cracks over large regions of a structural member such as a bridge girder. Previous studies have verified the SEC’s capability to monitor fatigue cracks under idealized harmonic load cycles with a constant crack propagation rate. Here, an investigation is performed under more complex and realistic situations to translate the SEC technology from laboratory testing to field applications—specifically, as cracking propagates under (1) a decreasing crack propagation rate, and (2) random traffic load cycles with stochastic peak-to-peak amplitudes and periods. An experimental program was developed which included an efficient data collection strategy, new loading protocols, and crack-sensing algorithms. The experimental results showed an increasing trend of the fatigue damage feature, crack growth index (CGI), under crack initiation and propagation, despite decreasing crack propagation rates or random traffic load cycles. In addition, the results also showed that the SEC did not produce false-positive results when cracks stopped growing. The findings of this study significantly enhance the SEC’s fatigue sensing and monitoring capability under more realistic loading conditions, which is a critical step toward field applications of this technology.",32,1

In most studies, due to the compliant equation, the compliant control scheme is not effective enough to perform all kinds of the manipulation missions in the postcapture phase. In this paper, a constrained compliant control scheme is proposed for safe manipulation of a postcapturing uncertain target with space robotic system. In order to manipulate the target safely and effectively, a compliant reference trajectory of the desired trajectory is generated considering the constraints of the contact force and torque. By constructing a Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) based constrained tracking controller, the control performance is designed in advance, and the constraints are preserved during the whole procedure. Finally, the simulations of stabilizing an uncertain tumbling target in the postcapture phase are designed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. With the comparisons to the general compliant control schemes, the safety and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme are validated via digital simulations.",32,1
7,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000949,"This paper investigates the energy-dependent mission planning of an agile earth observation satellite. According to the similarities between energy-dependent mission planning and the dynamic traveling salesman problem (DTSP), the energy-dependent mission planning is converted into a DTSP through two mappings from observation angle and energy to city and distance. In addition, to eliminate the uncertainty of feasible attitude trajectories/energy for a given scheduling strategy, a multiple-stage optimal energy factor is developed for the model extension. The paper further uses the time-optimal minΔTtransi−1,i in the transition time constraint as an input of the model to enlarge the optional execution time for the subsequent target in a consecutive observation. To solve this problem, a hybrid method integrating the Gauss pseudospectral method and the genetic algorithm (GPM-GA) is proposed which uses the genetic algorithm to generate the feasible solutions for scheduling process, whereas the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) is used to optimize the energy and the transition time constraint parameter for each solution. Extensive simulation results show that, compared with the classical genetic algorithm (CGA), the energy consumption and simulation time of the proposed algorithm are decreased effectively. In particular, the simulation time decreases more obviously with larger target sizes. Furthermore, attitude trajectory projections of satellite motion provided by GPM-GA are much smoother. These numerical and visualization results demonstrate the superiority of GPM-GA in terms of energy efficiency, computational efficiency, and attitude trajectory smoothing.",32,1

It is a nonlinear time domain system identification procedure and structures are represented by finite elements. The excitation time history may not be available soon after an earthquake and is not required to implement the procedure. The response time histories measured at a small part of a large structure, denoted as a substructure, can be noise-contaminated. The location and severity of defects in an element are evaluated by comparing its stiffness parameter with the previous value or deviation from the other similar members. The basic unscented Kalman filter concept available in the literature is significantly improved, increasing its implementation potential. The improved concept is developed by integrating the iterative least-squares, weighted global iteration, and objective function algorithms. The proposed concept is verified by assessing the health of large three-dimensional structures excited by earthquake time histories. The procedure is capable of identifying defects with different levels of severity in small or large civil structures. This study also indicates that the inspection outcomes are not sensitive to the location and configuration of the substructure. The capability and efficiency of the procedure are demonstrated with three informative examples.",32,1

The aerodynamic forces and flow field around the wings vary dramatically with the unsteady motion parameters (reduced frequency, mean angle of attack, and amplitude). This study conducts numerical simulations to investigate the influence of such parameters on the aerodynamic characteristics of a pitching NACA 0012 airfoil. The respective cases are researched through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the finite-volume method (FVM). The governing equations are the unsteady, incompressible two-dimensional Navier–Stokes (N-S) equations. The airfoil performs sinusoidal pitching oscillations with respect to the quarter chord at the Reynolds number 2.53×105. A detailed analysis of the force coefficients and how their evolution is affected by the dynamics of flow structures generated during pitch oscillations is presented. The results show that these parameters change the instantaneous force coefficients quantitatively and qualitatively. The effective angle of attack is different at various locations of the airfoil chord during the oscillation motion, which determines the deviations of forces at the same angle of attack during pitch-up and pitch-down periods. It is also observed that the strength, interaction, and convection of the vortex surrounding the airfoil are significantly affected by the variations of these parameters.",32,1

The longitudinal dynamic model of generic AHVs is first redesigned and optimized for prediction, whereas the cost function of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is designed with series expansions and derivative feedback. A disturbance-observer-based control (DOBC) law is then developed for enhancing robustness in the presence of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties. The relationship among tracking errors, sample time, and estimation errors is finally investigated. Compared with existing tracking control for AHVs, the proposed DOB-NMPC achieves tracking commands effectively without sacrificing the nominal tracking performance, and the convergence range of tracking errors is verified by stability analysis and simulation studies.",32,1

The air-bearing table is a spacecraft simulator that can simulate frictionless conditions with three rotational degrees of freedom. Balancing the simulator is essential in order to make the gravitational torque negligible. The testbed is also equipped with a Helmholtz cage to recreate the Earth’s magnetic field conditions that spacecrafts encounter in orbit.

The unloading/reloading fiber axial stress distributions were analyzed, considering different fiber–matrix interface damage regions. The interface debonding and slip lengths upon unloading/reloading were obtained, considering the coupling effects of multiple loading stress levels and interface damage. The relationships between the hysteresis loops, interface debonding and sliding, and different loading sequences were established. Comparisons of damage evolution between constant and variable fiber–matrix interface shear stress, constant peak stress with cycle loading and multiple loading, and low-high multiple loading and high-low multiple loading sequences were conducted. The experimental cyclic multiple loading/unloading stress–strain hysteresis loops and fiber–matrix interface slip lengths of 2D SiC/SiC composites were predicted for different testing temperatures and applied cycles. The effects of temperature on the fiber–matrix interactions and the evolution of interfacial shear stress and the effect of cyclic loading number on the multiple-step loading damage evolution of two different SiC/SiC composites are discussed. With increasing temperature and applied cycle number, the area of the hysteresis loops and the interface debonding/sliding lengths subjected to multiple loading stress levels increase.",32,1
13,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000956,"Structural health monitoring (SHM) is the process of conducting structural condition diagnosis and prognosis based on appropriate analyses of in situ measurement data. Direct assessment of structural condition using time series response measurements can be classified as a type of statistical pattern recognition, in which structural condition is evaluated by comparing the statistical features of current data with those of baseline data. The philosophy behind this approach is that the time series response acquired under different structural conditions presents different statistical characteristics. As a consequence, the key step in structural condition classification is to detect the points at which the statistical properties of a time series response change; this is referred to as change-point analysis. The present study proposes the use of a computationally efficient binary segmentation (BS) approach for change-point detection in order to classify and assess structural health condition. The proposed approach, which falls into the category of data-driven diagnosis, does not require knowledge about the structure and is appealing for attaining an automated SHM system. The practicality and effectiveness are illustrated through real-world monitoring data acquired from a cable-stayed bridge and a high-speed train, both of which experienced structural damage/degradation over their service lives.",32,1
14,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000937,"The technique of prestressing near-surface-mounted (NSM) carbon fiber–reinforced polymer (CFRP) has good potential and future prospects for structural strengthening due to its improvement of the bond between the CFRP and concrete. However, notably few investigations have been conducted to study the bond durability of the NSM CFRP–concrete interface. The present study was undertaken to increase the understanding of the durability of the bond between the NSM CFRP and concrete under freeze-thaw cycles. Pull-out tests were conducted to investigate the influence of freeze-thaw cycles on the interfacial bond with ordinary concrete and concrete with high strength or additional frost resistance. The mechanism of freeze-thaw cycles degrading the bond of the NSM CFRP is discussed. Additionally, the influence of the distance between concrete edge and groove (edge distance) and the bond length on the bond durability was studied. It was found that, first, freeze-thaw cycling results in a significant decrease in compressive strength of ordinary concrete but a unremarkable degradation of strength of high-strength concrete and concrete with water-reducing agents and admixtures of air-entraining agents. Second, freeze-thaw cycling also leads to a relatively significant decrease in the bond of the NSM CFRP systems with ordinary concrete; however, it has no substantial impact on the bond of specimens of concrete with high strength or frost resistance. This indicates that the deterioration of the bond of NSM CFRP under freeze-thaw cycles is caused by the degradation of concrete. Third, a decrease in the edge distance results in cone-shaped cracks at the loaded end. Finally, when the failure mode remains debonding at the NSM CFRP–concrete interface, the NSM CFRP system with a longer bond length exhibits more significant degradation in bond capacity compared with that with a shorter bond length. This is because the residual friction stress at the debonding interface also decreases due to freeze-thaw cycling; thus, a longer bond length corresponds to a great loss of residual friction force at the debonding zone.",32,1

This paper presents a novel dual-functional electromagnetic energy harvester (DF-EEH) that is regarded as an electrically tuned mass damper (TMD) to simultaneously suppress vibration and harvest energy. The equal modal damping method is proposed to optimize parameters of the DF-EEH. Furthermore, a resonant circuit is utilized to improve the energy harvesting performance and vibration suppression efficiency of the space rack. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize tuning frequencies and damping ratios of the DF-EEH with the resonant circuit. For the DF-EEH with both the resistor and resonant circuit, the response of the space rack is reduced to 9.29, and the harvested energy is 0.41  W/N.

The results indicate that the auxiliary air inlet significantly improves the performance of the SJA, especially for small orifices and high actuation frequencies. Compared with the conventional piston-type SJA, the mass flow of the novel SJA is increased significantly, which is the major reason for the increase in cylinder pressure, maximum jet momentum, duty cycle, and efficiency of the actuator.",32,1

This new aluminum 7175, dubbed aluminum ECO7175v1, results in a cleaner manufacturing process and improves mechanical properties. The fatigue behavior of the new aluminum ECO7175v1 T74 temper is investigated. Experimental data show that the fatigue life of ECO7175v1-T74 aluminum can exceed 107 cycles with a fatigue strength of approximately 207 MPa, about 36% of its tensile strength. Fractography results show that failure modes are predominately ductile near the surface and brittle toward the center.

Irrespective of the stresses to which the specimens are subjected, all crack initiation points are located at the surface and no inclusions to act as stress concentrators are seen.",32,1

The lateral displacement of a first-story shear wall was successfully monitored in a hysteresis test of a steel frame–reinforced concrete infill wall. A FBG relative displacement sensor was developed refitting a superwide-range fiber Bragg grating displacement sensor based on eccentric gear. The refitted sensor was applied in a self-repairing performance test of a shape memory alloy (SMA) strengthened concrete beam.

For identifying parameters of the inelastic response of a structure under ground shaking, the Kalman filter (KF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) have been used extensively. In this paper, numerical and experimental investigations were carried out to test the capabilities of square-root unscented Kalman filters (SRUKF) and adaptive square-root unscented Kalman filters (ASRUKF) for identifying the parameters of the nonlinear structural system, with the Bouc-Wen model applied to describe the nonlinear hysteresis of magnetorheological elastomer materials. A new method was proposed for parameter initial values estimation, which could ensure that the parameters in the constitutive equation be identified uniquely and thus reduce the influence of the initial error on the parameter estimation. The numerical investigation showed that the ASRUKF outperformed the SRUKF in both convergence speed and estimation accuracy. Furthermore, the ASRUKF was able to track the sudden change of the parameter whereas the SRUKF was not. The experimental results indicate that the estimated Bouc-Wen model through ASRUKF not only presents a good match with the experimental data for a specific input but also keeps physical properties that are inherent to the real data, independently of the exciting input.",32,1

Considerable aerodynamic drag and severe aerothermal loads are major challenges for hypersonic vehicles. A novel combinational aerodisk and lateral jet concept is proposed for drag reduction and thermal protection in hypersonic flows. The flow field characteristics have been numerically investigated with in-house code. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were adopted to simulate the flow field, and the shear stress transport (SST) k−ω turbulence model was used to present the turbulent nature. Fluid–thermal interaction is also taken into consideration in this paper. The influences of the lateral jet pressure ratio and its location on the flow field have been thoroughly studied using numerical methods. The obtained results demonstrate that the novel concept is beneficial for drag reduction and thermal protection in hypersonic flows. Increasing the lateral jet pressure ratio can further improve drag reduction performance. In addition, the heat flux can be significantly reduced by increasing the lateral jet pressure ratio. The lateral jet location also has important effects on the flow properties.

To improve aerodynamic performance and optimize flight attitude control, the authors developed a set of circulation-control actuators (CCAs) based on circulation-control (CC) technology to replace the conventional rudder surface and applied these CCAs to a flight test of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The authors measure the main characteristic parameters of the CCAs and the flow-field characteristics, which indicate that the CCAs can suppress separation and delay stall at high angles of attack. An experimental assessment of rudder efficiency shows that the CCAs can produce the rudder efficiency required for conventional flight attitude control. Specifically, the maximum roll rudder efficiency that the CCA generates is equivalent to an aileron deflection of 50°, and the maximum pitch rudder efficiency is equivalent to an elevator deflection of 10° at a speed of 10  m/s. Finally, a successful flight test of a rudderless (meaning no control surface) UAV based on CC technology indicates that the CCAs designed in this study could replace conventional ailerons and elevators completely to establish control of aircraft flight attitude.",32,1

The mission requires spaced antenna arrays and an ultraclose separation distance from the edge of the spaced antenna arrays in order to have an accuracy within millimeters. During maneuvers, the vibration of the antenna is excited by the translational and rotational motion of the spacecraft; in return, the coupling effect influences the accuracy of the spaced antenna arrays and leads to the risk of collision. For this reason, we present a coupled dynamics model of a flexible spacecraft utilizing dual quaternion parameterization. A novel feature of this model is that the translational motion, rotational motion, and vibration of the flex-rigid system can all be described under the same mathematical framework by representing the vibration utilizing dual quaternion parameterization in the modal coordinates. Numerical results are presented to quantify the kinematic coupling effect and to show that the effect is a key consideration for ultraclose formations.",32,1

The full nonlinear elongation dynamics of the space tether system were established for a superlong viscoelastic massless tether with a large tip mass. The equilibria and their stabilities were investigated by removing the external force in the established dynamics. The equilibria and the stabilities depend on the elasticity and natural length of the tether, and the dependence is the key to determining the parameters for successful operation of the tether system. The equilibria were also used as reference positions to facilitate dynamic analysis. The method of multiple scales was utilized to obtain the analytical asymptotic solutions to the dynamics. The analytical results agree well with the numerical ones quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the steady-state magnitudes of the length and the length rate of the tether, as well as the power harvested for a large range of parameters. The detailed investigation reveals that the dynamic responses were affected by three important parameters, namely, the damping, the elasticity, and the original length of the tether. In particular, the increasing damping stabilizes the motion around the expected equilibrium and makes the quasi-periodic motion periodic. It was also indicated that one should design a tether with small rigidity for efficient power generation, but the largest steady-state length should be restricted within prescribed ranges when selecting the rigidity. There is also a compromise between the power output and elastic tension when designing the tether system, i.e., the tether will experience a larger elastic tension for greater harvested power.",32,1

Measurements were carried out to study the effects of square corrugations on triangular tabs in controlling the mixing of a supersonic elliptic jet of Mach number 1.5 of aspect ratio 3.37. The blockage caused by the simple tab is 2.5% each for two tabs. Whereas, for the corrugated tab, the corrugations over the tab side bring down the geometrical blockage to 2.2%. The experiments were carried out for nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, covering both favorable and adverse pressure gradients. The pitot pressure variation along the axis (CPD) of the jets, without control, corrugated, and uncorrugated tabs, revealed that both tabs are leading to a considerable mixing enhancement of the supersonic elliptic jet at all pressure conditions studied. But, unlike the axisymmetric jet, the CPDs for both of the tabs overlap, especially in the near-field region. The core length for the uncontrolled jet is around five times the equivalent exit diameter of the nozzle exit (5D); whereas, it comes down to about one times the equivalent diameter of the nozzle exit (1D) for both the tabs at NPR 3. Therefore, both simple and corrugated triangular tabs at the minor axis could reduce the core length by about 80%. Therefore, the performance of corrugated triangular tabs to control the elliptic jet is similar to the simple triangular tabs. But, since the blockage offered by the corrugated tabs is smaller, it is advantageous from a propulsion point of view.",32,1
