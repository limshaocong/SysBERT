Taking the layout design of a simplified commercial communication satellite as a background, based on the cooperative coevolutionary framework, this paper presents a coevolutionary method with heuristic rules for the optimal layout design of a satellite module. First, a whole satellite module layout problem is decomposed into several sublayout problems according to the multisubphysical structure of a satellite module. Second, a relaxation model is adopted to distribute all objects among subspaces. Third, a coevolutionary genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the detailed layout design within the subspaces. Finally, a heuristic combination-rotation (CR) method is adopted to adjust the constraints to obtain the final whole layout scheme. Compared with the coevolutionary approach and the all-at-once optimization approaches, computational results show that the CR method can improve the computational accuracy of solutions and the proposed heuristic coevolutionary method can produces better solutions within short running times.",22,2

In large mines, the walking dragline is a dominant strip mining machine. Dragline performance depends on the operating speed, the bucket payload, and the machine availability, which could be negatively impacted by the actions taken to increase the machine productivity. In this study, the writers develop the kinematics and dynamic modeling of a dragline front-end assembly using the vector loop and simultaneous constraint methods. Based on the results of the kinematics and dynamic simulations, stress modeling and analysis are performed. Detailed analysis of the simulation results show that the angular accelerations of the drag and hoist ropes are close to zero, which indicate very smooth simulated operations. The respective maximum drag and hoist forces are 100 and 75kN, which also indicate a dominant drag operation. The maximum stress loading of the boom’s Arm-1 (166.5MPa) and Arm-2 (159.9MPa) are less than the boom yield stress at 305MPa. These results indicate machine health and longevity within the simulated conditions.",22,2

Once in space, the experiment is designed to inflate and rigidize three composite tubes (which could be used in a more global space structure), then perform a vibration analysis on each by exciting the structures using piezoelectric patches mounted to the walls of the tubes and collect data via accelerometers. The experiment is designed to take part in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) get-away-special program and as such must meet structural verification standards to be pay loaded as such. This paper presents the structural and vibration analysis of the RIGEX assembly and inflatable composite tubes using ABAQUS finite-element analysis (FEA) software. Results of the FEA showed good correlation when compared to eigenvalue/eigenvector experimental results obtained from ping testing the actual structures. This finite-element analysis has been used to modify the experiments design to meet NASA structural integrity requirements and verify the natural frequency of the RIGEX structural support assemblies.",22,2

By taking flexible vibrations of solar panels and a flexible antenna as an external disturbance, and using only the estimated transformation matrix of control input, a simplified dynamic model has been used to replace the accurate dynamic model of a rigid body in a flexible multibody satellite dynamics model. Simulation results indicate that the attitude ADRC designed still has the original dynamic response when large external disturbance acts on the system. Therefore, we come to the conclusion that the ADRC designed can be used to solve the problem of control systems with uncertainties in the process of modeling different flexible multibody systems.",22,2

In this design approach, attitude control system and vibration suppression were designed separately using a lower order model. Based on the sliding mode control (SMC) and backstepping technique, a new attitude controller in the form of the input voltage of the reaction wheel is derived to control the attitude motion of a spacecraft, in which the reaction wheel dynamics is also considered from the real applications point of view. Here the sliding mode technique is used to achieve an asymptotic convergence of the attitude and angular velocity tracking errors in the presence of parameter variation and disturbance by providing a virtual torque input at the rigid body while the backstepping technique is used to regulate the input voltage of the actuator to provide the required torque. The asymptotic stability is shown using a Lyapunov analysis. Furthermore, an adaptive version of the proposed attitude control law is also designed for adapting the unknown upper bounds of the lumped disturbance so that the limitation of knowing the bound of the disturbance in advance is released. For actively suppressing the induced vibration, strain rate feedback control methods are presented by using piezoelectric materials as additional sensors and actuators bonded on the surface of the flexible appendages. The performances of the hybrid control schemes are assessed in terms of attitude tracking and level of vibration reduction in comparison to the proportional-derivative and conventional SMC. Both analytical and numerical results are presented to show the theoretical and practical merit of this hybrid approach.",22,2

It creates a uniform layer of compressive residual stress at surfaces and considerably increases the part life. This study is devoted to an evaluation of the edge (corner) effects in the shot peening process. Geometry variations in metal parts such as edges or corners cause variance in the residual stress profile induced by shot peening. This paper presents the finite-element modeling and scheme that we use to simulate the shot peening process by both single impact and multiple impacts for part geometries with different edge radii. The results achieved show that, after the same shot peening process, a part with a relatively larger edge radius results in a satisfactory residual stress profile which could equal or exceed that expected for a part with a smaller edge radius. The results may enable the automated edge preprocess step for shot peening with an easily machined large radius to reduce cost and improve productivity.",22,2

We assume that the chaser spacecraft has variable mass and that its trajectory is governed by three controls, one determining the thrust magnitude and two determining the thrust direction. We employ the Clohessy–Wiltshire equations, describing the relative motion of the chaser vis-à-vis the target, and the multiple-subarc sequential gradient-restoration algorithm to produce first optimal trajectories and then guidance trajectories for the following problems: P1—minimum time, fuel free; P2—minimum fuel, time free; P3—minimum time, fuel given; P4—minimum fuel, time given; and P5—minimum time×fuel, time and fuel free. Clearly, P1 and P2 are basic problems, while P3, P4, and P5 are compromise problems. Problem P1 leads to a two-subarc solution including a max-thrust subarc followed by another max-thrust subarc. Problem P2 leads to a four-subarc solution including two coasting subarcs alternating with two max-thrust subarcs. Problems P5 leads to a three-subarc solution including two max-thrust subarcs alternating with one coasting subarc. Problems P3 and P4 include P1, P2, and P5 as particular cases and lead to two-, three-, or four-subarcs solutions depending on the prescribed value of fuel or time. For all problems, the thrust magnitude control is saturated at one of its extreme values: in optimization studies, we determine the best thrust direction controls; in guidance studies, we force the thrust direction controls to be constant in each subarc and determine the best thrust direction parameters. Of course, the time lengths of all the subarcs must also be determined. The computational results show that, for Problems P1–P5, the performance index of the multiple-subarc guidance trajectory approximates well the performance index of the multiple-subarc optimal trajectory: the pairwise relative differences in performance index are less than 1∕100 in all cases. To sum up, the produced guidance trajectories are highly efficient and yet quite simple in implementation.",22,2

Furthermore, aerodynamic twist can be built into the wing through the use of a thin membrane skin, to adaptively increase the wing camber. This work formulates a static aeroelastic model of such a wing, by coupling a linear membrane model to a well-validated steady laminar Navier–Stokes solver. The membrane deformation causes a significant pressure redistribution which increases lift and longitudinal static stability, though a drag penalty also develops. The efficiency of a rigid wing increases with Reynolds number, but decreases for a membrane wing, as the deformation generally provides a nonoptimal airfoil shape. Membrane deformation leads to larger separation bubbles, and acts as a barrier to the tip vortex formation. At high angles of attack, the aerodynamic twist causes a direct interaction between the recirculating flow and the tip vortices, indicating potential roll instabilities.",22,2

Among SHM techniques, Lamb waves are widely used since they can cover large areas from a single location. The development of various structural simulation programs has lead to increasing interest in whether SHM data obtained from the simulation can be verified by experimentation. The objective of this research is to determine the Lamb wave responses of SHM models using the finite-element software package ABAQUS CAE as a computational tool for an isotropic plate. These results are compared to experimental results and theoretical predictions under isothermal and thermal gradient conditions to assess the sensitivity of piezoelectric generated Lamb wave propagation. Simulations of isothermal tests are conducted over a temperature range of 0–190°F using 100 and 300kHz as excitation frequencies. The changes in temperature-dependent material properties are used to measure the differences in the response signal’s waveform and propagation speed. An analysis of the simulated signal response data demonstrated that elevated temperatures delay the Lamb wave propagation, although the delays are found to be minimal at the temperatures tested.",22,2
