In this paper, robust optimization is first adopted to address the design of cable-network antenna structures with imperfect cable lengths. First, an analytical sensitivity analysis method is proposed to evaluate the effects of the uncertainties on the shape precision and cable tensions. Second, based on the sensitivities, the mathematical model of the robust design is established. At last, the proposed method is applied to a 3-m-diameter cable-network antenna structure. The analytical sensitivities are validated by comparing with the sensitivities computed by finite-difference method, and the feasibility of the presented robust design model is demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations. The numerical experiments show that the robustness is greatly increased by the application of the robust design method. The results recommend that higher tension level, more elastic cables, thicker tension ties, and slenderer net cables can benefit the robust ability of cable network antenna structures.",29,2

An incompressible fluid fills the porous space. The fluid is electrically conducting in the presence of an applied magnetic field. The governing nonlinear partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary differential equations by similarity transformations. The analytic solutions are presented in series form by the homotopy analysis method. Convergence of the obtained series solutions is explicitly discussed. The velocity and temperature profiles are shown and analyzed for different emerging parameters of interest. It is observed that by increasing the volume of copper nanoparticles, the thermal conductivity increases and the boundary layer thickness decreases. The velocity profile increases and temperature profile decreases for the larger velocity slip parameter. The temperature is a decreasing function of the thermal slip parameter. Hence, less heat is transferred to the fluid from the sheet.",29,2

To better understand the shear strength and deformation behavior of lunar soils at low confining stress and to facilitate the modeling and simulation of lunar activities, a series of consolidated drained triaxial compression tests were performed on numerous samples of lunar-soil simulant developed by Tsinghua University, China (named as QH-E). Great care was taken to conduct the experimental studies at low confining stresses such that reliable results can be obtained. The measured data suggest that QH-E samples exhibited strain-softening behavior with typical residual shear strength behavior characteristics. It was also found the residual internal friction angle φcs approximately 40°, regardless of confining stress, σ3 and relative density, Dr, whereas the peak apparent cohesion intercept ca−p is not equal to zero owing to the nonlinear behavior of shear strength of QH-E. However, the residual value of apparent cohesion intercept ca−cs is equal to zero. The rate of change of dilatancy angle at low confining stress values is greater than those at the conventional confining stress values. Further, based on the measured data from this study, two empirical models were suggested to predict the tangent modulus E and shear modulus G of QH-E at low confining stress, and according to the prediction models for internal friction angle and dilatancy angle in the literature, the model parameters of QH-E at low confining stress were determined.",29,2

Similarity transformation is used to convert the nonlinear governing equations and their associated boundary conditions into dimensionless form. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations is then solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method along with shooting technique. Numerical results are obtained for velocity, temperature, and concentration distribution as well as for the skin friction coefficient, the local Nusselt number, and Sherwood number. It is found that the local Nusselt number and Sherwood number decrease with an increase in Casson parameter γ. However, the skin friction coefficient -f″(0) increases with an increase in Casson parameter γ and decreases with an increase in velocity ratio parameter A. The results are displayed both in graphical and tabular form to illustrate the effect of the governing parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature, and concentration. Then, comparison has been made and found to be in good agreement with a previous published result on special cases of the problem.",29,2

The composite plates are modelled using a recently developed nonpolynomial shear deformation theory, which considers the required shear deformation effects in terms of an inverse hyperbolic function of thickness coordinate. The aerodynamic load is calculated by implementing linear piston theory including the influence of yaw angle. An isoparametric generalized finite-element formulation is developed for the aeroelastic analysis taking into account of required structural equations such as constitutive relations, kinematics relations, displacement field, and the principle of minimum potential energy together with the supersonic aerodynamics based on linear piston theory. The results are obtained by solving the developed system of governing equations for the flutter boundary, and the obtained results are validated against the existing analytical and numerical solutions. It is concluded that the developed formulation is accurate and efficient for the investigation of flutter behavior of laminated composite plates. Moreover, the strength and stiffness properties of composite plates are greatly influenced by fiber orientation, stacking sequence and material orthotropic ratio, flow characteristics are dependent on the flow angle, and geometric conditions mainly depend upon the boundary conditions. The influences of these stiffness characteristics (fiber orientation, stacking sequence, and material orthotropic ratio), geometric characteristics, and flow characteristics on the flutter boundary are examined and various benchmark conclusions are made. It is concluded that stiffness, flow, and geometric parameters must be considered as essential design parameters for enhanced flutter speed of supersonic vehicles fabricated of composite materials.",29,2

Even though other research showed that direct velocity control and then position-and-velocity control are feasible, they require perfect or almost perfect collocation of velocity sensors and actuators. A very simple parallel feedforward device, which uses basic stabilizability properties of systems in order to allow implementation of strict positive real configurations, is tested here and is shown to eliminate the need for velocity feedback and collocation.",29,2

A total of two scales of actuator apparatuses having either 40- or 80-mm-diameter piezoelectric discs were used. A temperature-compensated hot wire, laser displacement sensor, and dynamic pressure transducers were used to quantify the performance of a given actuator. The synthetic jet generation process was divided into its main components, diaphragm displacement, cavity pressure, and orifice velocity, which were analyzed in detail in both their peak values and time responses. The phase shift between the disc displacement and velocity signals were found to be mainly attributed to compressibility effects. Doubling the diameter and thickness of the piezoelectric disc was found to double the output jet velocity and shift the operation frequency range of the system. In addition, a dual disc configuration was used, which yielded an approximately 40% higher jet velocity than its single disc configuration. Using the knowledge acquired from these experiments resulted in a synthetic jet having a peak velocity of 211  m/s out of a 12×1-mm rectangular orifice at 700 Hz, which is significantly stronger than any similar actuator reported in the literature.",29,2

Using a grid-based discrete scheme, a modified minimum cost network flow (MCNF) algorithm over a large-scale network is proposed. Using the Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and discrete dynamic equations of motion, the four-dimensional (4D) trajectory (three spatial and one time dimensions) from a source to a destination is obtained exactly through minimization of a cost functional subject to the nonlinear dynamics and mission constraints of the UAV. Several objectives (including the arc length, fuel consumption, flight time, and risk of threat regions) may be assigned to each arc in the network. The algorithm uses scalarization, by which a multiobjective problem can be tackled by repeatedly solving a single-objective subproblem. An attempt is made to reduce the time order of the algorithm using innovative techniques to construct a polynomial-time algorithm. Moreover, owing to the increasing deviation of the inertial navigation system (INS) in terms of time, flying safely and avoding a collision with terrain at low altitudes is a significant problem in the trajectory design of this type of vehicle. An attempt is made to add this constraint to the algorithm to produce a practical and safe trajectory with no evident increase in the complexity and execution time. Numerical results are presented to verify the capability of the proposed approach to generate an admissible trajectory in the minimum possible time compared to previous approaches.",29,2

The control strategy has two steps. In the first step, a discrete-time robust virtual controller is designed to produce three axis moments. In the second step, the fault information will be used to reconfigure the robust fault-tolerant control allocation once an actuator fault is detected. A fault-detection scheme is assumed to exist for estimating the actuator fault. The robust virtual controller and the proposed robust fault-tolerant control allocation are applied to a discrete-time ADMIRE aircraft model. Simulation results demonstrate that the reference signals can be well tracked when the control surface is damaged. Thus the proposed robust fault-tolerant control allocation scheme is valid for input-redundant systems to recover from control surface failure, and simultaneously guarantee robustness to the uncertain control effectiveness matrix and disturbance.",29,2
9,https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)AS.1943-5525.0000524,"During maneuvering flight, a spacecraft is subject to the engine thrust besides the gravitational force fields of celestial bodies. Moreover, the engine thrust model can hardly be built accurately due to its imbalance. Accordingly, the traditional orbit dynamic mode cannot predict the state accurately, which results in a great decline of navigation filter performance. In order to solve this problem, a state prediction model based on starlight Doppler is proposed for orbital maneuver. In this model, the velocity of the spacecraft is obtained from the starlight Doppler measurement instead of the orbit dynamic model. According to the measured velocities and the constant acceleration model, the state in the navigation filter can be predicted precisely. By this means, the state prediction is not influenced by engine thrust. The proposed state prediction model is applied in the XNAV (X-ray pulsar navigation) system for orbital maneuver. In this navigation system, the starlight Doppler velocity and the pulse time-of-arrival from the X-ray pulsar are utilized to predict and update the state, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that the state provided by the starlight Doppler-based state prediction model is immune to the engine thrust. The starlight Doppler prediction-based XNAV can provide highly-accurate navigation information for spacecraft orbital maneuvers.",29,2

In this paper, an agile decision support system (ADSS) for aircraft design was proposed by comprehensively integrating and applying modeling and simulation (M&S), artificial intelligence, data mining, and group decision-making technology. The ADSS provides a rich set of simulation, assessment, and optimization tools for decision makers, which can offer an important objective reference to effectively improve the decision accuracy. A simulation and test environment was implemented for rapid assessment of different designs based on the developed multidisciplinary and multiphysical coupling virtual prototyping models and three kinds of virtual test methods. In the process of group decision making, valuable application modes can be discovered through data mining to reduce decision-making difficulty and improve the efficiency. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis–based multilevel optimization strategy was developed for high-dimensional optimization design problems to meet the fast response requirement of the ADSS. Different cases were given for the data mining application, virtual test, and optimization design, respectively, to validate the proposed agile decision-making process.",29,2

The system of governing equations is first nondimensionalized, and then similarity transformations are used to convert the governing partial differential equations into a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. A numerical algorithm is applied to this boundary value problem (BVP) of coupled ordinary differential equations. Collocation method is used for the solution of the nonlinear ordinary BVP. The dimensionless analysis revealed that the dimensionless field variables (velocity, temperature, and nanoparticle volume fraction), and the flow characteristics (skin friction factor, heat transfer, and nanoparticle volume fraction transfer) in the respective boundary layers depend on the Prandtl number (Pr), the Lewis numbers (Le), the thermophoresis parameter (Nt), the Brownian motion parameter (Nb), the buoyancy ratio parameter (Nr), the convective parameter (γ), the reaction parameter (K), first-order velocity slip parameter (a), and second-order velocity slip parameter (b).

Compared with common low-dynamic aircraft, the environmental affection during hypersonic flight leads to the non-Gaussian noise character of astronomic observation. Meanwhile, rapid star geometry changing during HCVs’ rapid movement causes redistribution of errors in astronomic measurements and significant variation of its main Gaussian characteristic. A kind of robust inertial/astronomic attitude determination algorithm with adaptive star geometrical error model is proposed. The adaptive star geometrical error distribution model is established for obtaining the main Gaussian model of astronomic measurement misalignment errors in flight. After that, inertial/astronomic integration model–based on misalignment errors is proposed, which avoids Euler angle transformation. On these bases, the improved robust filter algorithm is designed, which utilizes real-time astronomic error distribution as the weighting standard of Huber-based optimal estimation. Simulation results indicate that by taking the changing of main Gaussian distribution into consideration, the accuracy of inertial/astronomic integration is improved approximately 30% more than traditional algorithms adopting constant main Gaussian model in non-Gaussian HCV navigation environments.",29,2

Most existing research works only focus on orbit determination problems for orbital vehicles in outer space while its working domain is limited. In order to expand its applicable area and improve information utilization, a new fault-tolerant stellar refraction-based inertial/celestial integrated navigation system is designed in this work, which is supposed to provide accurate position, velocity, and attitude information for aerospace vehicles that either make a maneuvering flight in near space or move in a predetermined Earth orbit in outer space. First, a new nonlinear navigation system dynamic model is established by error-prorogation equations of the strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) in the Earth-centered inertial (ECI) frame, in which additive quaternion with less model error is used for attitude computation. Secondly, celestial navigation subsystem (CNS) is used to indirectly sense the horizon by utilizing the starlight atmospheric refraction model and determine the vehicle attitude by means of a multistar vector observation method.
