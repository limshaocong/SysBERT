These experiments are complicated by the wind-tunnel geometry downstream of the test section that creates upstream-traveling reflections. In this work, active noise control is implemented in a closed-circuit wind tunnel to eliminate these reflections. The control system filters an input signal to drive two speakers downstream of the test section. These speakers create upstream-traveling sound that destructively interferes with the reflections. Without the controller activated, the average downstream- and upstream-traveling waves are 98 and 85 dB, respectively. With the controller activated, the upstream-traveling reflections are reduced up to 31 dB at , and 29 dB at . The performance of the controller decreases as the frequency approaches the planar-wave-cutoff frequency of the test section due to nonplanar waves created by the control speakers. Active noise control is also used to reduce upstream-traveling tonal background noise up to 12 dB. The adaptive control system allows greater experimental control during sound-receptivity experiments.",52,9

The Gaussian moment closure is briefly reviewed, as is an extension that allows for the treatment of flow of diatomic gases. A parallel upwind, finite volume scheme with adaptive mesh refinement using a Roe-type numerical flux function is described for solving the hyperbolic system of partial differential equations arising from this closure on multiblock meshes with embedded and possibly moving boundaries. The purely hyperbolic nature of moment equations makes them particularly insensitive to discretizations involving grids with irregularities. Typical of adaptive mesh-refinement, embedded-boundary, and Cartesian cut-cell treatments, mesh irregularities are difficult to deal with when second derivatives are required by the physical model. Such is the case for the Navier–Stokes equations. Numerical solutions to mathematical descriptions involving second derivatives show significantly degraded solution quality as compared to solutions of first-order quasi-linear moment equations. Solid-wall boundary conditions are implemented via a Knudsen-layer approximation. Comparisons are made between numerical solutions of the Gaussian model on both body-fitted meshes and meshes with embedded boundaries, as well as to experimental and approximate analytic results for a variety of flow problems. The benefits and potential of the proposed approach for unsteady microscale flow applications having complex geometries are clearly demonstrated.",52,9
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052654,"Compact-reconstruction weighted essentially nonoscillatory schemes have lower dissipation and dispersion errors as well as higher spectral resolution than weighted essentially nonoscillatory schemes of the same order of convergence. Numerical experiments on benchmark inviscid flow problems have demonstrated improvements in the resolution and preservation of flow features such as vortices, discontinuities, and small-length-scale waves. This paper describes the integration of these schemes with a compressible, unsteady, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver and demonstrates their performance for two- and three-dimensional flow problems. The schemes are validated and verified for domains discretized by curvilinear and overset grids. Several flow examples demonstrate improvements in the resolution of boundary-layer and wake-flow features for solutions obtained by the compact-reconstruction weighted essentially nonoscillatory schemes. The results presented indicate that these schemes are well suited to aerodynamic problems where high-resolution numerical solutions of the near-body and wake flowfields are desired.",52,9
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052708,"Wind-tunnel experiments were conducted to quantify the effectiveness of ac and nanosecond-pulse single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators to suppress leading-edge stall on a NASA Energy Efficient Transport airfoil at Mach numbers up to 0.4 and chord Reynolds numbers up to . The airfoil model was designed to have a removable leading edge to accommodate two different leading-edge plasma-actuator designs, either with a thick ceramic or a thin Kapton dielectric layer. The exposed electrode for both plasma actuators was located at the leading edge of the airfoil. The covered electrode for both was on the suction side of the leading edge. The model was mounted on stages that measured the lift and drag forces and the pitching moment about the quarter-chord location. Both steady and unsteady ac plasma-actuator operation were examined. By its nature, the nanosecond-pulse plasma actuator only operates in unsteady operation. The optimal unsteady frequencies with regard to lift, lift to drag, and pitch moment for both actuators were examined. Although operating on different principles, both plasma-actuator approaches were able to increase the maximum lift coefficient and stall angle of attack for the full range of Mach numbers. Mach number scaling of the ac actuator lift enhancement is presented.",52,9
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052700,"The use of oscillating foils to develop turbines to extract energy from an oncoming flow has recently been found competitive with rotor blade designs. Moreover, the rectangular extraction plane of the oscillating-foil turbine presents clear advantages in the field of hydrokinetic turbines. The present study, based on two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes numerical simulations, focuses on the range of operating parameters maximizing power extracted by a single oscillating foil for small-scale application Reynolds number. The power-extraction efficiency is mapped in parametric spaces associated with different motion amplitudes. Efficiency maxima reach about 43% in all the parametric spaces considered, but for different values of pitching amplitude and frequency. It is found that the best parametric zones in all cases exhibit similar characteristics with regards to the effective angle of attack. Indeed, they are all associated with a maximum effective angle of attack of about 33 deg and a maximum (normalized) rate of change of the latter of 0.55. It is further observed that, contrary to laminar results previously published, the occurrence of leading-edge vortex shedding is not necessarily observed in optimal cases at these higher Reynolds number conditions.",52,9

The problem of modeling of smart laminates involves the coupling between mechanical and electrical fields. The structural component is modeled by an efficient equivalent single-layer plate theory, which ensures interlaminar shear-stress continuity and zero transverse shear-stress conditions at the top and bottom of the plate surfaces. Moreover, this theory contains unknowns defined at the reference plane (i.e., midplane) only. The electric field is modeled using layerwise theory, which contains the unknowns at each layer interfaces. The proposed combine model, which may be called a refined hybrid plate model, is implemented to analyze the coupled problem of piezoelectricity in laminated composites and sandwich plates.",52,9
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052712,"Aeroelastic systems with softening nonlinearity are not fully understood. The literature is not definitive, contains partial explanations, and even conflicting results. This problem is addressed for the case of a simple pitch-flap wing, with softening cubic nonlinearity in the pitch stiffness. Complex dynamical behavior is revealed. The study is carried out in three parts, the first of which is the identification and stability analysis of limit cycles in the frequency domain using describing functions combined with the Sherman–Morrison formula. Numerical integration of the nondimensionalized governing equations in the time domain is then carried out and, in addition to confirming the frequency domain results, new behavior is revealed, including asymmetric limit cycles and chaos. Finally, bifurcation analysis is undertaken using numerical continuation methods to reveal Hopf, symmetry breaking (pitchfork), fold and period doubling (flip) bifurcations. The effects of initial conditions and the proximity of limit cycle oscillation and chaos to static divergence are considered. Sections of the basin of attraction are presented for different wing configurations to show that the boundaries separating the different regions of dynamic behavior may be simple or nonsimple. It is found that some regions may appear where predicted stable limit cycle oscillation is free from the destabilizing effect of softening nonlinearity.",52,9
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052672,"Although time-domain solutions of the linearized Euler equations are well adapted to study the acoustic propagation in an outdoor environment, the modeling of sources in motion in time-domain solvers has not been investigated in the literature yet. This is done here by considering distributed volume sources. First, the influence of the spatial distribution of the source on the acoustic field is analyzed. Results obtained for a nonmoving source are summarized, and the example of a Gaussian spatial distribution is presented. The case of a harmonic volume source moving at a constant speed is then investigated in the geometrical far field. The directivity of a noncompact source is shown to be dramatically different from that of a point source. Numerical simulations are performed in a three-dimensional geometry in free-field configurations, and waveforms of the acoustic pressure exhibit Doppler shift and convective amplification. Finally, simulations of a broadband moving source above an impedance ground surface are presented. For a rigid ground, strong destructive and constructive interferences are observed. The numerical solution is in a very good agreement with an analytical solution. For finite-impedance surfaces, interferences are smoothed, and the acoustic pressure strongly depends on the impedance model. A low-frequency contribution is observed close to the ground in accordance with the ground characteristics.",52,9
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052715,"The design of morphing wings involves the disciplines of aerodynamics and structural mechanics; the aero-structural coupling is of chief importance in case smart materials are used as distributed actuators. Considering these specific requirements, this paper presents an approach to optimize concurrently the variables describing the wing external shape, the internal compliant structure, and the embedded actuators. An aeroelastic analysis tool is developed to simulate the response of distributed compliance three-dimensional wings, considering the activation of the smart materials. A method to formulate the optimization requirements based on the aircraft mission is presented, using the aerodynamic performance from the aeroelastic study in the optimization goal. To prove the validity and the computational feasibility of this methodology, a morphing wing for a 3-m-wingspan radio-controlled plane is optimized. A structural concept actuated by single crystal Macro Fiber Composites and dielectric elastomers is introduced, and its compliant structure is parameterized using a novel compact Voronoi-based representation. The optimized wing design produces rolling moments sufficient to guarantee the controllability of the flight. Numerical evaluation of the aerodynamic efficiency shows that an optimal activation of the embedded actuators further increases the advantages of morphing outside the design condition with respect to rigid wings.",52,9
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052725,"This paper considers the substitution of the computational-fluid-dynamics solver within an aerostructural coupling scheme by an efficient reduced-order surrogate model to realize high-fidelity nonlinear aeroelastic analyses within a fraction of the time compared to the corresponding coupled computational-fluid-dynamics analysis. The presented surrogate model approach is a combination of parameter reduction via proper orthogonal decomposition and system identification methods designed to cover nonlinear aerodynamic effects such as viscosity as well as transient effects. The investigated test case is the thick NLR7301 airfoil that shows significant nonlinear aerodynamic behavior along with nonnegligible viscous effects. The model is identified from a set of transient forced motion computational-fluid-dynamics analyses. After identification, the model is used to predict the discrete surface force distribution of the NLR7301 airfoil in static as well as transient coupled analyses. It is shown that the static aeroelastic equilibrium and the limit cycle oscillation case is predicted by the surrogate model with sufficient accuracy.",52,9
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052743,"This paper presents the numerical investigation of the unsteady separated flow around a simplified space-launcher afterbody. A zonal detached eddy simulation is used to deal with the high-Reynolds-number flow. The geometry consists of a cylinder of finite length extended by another cylinder of smaller diameter for the central body, and two cylinders similar to the Ariane 5 launcher boosters on each side. The main purpose was to evidence the impact of the side cylinders on the flow characteristics of the isolated central body. To this end, instantaneous and statistical results are compared to those of the isolated central body. The flow topology with side cylinders is found to be dramatically different from that of the axisymmetric case. The mean and rms values for the pressure and velocity fields appear to be organized along the two planes of symmetry of the geometry. Besides, the levels of the mean wall-pressure coefficients are lower by 10% in the three-body configuration. Conversely, the maximum rms coefficients are higher by approximately 45% and located in four quadrants bounded by the planes of symmetry. In the plane normal to the boosters, the mean solid reattachment length is shorter than that of the reference case by 25%. Finally, a three-dimensional Fourier analysis is performed, which highlights that the spectral content organization strongly depends on the location around the emerging cylinder, leading to very different properties of the dynamic buffet loads. Such significant discrepancies in the instantaneous, statistical, and fluctuating flow features suggest that the expertise gained from the axisymmetric body experiments cannot be straightforwardly extended to three-dimensional geometries.",52,9
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052765,"An aeroelastic model is developed by using multivariable solid-shell elements. Geometrical nonlinearity and the elimination of corresponding locking phenomena are considered accurately in the modeling. Unsteady aerodynamic forces are addressed by solving Euler flow dynamic equations. The computational-structural-dynamics solver is loosely coupled to the computational-fluid-dynamics solver, and the full match of the computational structural dynamics and computational fluid dynamics interfaces is achieved by three-dimensional modeling. An interpolation method using finite-element shape functions is developed to transform forces from aerodynamic grids to structural grids. The aerodynamic mesh deformation is obtained by using radial basis functions combined with the transfinite interpolation method. The aeroelastic model is validated through the study of the flutter and the limit cycle oscillation of a cropped delta wing in transonic flow. Moreover, the establishment of the aeroelastic model using multivariable solid shell elements is compared with other modeling methods. Improved numerical results show that the multivariable finite-element method is an efficient and capable tool for simulating geometrical nonlinearity, and the developed three-dimensional data-exchange method also plays a key role in the nonlinear aeroelastic modeling.",52,9
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052739,"Although simulating acoustic tones propagating in ducts or waveguides is relatively well established, broadband noise is composed of a wide range of frequencies, and at each frequency, the acoustic energy is generally distributed over all the cut-on modes of the duct. Simulating the propagation and absorption of broadband noise is further complicated by the random nature of the sound field. This paper presents a computational method to generate truly broadband, multimode noise in a time-domain simulation. This method is equally applicable to the generation of deterministic tones. For broadband noise, we devise a stochastic source that is tailored to radiate a sound field characterized by the cross-correlation between mode amplitudes. This stochastic source allows to compute in a single time-domain simulation the complete spectrum of the broadband multimode sound field. Unlike other methods proposed for predicting broadband noise, there is no need to perform several simulations for different realizations. Results are presented for broadband noise alone as well as for a combination of tones and broadband noise.",52,9
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052661,"Accurate predictions of the aeroelastic response of a rotorcraft are essential to minimize weight and estimate the fatigue life of rotary-wing aircraft components. Aeroelastic analyses are characterized by strong couplings between the aerodynamic loads and the structural response and are very time-consuming, in particular when computational-fluid-dynamics predictions of airloads are coupled with computational-structural-dynamics models. Simple aerodynamic models do not predict the response of the system with sufficient accuracy. A novel combined numerical and experimental algorithm, the load confluence algorithm, is developed to iteratively correct the numerical model of the external loads from minimal experimental data to best represent the experimental response. Aerodynamic loads are modeled with a simple approach, such as the lifting-line theory. The proposed algorithm uses the measured strains as inputs to a strain mapping algorithm, which then predicts force and moment corrections using a modal approach. These corrections are added to the lifting-line forces and moments to obtain a close correlation between measured and computed strains. This paper analyzes the influence of user-defined parameters on the convergence of the proposed approach. Results for three different steady forward-flight conditions of the UH-60A Black Hawk helicopter demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to accurately predict the flapwise, edgewise, and torsional internal moments along the blade with an accuracy that is comparable with detailed computational-fluid-dynamics analyses with a much reduced computational cost.",52,9
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052781,"This paper investigates the aerodynamic excitation mechanism of the rotor-tip flow instabilities leading to nonsynchronous vibration in a high-speed multistage axial compressor. Numerical simulations for the one-seventh annulus periodic sector of 1-1/2 stage are performed using an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver with a fully conservative, sliding interface, boundary condition to capture wake propagation between adjacent blade rows. The present numerical simulations for rigid blades demonstrate that the tip flow instability is the main cause of the compressor nonsynchronous vibration excitation and is generated by the circumferentially traveling vortices. The frequency of the vortex passing each blade in the counter-rotation direction is roughly equal to the nonsynchronous vibration excitation frequency. Three different rotor-tip clearance sizes and shapes are studied. The nonsynchronous vibration excitation frequency and amplitude vary slightly with the tip clearance size when the clearances have the same flat shape, but they change substantially when the tip clearance has a convex-type shape. The predicted nonsynchronous vibration excitation frequency is in excellent agreement with the rig testing.",52,9
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052754,"A multidisciplinary optimization to simultaneously enhance the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of an axial-flow fan was performed. Flow analysis through the axial-flow fan was conducted by solving three-dimensional steady and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with the shear-stress transport turbulence model. Starting with the results for the unsteady flow, aeroacoustic analysis was performed by solving the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings equations. A single-objective optimization for high-efficiency design was carried out before the multi-objective optimization. The single-objective optimization was conducted using a weighted average surrogate model with five design variables defining the hub-to-tip ratio, hubcap installation distance, hubcap ratio, and angle distributions at the midspan and blade tip. The objective function (i.e., the efficiency) was evaluated at the design points, sampled by Latin hypercube sampling in the design space, to construct the surrogate model. Then, multi-objective optimization on the basis of the single-objective optimization result was performed to simultaneously improve the efficiency and reduce the sound pressure level through a hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm coupled with a response surface approximation surrogate model with two design variables defining the sweep and lean angles at the blade tip. These objective functions were numerically accessed through the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic analyses. Arbitrary selected optimum designs in the Pareto-optimal solutions yielded increases in efficiency and decreases in the sound pressure level compared to the reference design.",52,9
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052793,"Image blurring is a problem encountered when pressure-sensitive paint is applied to rotating surfaces such as rotorcraft blades. The issue is particularly problematic near the leading and trailing edges of the blade; these are the regions where the impact of blurring is the most significant, yet they also contain the most valuable pressure information. Recent work has developed image-deblurring techniques based on deconvolution of the image with a point-spread function based on the known lifetime decay of pressure-sensitive paint and the rotation speed of the blade. This deblurring technique is effective in recovering information at the blade edges when the amount of blurring is not too high. However, the existing deblurring algorithm assumes rectilinear motion and uniform distribution of luminophore lifetime (i.e., constant pressure distribution). The objective of this work is to relax the rectilinear assumption by allowing for rotational blur and to assess the impact of strong pressure gradients on the resulting deblurred pressure distribution. The new deblurring scheme is evaluated by experiments on a spinning disk with a known pressure field and a corotating, grazing nitrogen jet. The sensitivity of the deblurred results to various input parameters is evaluated, and recommendations for further algorithm development are provided.",52,9
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053018,"A framework for aerothermoelastic-stability-boundary calculation for hypersonic configurations using computational fluid dynamics combined with radial basis functions for mesh deformation is developed. Application of computational fluid dynamics enables one to consider different turbulence conditions, laminar or turbulent, and different models of the air mixture, in particular real-gas model, which accounts for dissociation of molecules at high temperature. The effect of transition on the flutter margin of the heated structure is also considered using an uncertainty-propagation framework. The aerothermoelastic-stability margin of a three-dimensional low-aspect-ratio wing, representative of a control surface of a hypersonic vehicle, is investigated for various flight conditions. The system is found to be sensitive to turbulence modeling, as well as the location of the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Real-gas effects play a minor role for the flight conditions considered. This study demonstrates the advantages of accounting for uncertainty at an early stage of the analysis, and emphasizes the important relation between transition from laminar to turbulent, thermal stresses, and stability margins of hypersonic vehicles.",52,9
