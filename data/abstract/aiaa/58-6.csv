By scanning the laser frequency during the burst, the total scan time per velocity measurement can be reduced from 2–4 minutes (Cadel and Lowe, Optics and Lasers in Engineering, Vol. 71, Aug. 2015, pp. 51–61) to 10 ms, which is a speed increase of times.

1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059487,"Dynamic stall is exploited to produce positive torque on a large-chord/radius-ratio vertical-axis wind turbine. An elementary kinematic analysis shows that the blades experience large variations in angle of attack that produce deep dynamic stall, combined with large relative dynamic pressure variations, that are phase shifted by approximately 90 deg. The phase shift allows dynamic lift-overshoot effects associated with the formation of a dynamic stall vortex to drive the turbine when the relative dynamic pressure is high, whereas lift stall associated with shedding of the vortex occurs when the relative dynamic pressure is low. Blades also experience variable virtual camber (or “virtual morphing”) effects and favorable chordwise pressure gradients, where the former produces a virtual leading-edge droop that reduces the leading-edge angle of attack. Open jet wind-tunnel tests of a two-bladed model turbine revealed maximum power coefficients of 16% that were almost independent of . Flow visualization confirmed that dynamic stall, with the associated dynamic stall vortex, is the mechanism that drives the turbine to maximum power. Until reliable design tools are developed, either empiricism combined with dimensional analysis or high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics are proposed for optimization and analysis.",58,6

However, their ability to fly in adverse weather and turbulent flows is hindered by their low-Reynolds-number wings. It is shown that turbulence produces a significant pitching flow, as observed by the wing, which raises the possibility of intermittent dynamic stall comparable to a pitching airfoil situation. Two airfoils (one symmetrical and the other cambered) were tested in the wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers relevant to small UAVs: between 50,000 and 200,000. Two turbulence intensities of 5 and 15% were compared to sinusoidal pitching of the airfoils at equivalent amplitudes and three frequencies. It is shown that an increase in either the pitch amplitude or the onset turbulence intensity produces comparable changes in the time-averaged lift coefficient, and both experience forms of dynamic stall. The transient behavior is, however, significantly different; and the airfoil form has greater influence on the response to pitching motion than to turbulent flow.",58,6

Reducing the perceived noise produced by flapping wings without compromising or possibly enhancing their aerodynamic performance would be crucial in surveillance and military applications. To this aim, flapping wings have been designed and fabricated for which the supporting stiffeners tense the Mylar membrane to which they are bonded. The sound produced by these wings at different flapping frequencies has been recorded in an anechoic chamber simultaneously to the upward thrust they create. Comparing their characteristics and performance with those of flapping wings of conventional design suggests that tensing the wing’s membrane can increase the thrust while decreasing the typical rustling noise of the flapping wings.",58,6

In this work, and for the first time, their superior induced drag properties are verified in compressible and transonic regimes. The aerodynamic forces are obtained by analyzing computational fluid dynamics data, and the drag is subdivided in induced, viscous, and wave contributions. This decomposition is provided by a recently introduced aerodynamic force breakdown technique based on the vortex-force theory and allows an unambiguous definition of the lift-induced drag. The methodology is applicable to incompressible, compressible, and transonic flows. This paper will address whether the Best Wing system provides interesting induced drag performance also in transonic viscous flow.",58,6

A limiting factor is their variation in switching time, which often precludes their use. The purpose of this paper was to demonstrate the closed-loop control of a recently developed novel piezo-fluidic valve that reduces response time uncertainty at the expense of operating bandwidth. Use is made of the fact that a fluidic jet responds to a piezo tone by deflecting away from its steady-state position. A control signal used to vary this deflection is amplitude modulated onto the piezo tone. Using only a pressure measurement from one of the device output channels, an output-based linear quadratic Gaussian regulator was designed to follow a desired reference deflection, achieving control of a . Finally, the controller’s performance in terms of disturbance rejection and response time predictability is demonstrated.",58,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057764,"The formation and motion of vortices generated by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator under periodic burst-mode actuation are investigated. The flowfield is studied using particle image velocimetry and schlieren visualization. The induced flowfield is very different from the single starting vortex generated by turning on a continuous steady-state actuation of the DBD actuator. A train of periodic vortices is formed by the periodic burst-mode actuation, with each burst cycle generating one vortex that travels along and away from the wall. The effects of the burst frequency and duty-cycle ratio on the vortex motion and structure are studied, and similarity laws are discovered. The velocity at which the vortex moves is shown to be independent of the duty-cycle ratio of the actuation. The velocity component along the wall, however, is found to increase with the burst frequency. A time-averaged wall jet velocity based on the actuation time during each burst cycle is identified and found to be independent of the burst frequency but increase with the duty-cycle ratio of the actuation. Self-similar patterns of the vortex flowfield are demonstrated for a short time duration after the vortex is formed within each burst cycle.",58,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058930,"Numerical simulations are performed to provide an in-depth insight into the effect of instabilities on liquid jets discharging from elliptical orifices. The axis-switching phenomenon and breakup are simulated and characterized under the effect of disturbances imposed at the nozzle exit. The simulations are based on the volume of fluid approach and an adaptive meshing. A range of orifice aspect ratios from 1 to 4 at the Rayleigh breakup regime is considered. The evolution of the jet cross section and axis switching under the influence of disturbances is compared with that of nonperturbed elliptical jets. It is found that the axis-switching repetition and breakup length exponentially decrease with the initial amplitude of disturbances. For a fixed amplitude, the optimum wavenumber responsible for minimum breakup length is observed to be dependent on ellipticity of the orifice. Moreover, it is found that the form of final breakup leads to elimination of the satellite droplets at the optimum wavenumbers, while the droplet size decreases and becomes more uniform.",58,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058798,"The quasi-time-resolved flowfields of spatially oscillating jets emitted by fluidic oscillators at various installation angles, velocity ratios, and oscillation frequencies are examined experimentally. The velocity fields are acquired plane by plane using a stereoscopic particle image velocimetry system. Dominant streamwise vortices are identified and found to prevail downstream. The flowfield at a given velocity ratio is independent of the oscillation frequency because velocity ratio and Strouhal number are proportional. For small Strouhal numbers, the flowfield behaves similar to that of a vortex generating jet. For higher Strouhal numbers, the crossflow experiences a steady, wide-spread jet. When the skew angle decreases, one of the former two dominating vortices diminishes until at a skew angle of 45 deg one vortex dominates the flowfield. At a skew angle of 0 deg (i.e., the plane spanned by the oscillating jet is parallel to the crossflow), the jet penetration is comparable to that of a steady jet, and a pair of co-existing, counter-rotating vortices is identified. When changing the inclination angle, the flow features in the far field reduce to two dominant streamwise vortices whose spanwise effect increases when the inclination angle decreases. Additionally, the Strouhal number effects are shifted toward higher Strouhal numbers.",58,6

Modulations on flow characteristics by the vortex excitation are revealed by comparing the excited jet with the free jet through a large-eddy simulation (LES) technique. The modeling results have achieved good agreements with the available literature data in terms of time-averaged near-field variables, Mach disk dimensions, and dominant frequencies. A grid-convergence study is also performed to verify the fidelity of LES results. Ultimately, qualitative and quantitative comparisons of mean and instantaneous jet fields are conducted. It is demonstrated that the vortex excitation has enhanced the mixing of the injection nitrogen with the environment by a considerably increased mixing level and a faster mixing process in the middle jet. The vortex excitation modulates the buildup process of shocks and vortex structures, resulting in an intensified shock/shear-layer interaction and an accelerated turbulence transition process, which combine to improve mixing efficiency. The dominant instability mode is altered to a higher-order multiple helical mode from a single helical mode, and an intensified screech tone is achieved by the vortex excitation.",58,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058887,"Transient behaviors of unstarting and unstarted flows have been experimentally investigated in a Mach 6 freestream flow with and without boundary-layer suction in a scramjet isolator. The test scramjet model has a rectangular cross section and simulates the full flowpath of a scramjet engine. The suction control is activated by a fast-acting solenoid valve while an unsteady unstarting flow evolves in the model scramjet. A nonreacting jet is injected into the model combustor to mimic the flow choking of unstarting scramjets. The choked flow then initiates an unstart shock wave that reaches the inlet and induces a downstream flow transition from supersonic to subsonic. The temporal evolution of the unstart process has been visualized by high-speed schlieren imaging. The flow visualization shows a strong dependency of the unstarting flow on the local flow conditions, such as static/stagnation pressure gradients and boundary-layer thickness. The suction of 2–3% of the intake mass flow rate delays or pauses the inlet unstart process, and it reduces the restarting process hysteresis. The unstart process is either effectively ceased or marginally delayed, depending on the suction timing with respect to the unstart process.",58,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058495,"On the basis of the geometric similarity between polygons and circles, a bleed rate model of a supersonic inviscid circular hole is first established through a gradual approximation by regular polygons. The bleed mass-flow rate depends on the parameters at the entrance. A supersonic inviscid bleed choking model is further established by using the inflow Mach number and the pressure ratio when the expansion wave is parallel to the entrance. For a depthless hole at Mach 2.0 and with a pressure ratio of 0.5, the difference of flow coefficient predicted by the present model to that of computational fluid dynamics is 1.4% under nonchoking conditions. Under choking conditions with a pressure ratio of 0.1, the difference is 3.1%. Furthermore, the influence of the boundary layer on the bleed mass-flow rate is transformed into the influence of the displacement thickness on the effective size of the bleed hole. Based on that, the viscous bleed rate model is established, which shows a maximum error of 7.7% for a depthless bleed hole over laminar flow at Mach 4.0 and Reynolds number . Compared with the reported results of the full bleed hole, the difference of the bleed mass-flow rate predicted by the present model is 3.8%.",58,6

In this paper, large-eddy simulation (LES) has been used to investigate these jet installation effects. The simulations were performed on two jet configurations: an isolated jet and a jet installed below a horizontal flat plate. The LES is compared with experimental data from measurements using hot wires, unsteady surface pressure sensors, and far-field microphones. Good agreement has been achieved between LES and experimental measurements on flow statistics, space–time correlations, and both near-field and far-field sound spectra.

13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058636,"Noise reduction by screens applied to tandem cylinders was studied numerically. The screen was modeled by adding source terms to the Navier–Stokes equations. To validate the screen model, a windbreak installed on the ground and a cylinder covered by a perforated shroud were simulated. Good agreement between numerical and experimental results demonstrated its capability in predicting flow changed by screens. Subsequently, the screen model was applied to the tandem cylinders. Effects of screen porosity and location were investigated. When the screen was placed before the front cylinder, the noise was decreased by reducing local flow speed. The dominant frequency and sound pressure level reduced when the porosity decreased from 0.79 to 0.49. When the screen was placed between the two cylinders, the noise was reduced by weakening the vortex shedding and its strike on the rear cylinder. The screen is an effective tool for suppressing the noise from tandem cylinders. The noise reduction by screen can be reproduced by the present screen model.",58,6

In the simulation, the inflow Mach number is 0.17, and the Reynolds number based on the inflow velocity and the chord length of the airfoil is . Three angles of attack, which are 4, 5.5, and 8.5 deg, are computed. The time-averaged mean flow fields are compared with the experimental data, which include the velocity and spanwise vorticity profiles in the shear layer of the slat cove, the pressure coefficients on the surface of the airfoil. The dynamic pressure on the surface of the slat is sampled and compared with the experimental data by other researchers, and a good agreement is obtained. The far-field noise spectra, computed with the permeable Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings integration method, also agree well with the experimental data. The tone noise source is studied by analyzing the correlation between the dynamic pressure on the slat cove surface and the near-field noise. It is found that the tone noise is strongly correlated with the dynamic pressure close to the reattachment point on the slat cove surface.",58,6

The eigenequation and its partial derivative equation governing the coupled acoustic fields in the duct and backchamber are derived, from which the merging double eigenvalue is obtained at a target frequency for a single incident circumferential mode. The crucial liner parameters (namely. the chamber depth and the flow resistivity of the porous material) can be optimized simultaneously. A finite element propagation model is employed to evaluate the MMDM-based design for a finite-length liner, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method for selected typical design cases. It is found that mode merging can be realized for a nonlocally reacting liner, with or without a perforated plate, mainly for protecting the porous material inside its chamber. The MMDM, under the assumption of an infinite-length liner, can give an almost globally optimal design for a finite-length liner when the length exceeds five times the duct diameter. It is expected that the proposed MMDM can be useful in the preliminary designs for actual bulk liners due to its rapidness and accuracy.",58,6

Simulated results show that GFs increase the total pressure rise of the fan; the higher the GF height, the more notable the lifting capacity. The working point of the highest efficiency moves toward the large flow rate. GF0.5-100 extends the high-efficiency scope and increases efficiency by an average of 2.09%; and GF2-50R raises efficiency by an average of 1.12%. After implementing a GF, the dynamics in the impeller distinctly. Compared with the original fan, a secondary tip leakage vortex generated at the blade tip aggravates the leakage loss; a pair of shedding vortices generated in the downstream of the trailing edge promotes the pressure difference between the suction and pressure surfaces. The prediction with the large-eddy simulation method indicates that GFs heighten the aerodynamic noise of the fan, and GF0.5-100 and GF2-50R increase the sound pressure level by 12 and 13 dB, respectively. Although the GF0.5-100 and GF2-50R are preferred choices for such axial fans, some necessary measures should be taken to reduce the acoustic noise in practical applications.",58,6
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058207,"This study provides the first in-depth analysis of the formation, strength, and convection of cycloidal rotor tip vortices. The measurements of blade force and tip vortex using particle image velocimetry were conducted for different blade aspect ratios and pitch kinematics at a chord-based Reynolds number of 18,000. Particle image velocimetry was employed to investigate vortex development at increasing vortex ages and the early development for varying azimuthal locations. The instantaneous blade force measurements on the cycloidal rotor showed a decrease in nondimensional lift with decreasing blade aspect ratio. The aspect ratio of the blade did not affect the shape of the vortex convection trajectory. However, the rate of downward convection increased with increasing aspect ratio due to the higher thrust produced. The tip vortices showed self-similarity in the velocity and the circulation profiles. The measurements indicate that the vortex core experiences a logarithmic growth and the swirl velocity experiences a logarithmic decay due to viscous diffusion. The tip-vortex strength varied cyclically with blade azimuthal location due to the cyclic variation of blade pitch angle and the dynamic virtual camber effects. This periodic variation in the tip-vortex strength leads to a periodic variation in the induced flow velocity on the blade.",58,6

While the outer mold line shape determines aircraft aerodynamic characteristics, aircraft systems and passengers or payloads must fit inside. Emerging categories of aircraft, such as electric aircraft, are likely to experience new and critical spatial integration challenges. Existing aerodynamic shape optimization tools use a narrowly defined set of geometric constraints. However, no known aerodynamic optimization framework can handle spatial integration constraints derived directly from three-dimensional (3-D) geometry. A general geometric constraint formulation based on triangulated 3-D geometry is proposed. The constraint consists of two metrics: the length of the intersection curve(s) between any two objects, and the Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser function aggregated minimum distance. The proposed implementation of the intersection and distance computations is fast and analytically differentiable with respect to geometric design variables, making it suitable for efficient gradient-based optimization. The constraint formulation is validated using three Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based aerodynamic shape optimization problems: a 2-D fairing design problem, a 3-D fairing design problem, and the design of an aeroshell to surround a human avatar. It is shown that this approach is robust and efficient, enabling the aerodynamic optimization of bodies containing objects with arbitrary shapes.",58,6

Both methodologies use gradient-based optimization based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations driven by the discrete adjoint method. The first methodology uses a B-spline surface representation of the geometry coupled with free-form deformation and axial curve-based geometric control, as well an efficient linear elasticity-based mesh deformation method. The second methodology uses class-shape transforms for airfoil geometry control and either in-CAD or out-of-CAD surface modeling. Two benchmark geometries are used for comparison: a wing-body configuration representative of a large transport aircraft, and a wing-body configuration with aft-mounted nacelles typical of a small business jet. Both single-point and multipoint optimizations are performed. Cross validation is conducted such that flow evaluations are performed on the geometries produced by the two methodologies using a single flow solver and consistent meshes. It is found that both methodologies provide similar geometries and performance improvements. The primary differences that exist are a result of the distinct geometry parameterization and control methods that, in some cases, allow for more localized geometric control. The degree of agreement is indicative of the maturity that has been achieved by modern state-of-the-art aerodynamic shape optimization methodologies.",58,6

These two kinetic models satisfy the conservation laws; however, their predictions of the Prandtl number are inconsistent with that derived from the Boltzmann equation. A variety of modifications, such as Shakhov BGK (S-BGK), Ellipsoidal Statistical BGK (ES-BGK), Cubic Fokker–Planck (Cubic-FP), and Ellipsoidal Statistical Fokker–Planck (ES-FP), models have been proposed and they can provide correct Prandtl number. However, in the transition regime, the validity of simplified kinetic models is still controversial. In this work, the performance of four kinetic models is investigated through theoretical analysis and numerical comparison of the high-order moments beyond shear stress and heat flux. The simulations of the shock waves show that the results of these modified kinetic models deviate from the Boltzmann equation as Mach number increases. On the whole, the S-BGK model, which gives the most approximated relaxation coefficients for the production terms of high-order moments, provides the best predictions in the transition regime. For the ES-FP and Cubic-FP models, besides the incorrect relaxation coefficients, their deviations at large Mach numbers are further caused by inconstant Prandtl number and overestimated nonlinear terms, respectively.",58,6

All tests were conducted at a free stream Mach number of , the design Mach number for this inlet, and at both zero degrees angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS). The experiments were performed at various inlet operating conditions comprising supercritical, critical, and subcritical conditions that covered almost all ranges of the engine operating for this DSI. The results showed that the DSI had relatively acceptable performance characteristics when operating at its design condition. A symmetric supersonic flow pattern was observed at both supercritical and critical operating conditions of the present Y-shaped DSI. However, both symmetric and asymmetric supersonic flow patterns were observed during the subcritical operating conditions of the present inlet. At low subcritical operating conditions, the supersonic flow pattern remained symmetric, similar to that of the critical operating condition case. As the inlet experienced higher subcritical operating conditions, the supersonic flow structures became suddenly asymmetric and a new flow pattern was noticed. This flow pattern was seen to be highly unstable; and significant asymmetric shock wave oscillations, boundary-layer thickening, and shock-/boundary-layer interaction were observed for these situations. To the authors’ knowledge, this novel phenomenon of asymmetric flow behavior in a perfectly manufactured symmetric Y-shaped DSI encountering symmetric flow (0 deg AOA and AOS) has not been noticed by previous researchers and, if so, the results have not been published yet.",58,6

Because the flow physics is complex, a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) analysis is also desirable when performing optimization. A computationally efficient means of handling many-parameter optimization with expensive cost functions is to use gradient-based searches informed by an adjoint flow solution. In this work, a discrete adjoint method for high-speed flows is documented. It is implemented in the open-source compressible-flow solver Eilmer. One difficulty with extending a hypersonic flow solver to include an adjoint solver is the differentiation of complex, nonlinear (and sometimes nondifferentiable) algorithms. Here, it is shown that difficulty can be overcome using flow Jacobians constructed with finite differences based on complex variables. The coupled flow and adjoint solvers are packaged together with a gradient-based optimizer. The flow and adjoint solvers are verified and validated for high-speed RANS analysis.

SPOD is used to extract the coherent structures that correlate with the radiated sound by using an inner product based on a linearized disturbance energy. Two types of structures are prominent in the data. The first type arises in the jet’s shear layer and is linked to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, which is an important mechanism of sound generation in nonreacting jets. These structures produce sound through deformation of the flame front in the shear layer. They contain most of the acoustic energy and are dominant at Strouhal numbers (defined based on the jet’s diameter and the inlet mean velocity) less than unity. The second type of structures is found near the jet centerline, where large fluctuations of the flame surface are observed. The structures are linked to small nonlinear flame dynamics and to the Orr mechanism. They travel at a speed close to the inlet mean velocity and are important at higher Strouhal numbers. Regardless of their energy content, both types of structures have important contributions to the broadband nature of combustion noise.",58,6

The measurements included particle image velocimetry (PIV), high-speed CH* chemiluminescent imaging, and dynamic pressure signals. The paper focuses on the dynamic phenomenon of the period doubling bifurcation, which came about when the equivalence ratio of undiluted flames was enriched from 0.55 to 0.60 under constant Reynolds number . The bifurcation featured an emergence of an aerodynamically related timescale in addition to the fundamental timescale that was induced from an unstable acoustic eigenmode. The aerodynamic timescale is introduced by azimuthal convection of a high-heat-release-rate region and is linked in the literature with a precessing motion of the recirculation zone. It was found that on increasing the diluent molar fraction up to 50%, the amplitude and the frequency of the limit cycle fundamental acoustic mode decreased. A mechanism to interpret this suppression is that increasing the diluent molar fraction of the fuel makes the flame more susceptible to quenching because the extinction strain rate of the mixture is decreased. The paper argues that the existence of inert diluents in the fuel can significantly alter the dynamic state of the combustor, because the anchoring locations of the flame greatly depend on the composition-sensitive extinction strain rate of the mixture.",58,6
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058943,"This paper presents a physics-based data-driven method to learn predictive reduced-order models (ROMs) from high-fidelity simulations and illustrates it in the challenging context of a single-injector combustion process. The method combines the perspectives of model reduction and machine learning. Model reduction brings in the physics of the problem, constraining the ROM predictions to lie on a subspace defined by the governing equations. This is achieved by defining the ROM in proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) coordinates, which embed the rich physics information contained in solution snapshots of a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics model. The machine learning perspective brings the flexibility to use transformed physical variables to define the POD basis. This is in contrast to traditional model reduction approaches that are constrained to use the physical variables of the high-fidelity code. Combining the two perspectives, the approach identifies a set of transformed physical variables that expose quadratic structure in the combustion governing equations and learns a quadratic ROM from transformed snapshot data. This learning does not require access to the high-fidelity model implementation. Numerical experiments show that the ROM accurately predicts temperature, pressure, velocity, species concentrations, and the limit-cycle amplitude, with speedups of more than five orders of magnitude over high-fidelity models. Our ROM simulation is shown to be predictive 200% past the training interval. ROM-predicted pressure traces accurately match the phase of the pressure signal and yield good approximations of the limit-cycle amplitude.",58,6

In the absence of cyclic symmetry, the finite element method (FEM) requires a vast amount of computational costs for predicting the dynamic characteristics of mistuned systems. To greatly reduce the computational costs of FEM, various reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed. However, most existing ROMs are only effective for small mistuning or large mistuning situations. To resolve more complicated mistuning problems, this paper proposes two new approaches for blisks with both small mistuning and large mistuning. The first method extends the idea of the subset of nominal modes (SNM), in which modes of a largely mistuned system with small mistuning can be represented in terms of a subset of the pseudo-nominal system modes (SPNM). Because SPNM has to use system-level modes and calculation, the second method, called remaining damaged interface decomposition (HRDID), is further proposed, which is based on the basic principle of SPNM. It requires only sector-level modes and calculation. Furthermore, SPNM, HRDID, and FEM are used separately to calculate both the natural frequencies and mode shapes of mistuned academic blisks. The results of SPNM and HRDID are compared separately with those calculated by FEM to verify their accuracy. Finally, statistical analysis is performed to investigate the effect of random mistuning on a pseudo-nominal system.",58,6

Multilevel fast multipole method (MLFMA) is employed in the solution of the scattering and adjoint problem. The accuracy and reliability of the adjoint approach are verified with a double-ogive model. Optimizations considering aerodynamic, stealth, and aerodynamic/stealth performance of a blended-wing–body aircraft with a gradient-based optimizer are conducted. Stealth optimization results indicate that a small leading-edge radius and curvature on the forepart are beneficial to RCS reduction. Aerodynamic performance of aerodynamic optimized model and aero/stealth optimization result are comparable, but stealth performance of aero/stealth optimized result is inferior to stealth optimization. Conflictions between small leading edge and drag reduction are not very prominent based on the current study, whereas curvature is harmful to aerodynamic performance.",58,6
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058959,"There are two types of aeroelastic instabilities: divergence and flutter. Flutter is an oscillatory loss of stability, whereas transition to divergence occurs at zero frequency; that is, it is a static instability. A general divergence mechanism described in textbooks consists of a decrease of one of the natural frequencies down to zero due to negative aerodynamic stiffness, coalescence with its paired frequency, and (after the coalescence) transformation to one damped and one growing frequency. Most examples of this mechanism use quasi-steady aerodynamics that, at first sight, is suitable for divergence analyses because of its static nature. In this study, it is shown that, when using unsteady aerodynamics (Theodorsen theory), the analytical structure of eigenfrequencies essentially changes; namely, no frequency coalescence occurs but “structural” eigenfrequencies become damped. The divergence mode is not a continuation of a natural mode, but it separates from a continuous spectrum that exists in the aeroelastic system due to the wake behind the wing when unsteady aerodynamics is used but is absent in the quasi-steady case.",58,6
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059024,"Ensuring adequate flutter margins is a critical step in aircraft design. However, in the presence of nonlinear effects, subcritical limit-cycle oscillations can arise even before flutter occurs. When nonlinear effects are anticipated, postflutter analyses have to be integrated into aircraft design in addition to flutter computations for preventing this undesirable subcritical behavior. Therefore, there is a need for computationally fast postflutter analysis methods suitable for design applications. This paper investigates a data-driven method to forecast the bifurcation behavior of a geometrically nonlinear wing, demonstrating its suitability to analyze realistic nonlinear aeroelastic systems. The method efficiently forecasts postflutter responses using only a few system transient computations in the preflutter regime. First, the accuracy of forecasted bifurcation diagrams is verified against time-marching results. Next, wing design parameters are varied to investigate their impact on postflutter responses and show the method suitability to parametric studies.",58,6

Because of the manufacturing and loading imperfections, a significant variation was observed between experimental and theoretical buckling load. The current design criteria use a knockdown factor to estimate the buckling load of thin-walled structures. However, the design criteria employed a very conservative knockdown factor, because it is difficult to be accurately predicted. To improve the certainty of the knockdown factor, in this paper, a physics-informed artificial neural network (PANN) was employed to predict the thin-walled cylinder buckling load using experimental data collected by Seide. PANN has the potential to improve prediction and enforce some physical laws. A beam problem was presented to demonstrate the PANN capability. Then, the cylinder buckling analysis was carried out with PANN. An inequality constraint was applied to force the neural-network-predicted buckling load to be equal or smaller than the corresponding experimental data. The result shows that PANN can reach excellent prediction accuracy and is able to predict the buckling load equal to or smaller than the corresponding experimental buckling load. Additionally, both ANN and PANN are able to take the unique influential parameters as inputs and do not have presumed expression and thus have the potential to yield a less conservative prediction than the statistical equation.",58,6
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059106,"The numerical investigation of the stochastic aeroelastic characteristics of conventional and tow-steered composite laminates subjected to random uncertainties affecting the laminate fiber volume is addressed in the present paper. A computationally efficient stochastic model is constructed combining the semi-analytical Rayleigh–Ritz approach with the Karhunen–Loève discretization of the two-dimensional random field representing the fiber volume. In addition, polynomial chaos expansions are used as stochastic metamodels of the output random variables characterizing the onset of aeroelastic instability and the mass of the laminate. Such a metamodeling approach enables to alleviate the computational cost involved in the estimation of the statistics of the output variables of interest based on Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, the study encompasses both subsonic and supersonic flow conditions, for which two appropriate aerodynamic models are used. The numerical results provide effective uncertainty quantification in a variety of simulation scenarios, which are found to be useful for the incorporation of uncertainty quantification in the design of aircraft and spacecraft structures when uncertainties induced by the manufacturing process must be dealt with.",58,6
