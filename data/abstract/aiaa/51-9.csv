Since the inception of multidisciplinary design optimization, various methods (architectures) have been developed and applied to solve multidisciplinary design-optimization problems. This paper provides a survey of all the architectures that have been presented in the literature so far. All architectures are explained in detail using a unified description that includes optimization problem statements, diagrams, and detailed algorithms. The diagrams show both data and process flow through the multidisciplinary system and computational elements, which facilitate the understanding of the various architectures, and how they relate to each other. A classification of the multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures based on their problem formulations and decomposition strategies is also provided, and the benefits and drawbacks of the architectures are discussed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. For each architecture, several applications to the solution of engineering-design problems are cited. The result is a comprehensive but straightforward introduction to multidisciplinary design optimization for nonspecialists and a reference detailing all current multidisciplinary design-optimization architectures for specialists.",51,9

To find an approximate solution, the coefficient matrix is regularized by adding a small positive value to its diagonal terms. A regularized matrix is provided in different expressions that depend on the coefficient matrix. This paper regularizes a rectangular coefficient matrix and then a square coefficient matrix. Improvement of solution accuracy is possible by removing the very small singular values. Therefore, rank estimation of the coefficient matrix is a key to obtaining an accurate solution. This paper gives a method that estimates the rank by setting an appropriate value of . Numerical examples show that the proposed method is effective for system identification.",51,9
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051525,"Passive cylindrical disturbance generators mounted near the leading edge of an airfoil significantly improved its performance under dynamic stall conditions. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry and simultaneous pressure measurements were conducted at the midchord of a pitching airfoil equipped with passive disturbance generators. The disturbance generators were effective in reducing the strength of the dynamic stall vortex and therefore the negative pitching moment peak and hysteresis effects. When the disturbance generators were applied, the flow separation type was altered from leading- to trailing-edge stall. In contrast to the clean case, reattachment was initiated immediately after the separation reached the leading-edge region. In addition to the circular shape, also backward- and forward-wedge-shaped disturbance generators were investigated. Although the backward wedge also showed favorable results, the forward wedge was less successful. The shape of the disturbance generators appears to have a strong influence on the effectiveness of reducing the negative impact of dynamic stall, depending on the sense of rotation of a pair of weak trailing vortices.",51,9

An uncertainty analysis covering the most relevant precision and bias errors was performed, and uncertainty related to the jet-center location was found to be dominant. An initial analysis of the data revealed some of the effects of swirl on hastening jet evolution. The measurements were compared with data from previous studies, and were found to be in good agreement. The range of conditions measured and the characterization of the data quality make the data set useful for guiding future experimental studies and for validating numerical approaches capable of capturing the effects of swirl on turbulence.",51,9
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051832,"A modified linear-membrane formulation for the analysis of orthotropic axisymmetric shells is presented to assess the stresses and deformations in the torus and multitorus after pressurization. The multitorus is a conformable toroidal pressure vessel consisting of multiple articulated pressurizable toroids. It is shown that the displacement field of the toroidal membrane is nonsingular when the strains are not uniform and equal over the entire toroidal membrane. Solutions are obtained by formulating a linearized potential-energy functional, which is solved by use of the Ritz method. The modified linear-membrane formulation for pressurized isotropic shells was developed by J. T. Tielking, and this paper outlines the extension to orthotropic shells. The linearization results from the insensitivity of the meridional stress resultant to the deformation. The modified linear toroidal membrane solution is used as a tool to design a multitorus that behaves predictably with respect to stresses and deformations. This work provides an in-depth knowledge of the stresses and deformations of stiff inflatable toroidal structures that are of interest for applications such as inflatable space habitats, pressure cabins, and tanks.",51,9
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051922,"This paper describes a method to detect three-dimensional, steady inviscid shock waves from computational fluid dynamics data. The method is based on the principle that the collision of the characteristics of the same family causes the generation of a shock wave in a two-dimensional flow. In a three-dimensional flowfield, however, there is an infinite number of characteristics. Therefore, the plane on which the streamline can be treated locally as a planar curve is introduced, and the characteristic as an intersection between the Mach cone and this plane is defined. As a result, the shock waves in a three-dimensional, steady flowfield can be treated by a similar methodology as that in a two-dimensional flowfield.",51,9
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052007,"A numerical investigation is performed on the interference effects in single or biplane flapping airfoil propulsion in the presence of a stationary downstream tail. At a Reynolds number of 1000, this corresponds to the regime of small micro aerial vehicles. The objective of this study is to provide insight into the complex wing–tail interaction effects occurring in flapping-wing propulsion configurations. The effect of the relative distance between the airfoils, as well as the positioning and incidence angle of the tail, is investigated. Adding a tail behind a single flapping airfoil increases the efficiency and average thrust by up to 10 and 25%, respectively. For the biplane flapping airfoils without tail, overall efficiency and average thrust per airfoil increase up to 17 and 126%, respectively, with respect to the single airfoil due to the formation of a strong momentum jet. The effect of adding a tail behind the biplane flapping airfoils depends on the tail’s orientation and location. Increasing the incidence angle of the tail generates higher lift, although at the expense of decreased efficiency and thrust. Lastly, shifting the vertical position of the tail to have it coincide with the middle heaving position of the leading top airfoil gives the best overall performance.",51,9
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052041,"Drag reduction is important to improving the performance of scramjet engines operating at high Mach numbers. One demonstrated method for reducing skin-friction drag on a surface exposed to hypersonic flow is the injection and combustion of hydrogen fuel in the boundary layer. However, there are other fuels of interest in scramjet applications, and the underlying mechanisms that drive the reduction of skin friction are not well understood. An existing analytical model for boundary-layer combustion of hydrogen is rederived for a general fueling condition and then extended to allow investigation of the underlying flow physics in this model. Applying this theory to ethylene fueling indicates that skin-friction reduction through boundary-layer combustion is possible with fuels other than hydrogen. Analysis of the modeled boundary-layer profiles demonstrates that skin-friction reduction is accomplished through several coupled mechanisms: a change in near-wall viscosity, density changes and combustion act to reduce Reynolds stresses, and the low-momentum fuel stream thickens the boundary layer and changes the wall-normal velocity gradient. Finally, the theory is used to estimate the maximum fraction of fuel that should be used for skin-friction reduction in a typical scramjet engine.",51,9
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052062,"In this study, the standard and the modified Spalart–Allmaras one-equation turbulence models are implemented in a numerical solver to assess their effectiveness in describing the coolant flow in curved rocket engine cooling channels. Comparison with published experimental data has demonstrated that, in the case of curvature, the modified turbulence model improves the prediction of the skin friction but not of the heat transfer with respect to the standard one. Then, the analysis of two sample test cases inspired by the cooling circuit of the space shuttle main engine have shown that the standard Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model can be profitably used to describe the coolant flowfield and heat transfer.",51,9
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052139,"The work toward reusable single-stage-to-orbit launch-vehicle concepts has initiated several research activities toward a suitable nozzle design, which (unlike bell nozzles) is expected to perform optimally over the entire flight regime. Of these concepts, the annular aerospike nozzle and its variants, linear and truncated, are among the most promising. Given the concern over the intensity of acoustic loading during takeoff, it is vital to carry out a detailed aeroacoustic characterization of aerospike nozzles with special attention to overexpanded conditions, which are generally encountered during liftoff. In this work, an experimental investigation into aeroacoustics of an annular aerospike nozzle of design Mach number of 2.0 has been carried out, and the results are presented. The effect of truncation of the aerospike to 40 and 60% of the spike length on the acoustic field is also studied and compared with the full-length aerospike. Results show that, in the overexpansion regime, truncated conical aerospike nozzles have reduced acoustic levels until wake closure compared to the full-length aerospike and conventional convergent–divergent nozzle, all operating at identical conditions. This noise reduction is predominantly in the region upstream of the nozzle exit. At the peak radiation angle ( from the jet upstream direction), the acoustic levels are almost same for all of the nozzles investigated in the present study.",51,9

The steady flow is governed by the three-dimensional compressible Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes equations combined with a two-equation turbulence model. Block flexible variants of the generalized minimal residual method are Krylov methods designed for the solution of linear systems with multiple right-hand sides allowing variable preconditioning. Then, they can be applied to the discrete adjoint equations of Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for all objective and constraint functions as a right-hand side. The paper focuses on the development of a new algorithm combining the three following features: flexibility, multiple right-hand-side concurrent processing, and spectral deflation. This latter property enables to recycle approximate spectral information from one restart to the next one in order to avoid generalized minimal residual stagnation when short restart recurrences are performed. This novel block method is named block flexible generalized minimal residual with deflated restarting. It is evaluated on two aerodynamic configurations showing its capabilities to reduce computational times over standard Krylov methods.",51,9
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052141,"The evolution and control of a two-dimensional wave packet developing on a flat plate with a leading edge is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation. The aim is to identify and suppress the wave packets generated by freestream perturbations. A sensor is placed close to the wall to detect the upcoming wave packet, while an actuator is placed further downstream to control it. A plasma actuator is modeled as an external forcing on the flow using a model based and validated on experimental investigations. A linear quadratic Gaussian controller is designed, and an output projection is used to build the objective function. Moreover, by appropriate selection of the proper orthogonal decomposition modes, we identify the disturbances to be damped. A reduced-order model of the input–output system is constructed by using system identification via the eigensystem realization algorithm. A limitation of the plasma actuators is the unidirectional forcing of the generated wall jet, which is predetermined by the electrodes’ location. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing and comparing two different solutions: 1) introducing an offset in the control signal such that the resulting total forcing is oriented along one direction, and 2) using two plasma actuators acting in opposite directions. The results are compared with the ideal case where constraints are not accounted for the control design. We show that the resulting controllers based on plasma actuators can successfully attenuate the amplitude of the wave packet developing inside the boundary layer.",51,9
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052175,"The normal shock wave/boundary-layer interaction is important to the operation and performance of a supersonic inlet, and the normal shock wave/boundary-layer interaction is particularly prominent in external compression inlets. To improve understanding of such interactions, it is helpful to make use of fundamental flows that capture the main elements of inlets, without resorting to the level of complexity and system integration associated with full-geometry inlets. In this paper, several fundamental flowfield configurations have been considered as possible test cases to represent the normal shock wave/boundary-layer interaction aspects found in typical external compression inlets, and it was found that the spillage diffuser more closely retains the basic flow features of an external compression inlet than the other configurations. In particular, this flowfield allows the normal shock Mach number as well as the amount and rate of subsonic diffusion to all be held approximately constant and independent of the application of flow control. In addition, a survey of several external compression inlets was conducted to quantify the flow and geometric parameters of the spillage diffuser relevant to actual inlets. The results indicated that such a flow may be especially relevant if the terminal Mach number is about 1.3 to 1.4, the confinement parameter is around 10%, and the width is around twice or three times the height. In addition, the area expansion downstream of the shock should be limited to the conservative side of incipient stall based on incompressible diffusers.",51,9
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052093,This paper describes thin-wing vibration control using an array of small flexible rectangular polymer fins attached near the leading edge on the upper wing surface to manipulate unsteady flow structures. Dynamic aeroelastic deformation of a rectangular flat-plate wing and motions of the fins relative to the wing are measured by using a high-speed videogrammetric system in a low-speed wind tunnel. The major vibration modes of the baseline wing and the wing with the fins are extracted. It is found that wing vibration particularly near the dominant first torsion mode is considerably suppressed by the flexible fins interacting with highly unsteady separated flows in the ranges of the freestream velocities and angles of attack. Global velocity measurements indicate that the fins significantly reduce the unsteadiness of the separated flow on the wing. The physical mechanisms behind the vibration suppression with the flexible fins are explored based on the analysis of the measured data.,51,9
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052215,"A new deformation shape-sensing methodology is investigated for the purposes of real-time condition assessment, control, and health monitoring of flexible lightweight aerospace structures. The fiber optic strain sensing technology was recently proposed by the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. The methodology implements the use of fiber optic sensors to obtain strain measurements from the target structure and to estimate the corresponding displacement field. In this paper, the methodology is investigated through an experimental aluminum winglike swept-plate model. The proposed algorithm is implemented for three distinct loading cases and compared to a well-established modal-based shape-estimation algorithm. The estimation results from both methods are also compared to reference displacements from photogrammetry and computational analyses. The estimation error for each method is quantified using the root-mean-square measure, and the range of validity of the approach for damage detection is established. Furthermore, the disadvantages and the advantages of each method are discussed, demonstrating the additional benefits of using the proposed fiber optic strain sensing methodology to achieve a robust method for monitoring ultra-lightweight flying wings or next-generation commercial airplanes.",51,9
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052264,"A high-order discretization and filtering procedure is applied to the solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in a vorticity/stream-function formulation, which is implemented in curvilinear coordinates. Compact finite differencing is coupled with the use of a low-pass filtering operator to augment the stability of the scheme for high-Reynolds-number flows and/or low-resolution meshes. Advancement in time is done through either first- or second-order, backward Euler time integrations, which are supplemented with Newton-like subiterations. Temporal and spatial formal orders of accuracy are examined through exact solutions of the governing equations, where the theoretical orders of accuracy are achieved for up to sixth-order spatial and second-order temporal discretizations. The technique is also demonstrated on both steady and unsteady incompressible flow canonical problems, including the lid-driven cavity and unsteady flow over a cylinder. The advantage of the high-order scheme coupled with the filter becomes apparent from more accurate solutions being achievable on much coarser meshes.",51,9
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052299,"The sloshing effects of an internal fluid on the flutter envelope of an aeroelastic system have received little attention in the open literature. This issue is nevertheless relevant for many aircraft, especially high-performance fighter jets carrying stores. This paper addresses some aspects of this problem as well as related modeling and analysis issues. These include the importance or insignificance of accounting for the hydroelastic effect when modeling an internal fluid and its container as well as accounting for that container when modeling the aerodynamics of the overall aeroelastic system. The paper also reports on the findings of four independent sets of flutter analyses performed for a wing–store test configuration and various fuel fill levels in the subsonic, transonic, and early supersonic regimes. Two of these sets of numerica l experiments relied on a computational-fluid-dynamics-based computational technology, and two of them on the doublet-lattice method or a supersonic lifting-surface theory, where applicable. The geometry of the chosen test configuration is that of the AGARD Wing 445.6 with a blunt-nosed store. The obtained computational results show that, at least for the considered wing–store configuration, ignoring the aforementioned hydroelastic effect tends to overestimate the added-mass effect and underestimate the critical pressure and flutter speed. They also reveal that, whereas the aerodynamics of the store may be neglected in the subsonic regime, they cannot be ignored in supersonic air streams. Finally, the performed computational study suggests that, in general, the critical pressure and flutter speed decrease with an increasing fuel fill level.",51,9
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052327,"A reliability-based optimization method under both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties is studied. The mixed uncertainties are analyzed by combined probability and evidence theory. If the mixed uncertainty analysis is directly embedded in reliability-based optimization to quantify the uncertain features of each search point, it would be computationally prohibitive. To address this problem, a sequential optimization and mixed uncertainty analysis method is proposed to decompose the reliability-based optimization problem into separate deterministic optimization and mixed uncertainty analysis subproblems, which are solved sequentially and alternately until convergence is achieved. The research focus is how to transform the reliability-based optimization problem into its quasi-equivalent deterministic formulation according to the information obtained in the uncertainty analysis. It is proposed to first decompose the total reliability target into each focal element of the epistemic uncertainties, so as to simplify the complex mixed uncertainty problem into several mixed probability and single-interval subproblems. In each focal element, the algorithm to transform the uncertain objective and constraint into the quasi-equivalent deterministic formulations is developed by extending the existing probabilistic performance measure approach with probability and evidence theory. The effectiveness and efficiency of the sequential optimization and mixed uncertainty analysis method are testified with one numerical example and one practical satellite conceptual design problem.",51,9
