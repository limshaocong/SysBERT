It has been suggested that the influence of the Reynolds number may be somewhat different for a jet subjected to pulsation when compared to an equivalent steady jet. A comparative study of both steady and pulsating jets is presented for a Reynolds number range from to . All the other factors that affect the flowfield are kept constant, which are , , and . It was found that for the range of the Reynolds numbers tested, pulsation results in a shortening of the jet core, the centerline axial velocity component declines more rapidly, and higher values of the radial velocity component for are observed. As the Reynolds number increases, the jet spreads more rapidly, the turbulent kinetic energy and nondimensional turbulent fluctuations decrease, and the flowfield near the impinging surface changes drastically, which is evident with the development of a turbulent momentum exchange interaction away from the wall for .",51,10
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051669,"In the information theory, entropy is a measure of the uncertainty associated with a random variable. To identify the important variables of a system subjected to many random variables, a novel entropy-based importance measure for random variables is proposed in this paper. The method evaluates the effect of a random variable on the output responses by calculating the change of the entropy value. This technique focuses on the influence of input uncertainty on the entropy of the output responses and can be easily extended to the case taking the correlations among the random variables into consideration. Besides, the effect of a random variable within any partial region of interest can also be evaluated by the proposed global sensitivity indicator. The mathematical properties of the proposed importance measure are investigated and proven in detail. Three simple numerical examples are employed to demonstrate the applicability of the new importance measure, and then a probabilistic risk assessment model is used to demonstrate the engineering application of the importance measure.",51,10

3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051766,"The use of plasma actuators for active transition control in a flat-plate boundary layer is studied numerically. The full unsteady two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved with a perturbation formulation using a finite volume discretization. The effect of the plasma actuator is modeled using generic as well as experimentally derived body force distributions. An adaptive control system based on the filtered- least-mean-squares algorithm is included within the simulations. The control system selects the optimum frequency, phase, and amplitude of the body force in order to attenuate Tollmien–Schlichting instability waves. The factors influencing the effectiveness of transition control are discussed. It is shown that the relative size of the instability wavelength and the spatial extent of the body force have a strong influence on control performance. It is also demonstrated that the experimentally derived force distributions produce suboptimal control performance when compared with generic body force distributions. This has implications for the design of plasma actuators for boundary-layer instability control.",51,10

This represents both the first flow-tagging velocity measurements and the first application of nitric-oxide planar laser-induced fluorescence flow visualization in an arcjet facility. Results are presented at selected facility run conditions, including some in a simulated Earth atmosphere (75% nitrogen, 20% oxygen, 5% argon) and others in a simulated Martian atmosphere (71% carbon dioxide, 24% nitrogen, 5% argon) for specific bulk enthalpies ranging from 6.5 to . Flow-visualization images reveal the presence of large-scale unsteady flow structures and indicate nitric-oxide fluorescence signal over more than 70% of the core flow for specific bulk enthalpies below about but over less than 10% of the core flow for specific bulk enthalpies above about . Axial velocimetry was performed using molecular tagging velocimetry. Axial velocities of about were measured along the centerline. Radial velocimetry was performed by scanning the wavelength of the narrowband laser and analyzing the resulting Doppler shift. Radial velocities of were measured.",51,10

These architectures seek to efficiently handle optimizations with computationally expensive analyses including multiple disciplines. A new testing procedure is proposed that can provide a quantitative and qualitative means of comparison among architectures. The proposed test procedure is implemented within the open-source framework, OpenMDAO, and comparative results are presented for five well-known architectures: multiple design feasible, individual design feasible, collaborative optimization, bilevel integrated systems synthesis, and bilevel integrated systems synthesis 2000. How using open-source software development methods can allow the multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization community to submit new problems and architectures to keep the test suite relevant is also demonstrated.",51,10
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052249,"The simulation of low-frequency unsteadiness in shock wave/turbulent boundary-layer interactions constitutes a challenging case insofar as very long time integrations are required to describe these broadband motions at frequencies two orders of magnitude lower than those of the turbulent motions. A relatively low-cost numerical strategy is established in the present study. The use of quasi-spectral centered finite differences in conjunction with high-order selective filtering provides an efficient method for compressible large-eddy simulations based on explicit filtering regularization. This strategy is extended to flows containing discontinuities by switching between the high-order filter used in regular zones and a low-order filter acting selectively near the shock locations. The accuracy of the current strategy is assessed for a developing turbulent supersonic boundary layer. The case of an oblique shock wave impinging on a flat plate is then successfully validated against previous experimental and numerical studies. The numerical strategy is finally applied to a configuration involving important low-frequency unsteadiness. A database covering dozens of low-frequency cycles is established to characterize the broadband nature of the low-frequency dynamics, which can be associated with a breathing motion of the decelerated zone. A particular attention is drawn to the important turbulent activity occurring at medium frequencies. It is shown that it corresponds to vortical structures shed in the developing shear layer. A frequency–wave number analysis of the wall pressure helps to identify their phase speed.",51,10
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052313,"Characterizing aerothermodynamic environments represents a significant challenge to aircraft operations. Hypersonic boundary-layer structure including transitions from laminar flow to turbulent flow is important to air vehicle design, thermal protection system design, and air vehicle in-flight control. Because the transition region cannot be observed directly, an inverse procedure must be formulated that relates transition region characteristics with parameters that can be measured. We propose a novel measurement system that leverages the hypersonic body-surface heating profile to locate the boundary-layer transition region. In this work, we focus on ultrasonic sensing as the measurement strategy, a three-dimensional conduction solution, and the extended Kalman filter for the inverse procedure. Development of the proposed measurement method is accomplished using simple, controlled experiments involving a high-heat flux step source on a large flat metal plate. Although the heating profile of the step source used in this work is somewhat similar in profile to the hypersonic transition region heating profile, the transition region may exhibit smaller gradients, nonuniform heating before and after the transition, and irregular shapes. Heating-source localization results and convergence behavior are compared for the extended Kalman filter and simulated one-way ultrasonic pulse measurements. Sensor-array pattern experiment results are presented for the sensor array. The extended Kalman filter was found to be robust and appropriate for applications where the user has control over some aspect of the environment that affects the parameters being estimated (e.g., throttle, attitude controls, etc.).",51,10
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052318,"This paper describes the development of a two-color fast-responding pressure-sensitive paint with temperature correction capability. This paint uses a platinum porphyrin compound as the pressure sensor with perylene as the reference sensor and a laser dye added to adjust the spectrum distribution and temperature sensitivity of the reference channel. Separate emission signals of the pressure and reference sensors can be captured by the red and green channels of a color camera, respectively. Temperature errors are counteracted by taking a ratio of ratios, whereas a correction parameter is introduced to compensate for the difference in temperature sensitivity of the two separate emissions. The green channel also has the potential to correct for illumination changes caused by model movement and deformation in a nonuniform illumination field, provided that there is no temperature change during the test, or the temperature change can be measured separately. This paint is fast enough to resolve pressure changes occurring at several kilohertz due to the high diffusivity of the porous polymer/ceramic binder.",51,10
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052333,"A flow-control study using steady suction and pulsed blowing in close proximity was conducted on an axisymmetric bluff body at length-based Reynolds numbers between 1.0 and . The study included a coupled incremental computational-fluid-dynamics and experimental approach. It began with computations of various model setup designs. Subsequently, flow-control experiments and computations were used to optimize steady suction alone. Finally, flow control was provided by a synchronized array of 28 suction and oscillatory blowing actuators, positioned slightly upstream of the baseline separation. Results show suction alone has a limited ability to delay separation and reduce drag on this geometry. Suction located far from the baseline separation is shown to actually increase drag. Addition of pulsed blowing enables separation delay to the trailing edge and drag to be nullified. Increased overall system efficiency, including estimated total actuator power invested, was found at low momentum input for optimally located steady suction and pulsed blowing. This was partially attributed to the particular geometry used because the active flow-control system shows a robust ability to delay separation. Not all measured trends were predicted by computation due to the complex nature of this configuration and the active flow-control system characteristics.",51,10
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052309,"The generation of reduced-order models for computing the unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamic loads on an aircraft from pitching motions in the transonic speed range is described. The models considered are based on Duhamel’s superposition integral using indicial (step) response functions, Volterra theory using nonlinear kernels, radial basis functions, and a surrogate-based recurrence framework, both using time-history simulations of a training maneuver(s). Results are reported for the X-31 configuration with a sharp leading-edge cranked delta wing geometry, including canard/wing vortex interactions. The validity of the various models studied was assessed by comparison of the model outputs with time-accurate computational-fluid-dynamics simulations of new maneuvers. Overall, the reduced-order models were found to produce accurate results, although a nonlinear model based on indicial functions yielded the best accuracy among all models. This model, along with a time-dependent surrogate approach, helped to produce accurate predictions for a wide range of motions in the transonic speed range.",51,10
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052357,"Adjoint optimization methods have proven successful for the control of turbulence and boundary layers and in the design of airfoils and aircraft. In this paper, the adjoint equations are extended to the problem of controlling steady, inviscid, supersonic flow with volumetric source terms in the Euler equations, that is, mass, momentum, and energy addition. The adjoint solutions are shown to indicate both the optimal location for the source placement and cost gradient. In the particular case of drag reduction by energy deposition, the gradient is proportional to energy efficiency and becomes a key factor in optimization. The general form of the problem makes these results applicable to all forms of volumetric control with the goals of drag reduction, lift enhancement, and the generation of pitching moments.",51,10
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052373,"The interaction of isentropic compression waves with a bow shock is numerically investigated. The relative intersection region size is introduced to characterize the convergence degree of isentropic compression waves. Among the multiple parameters involved, relative intersection region size is a crucial factor in determining the occurrence of the interference patterns, as well as the corresponding pressure and thermal loads. There exist two critical relative intersection region sizes: the small one corresponds to the intersection region size being approximately equal to the transmitted shock length in the case of Edney type IV interference, and the large one corresponds to the intersection region size being close to the transmitted shock length in the case of Edney type III interference. When relative intersection region size is lower than the small critical value, Edney interference patterns take place but their types depend on the vertical intersection location. When relative intersection region size is greater than the large critical value, none of the Edney interference patterns occurs. When relative intersection region size falls in between the two critical values, part of Edney interference patterns occur and a subsonic jet is produced by the intersection of isentropic compression waves with the strong portion of the bow shock. The maximum interference heating reduces with relative intersection region size. Additionally, a dimensionless dependence of the maximum heat transfer intensification was inferred for practical design and calculations.",51,10
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052384,"A two-dimensional hypersonic inlet/isolator model that exhibits self-starting characteristics is tested with different exit throttling ratios at a freestream Mach number of 5.9 in a shock tunnel. Various flow characteristics are observed and measured by applying simultaneous high-speed Schlieren imaging and surface pressure measurements. The results indicate that the backpressure generated by the throttling device can be tolerated, and the inlet can maintain the starting mode at low throttling ratios, whereas unstart flows are initiated from the near-choke throttling ratios, and a shock wave oscillation appears. The Schlieren movie demonstrates that the upstream-propagating shocks in the duct play important roles during the oscillation cycles and that the formations of the upstream-propagating shocks are related to the downstream-propagating compression waves/shock waves that encounter the throttling section. The frequency of the shock wave oscillation increases with increasing exit throttling ratios, primarily because of the acceleration of the upstream propagation.",51,10
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052391,"This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of the sound produced by flow interaction with a wall-mounted finite-length cylinder of circular or square cross section. Acoustic measurements have been taken in an anechoic wind tunnel at a range of flow speeds and for a wide variety of aspect ratios (cylinder length-to-diameter ratio). Unsteady velocity data have also been measured in the cylinder wake using hot-wire anemometry, and these data are related to far-field noise measurements to determine the flow mechanisms responsible for noise generation. The cylinder aspect ratio was found to be an important parameter that controls vortex shedding behavior and hence tonal noise generation. Multiple peaks in the noise spectra can be attributed to different vortex cells in the near wake, the number and strength of which are controlled by aspect ratio influencing flow over the tip or cylinder–wall junction.",51,10
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052432,"The formation of secondary flow structures due to the interaction of an array of three finite span synthetic jets with a crossflow was investigated experimentally over a finite swept-back wing (NACA 4421, , sweep angle of 30 deg, Reynolds number of ). Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry data were collected in the midspan section of the wing, where the effects of the jets’ combinations and their blowing ratios were analyzed based on the three-dimensional flowfield using time- and phase-averaged statistics. The focus of the present work was to capture the formation and advection of secondary flow structures in the vicinity of the synthetic jets for different combinations of jets, including 1) only the center jet activated, 2) two synthetic jets off the middle jet activated, and 3) all three synthetic jets actuated. An angle of attack of 13.5 deg was selected, in which the boundary layer was either attached (in the vicinity of the middle jet) or partially separated (in the vicinity of the jet closer to the wing tip). The time-averaged total velocity fields exhibited secondary streamwise structures that were formed along the jets orifice span. Furthermore, the effect of the synthetic jet(s) was felt at spanwise locations (toward the wing tip) away from the point of activation. From the phase-averaged flowfield, it was shown that, during the blowing portion of the synthetic jet cycle, quasi-two-dimensional pairs of counter-rotating spanwise rollers were formed at the jet exit plane. Each pair was advected downstream as time progressed, bent and tilted toward the tip, and eventually broke down into smaller structures farther downstream, which resulted in the formation of secondary streamwise structures.",51,10
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052436,"This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation exploring the noise-reduction potential of sawtooth trailing-edge serrations on a flat plate at low-to-moderate Reynolds number . Acoustic measurements have been taken using a flat plate with both sharp and serrated trailing edges in an anechoic wind tunnel. Trailing-edge serrations are found to achieve reductions of up to 13 dB in the narrowband noise levels, and this is mainly due to attenuation of vortex shedding at the trailing edge. Velocity data have also been measured in the very-near trailing-edge wake using hot-wire anemometry, and these data are related to the far-field noise measurements to give insight into the trailing-edge serration noise-reduction mechanism. The results show that, for this particular configuration, the noise-reduction mechanism of trailing-edge serrations is dominated by their influence on the hydrodynamic field at the source location. Therefore, the assumption that the turbulent field is unaffected by the serrations is not valid and explains why theory is not able to explain experimental observations.",51,10
