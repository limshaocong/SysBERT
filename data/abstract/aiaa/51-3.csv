0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051542,"This paper develops analytical methods for test resource allocation that aid in reducing the uncertainty in the system model prediction for multilevel and multidisciplinary systems. The various component, subsystem, and system-level model predictions; the corresponding inputs and calibration parameters; test data; and model and measurement errors are connected efficiently using a Bayesian network. This provides a unified framework for uncertainty analysis where test data can be integrated along with computational simulations. The Bayesian network is used in an inverse problem where the model parameters of multiple subsystems are calibrated simultaneously. This leads to a decrease in the variance of the model parameters, and hence, in the variance of the overall system performance prediction. An optimization-based procedure is then used for test resource allocation using the Bayesian network, and those tests that can effectively reduce the uncertainty in the system model prediction are identified. The proposed methods are extended to three types of aerospace systems-testing applications: structural dynamics (multilevel), thermally induced vibration/flutter (multidisciplinary), and simplified space telescope mirror (multilevel, multidisciplinary).",51,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051742,"This study investigates the influence, on aircraft wake vortex behavior, of atmospheres that are stably stratified (neutral to very strong) and weakly turbulent, by means of large-eddy simulations at very high Reynolds number and on relatively fine grids. The atmospheric fields are first generated using large-eddy simulations of forced and stratified turbulence reaching a statistically stationary state. The obtained fields are shown to be realistic and consistent with the literature. A pair of counter-rotating vortices, with relatively tight cores, is then put in the obtained fields and evolved. The evolution of the wake vortex topology, transport, and decay is analyzed in depth by measuring the wake vortex characteristics in all cross planes. The vortex transport and deformation are related to the stratification and turbulence levels. Stratification combined with weak turbulence is seen to strongly affect the Crow instability development. Different decay mechanisms are identified, related to the interactions with the turbulence, the turbulent baroclinic vorticity, and/or between the vortices themselves. Finally, improved simplified models of vortex altitude evolution and of vortex decay (with two phases) are proposed and calibrated on the present results. They yield good agreement with the large-eddy simulation results and are usefully integrated in our operational models.",51,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051801,"A nonlinear aeroelastic model suitable for flexible insectlike flapping wings in hover is presented. The aeroelastic model is obtained by coupling a nonlinear structural dynamic model based on MARC, with a potential-flow-based approximate aerodynamic model that consists of leading-edge vortices and a wake model. The aeroelastic response is obtained using an updated Lagrangian method. The paper describes validation studies conducted on the structural dynamic model, aerodynamic comparisons, and aeroelastic studies conducted on isotropic and anisotropic Zimmerman wings. The results demonstrate the suitability of MARC for modeling anisotropic wings undergoing insectlike wing kinematics. For the aeroelastic cases considered, the approximate model shows acceptable agreement with computational-fluid-dynamics-based and experimental results. The approximate model captured several important trends correctly.",51,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051875,"In order to reduce the shock-wave drag and aerodynamic heating of hypersonic vehicles effectively a new concept of non-ablative thermal protection system was proposed based on the idea of flowfield reconstruction. In this non-ablative thermal protection system a spike-blunt body structure and lateral jets are combined together to realize the flowfield modification. The spike transforms the bow shock into a conical shock, and the lateral jets increase the angle of conical shock wave and keep it away from the blunt body to avoid severe shock/shock interactions. Flow visualizations and pressure measurements were conducted in a hypersonic wind tunnel at Mach number 6 to demonstrate this concept. Numerical simulations were also carried out. Both experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the non-ablative thermal protection system works well for shock-wave drag reduction and thermal protection. The peak pressure at the reattachment region is reduced by 65% even under 4 deg attack angle by the lateral jet. Experimental data also show that the working pressure of lateral jets is much lower than that of forward-facing jets at the stagnation point. All the results show that the engineering application of non-ablative thermal protection system appears to be quite promising.",51,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051912,"This work seeks to provide a closed-form analytical solution for the transverse vorticoacoustic wave in a circular cylinder with headwall injection. This particular configuration mimics the conditions leading to the onset of traveling radial and tangential waves in an idealized liquid rocket engine. Assuming a short cylindrical chamber with two injection showerhead models (a top hat, uniform flow, and a bell-shaped sinusoidal profile), regular perturbations are used to linearize the problem’s conservation equations. Flow decomposition is subsequently applied to the first-order disturbance equations, thus giving rise to a compressible, inviscid, acoustic set that is responsible for driving the unsteady motion, and to an incompressible, viscous, vortical set that is driven by virtue of coupling with the acoustic mode along solid boundaries. While the acoustic mode is readily recovered from the wave equation, the induced vortical mode is resolved using boundary-layer theory and a judicious expansion of the rotational equations with respect to a small viscous parameter, . After some effort, an explicit formulation is arrived at for each of the uniform and bell-shaped injection profiles. The two solutions are then presented, verified numerically, and compared at fixed spatial locations within the chamber. The penetration depth of the unsteady boundary layer is also characterized. Unlike the solution based on uniform headwall injection, the vorticoacoustic wave based on the bell-shaped mean flow is found to be more realistic; being capable of securing the no-slip requirement at both headwall and sidewall boundaries.",51,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051924,"This paper presents a new formulation and computational solution of an optimal control problem concerning unsteady shock wave attenuation. The adjoint system of equations for the unsteady Euler system in one dimension is derived and used in an adjoint-based solution procedure for the optimal control. A novel algorithm is used to satisfy all necessary first-order optimality conditions while locally minimizing an appropriate cost functional. Distributed control solutions with certain physical constraints are calculated for attenuating blast waves similar to those generated by ignition overpressure from the shuttle’s solid rocket booster during launch. Results are presented for attenuating shocks traveling at Mach 1.5 and 3.5 down to 85%, 80%, and 75% of the uncontrolled wave’s driving pressure. The control solutions give insight into the magnitude and location of energy dissipation necessary to decrease a given blast wave’s overpressure to a set target level over a given spatial domain while using only as much control as needed. The solution procedure is sufficiently flexible such that it can be used to solve other optimal control problems constrained by partial differential equations that admit discontinuities and have fixed initial data and free final data at a free final time.",51,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051925,"This paper presents the experimental results on the mixing of a hollow-cone spray with a confined crossflow. The experiments were carried out inside a rectangular duct ( in the cross section) at the ambient temperature and pressure with different spray and crossflow conditions, different injection angles, and different nozzle numbers (single and double). The criteria number, , which can well evaluate the spray-crossflow mixing effect was defined. A better mixing can be achieved with proper . The upper and bottom counter-rotating vortex pair structures were observed to dominate the mixing and strongly influence the mixing behaviors. For the double nozzle, more counter-rotating vortex pair structures are caused, and their sizes and strength become smaller than that of the single nozzle, which is beneficial for mixing. The spray direction along the crossflow also contributed to the mixing enhancement. The mixing optimization is realized with proper and spray injection angles.",51,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051935,"The influence of periodic excitation from synthetic jet actuators on boundary-layer separation and reattachment over a NACA 0025 airfoil at a low Reynolds number is studied. Flow-visualization results showed a vertical jet pulse accompanied by two counter-rotating vortices being produced at the exit of the simulated slot, with the vortices shed at the excitation frequency. Hot-wire measurements determined the maximum jet velocity for a range of excitation frequencies and voltages, and were used to characterize the excitation amplitude in terms of the momentum coefficient . With the synthetic jet actuator installed in the airfoil, flow-visualization results showed that excitation produces boundary-layer reattachment, with the associated significant reduction in wake width. Wake-velocity measurements were performed to characterize the effect of flow-control excitation amplitude and frequency on airfoil drag and wake topology. The results demonstrate that is the primary governing flow-control parameter. Applying excitation above a specific threshold produced a 50% reduction in drag, significantly affecting wake topology. However, power consumption of a piezoelectric synthetic jet actuator depends substantially on the excitation frequency. Hence, by varying excitation frequency, significant gains in efficiency are possible.",51,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051958,"This paper deals with the acoustic velocity field simulation generated by interaction of flow with moving bodies. Starting from the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation, an analytical formulation of the acoustic velocity is derived for sources in arbitrary motion. This makes the imposition of the boundary condition on a (rigid) scattering surface much more straightforward, as, if the traditional pressure formulation is used, then the pressure gradient must be calculated. Computational results for a pulsating sphere, dipole source, and a propeller case with subsonic tips verify this formulation.",51,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052008,"This paper explores the effectiveness of the recently developed surrogate modeling method, the Adaptive Hybrid Functions, when applied in conjunction with different sampling techniques and different sample sizes. The Adaptive Hybrid Functions is a hybrid surrogate modeling method that seeks to exploit the advantages of each component surrogate. To explore its effectiveness, the Adaptive Hybrid Functions is applied to model four disparate complex engineering systems, namely: 1) wind farm power generation, 2) product platform planning (for universal electric motors), 3) three-pane window heat transfer, and 4) onshore wind farm cost estimation. The effectiveness of the following three distinct sampling techniques is investigated: 1) Latin hypercube sampling, 2) Sobol’s quasi-random sequence, and 3) the Hammersley sequence sampling. Cross-validation is used to evaluate the accuracy of the resulting surrogate models. It was observed that the Sobol’s sequence and the Latin hypercube sampling techniques provided better accuracy in the case of high-dimensional problems, whereas the Hammersley sequence sampling technique performed better in the case of low-dimensional problems. It was further observed that a monotonic increase in modeling accuracy is not necessarily accomplished by simply increasing the sample size for different problems. Overall, the Adaptive Hybrid Functions provided acceptable to high accuracy in representing complex system behavior.",51,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052029,"Plasma is a dynamic optical medium with potential applications in the field of aero-optics for wavefront control. The objective is to develop “plasma adaptive optic” devices which rely upon the relationship between plasma electron density and index of refraction. The advantages of plasma adaptive optic devices are that they have no moving parts and can have temporal responses two orders of magnitude higher than the fastest deformable mirror. Therefore, plasma adaptive optic devices have the potential to be more robust, less subject to fatigue, and faster than conventional technology. Experimental results and a theoretical model are presented which investigate the spatial distribution of the plasma inside a cylindrical plasma adaptive optic lens. The experiment reveals two distinct plasma formation regimes that occur depending on the lens geometry. The theoretical model is used to help identify the geometric parameters required to produce each plasma regime. The excellent agreement between the experiment and theory provides a scaling relation for the cylindrical plasma adaptive optic lens. This scaling relation is necessary for the future design of an array of plasma adaptive optics to provide spatial wavefront corrections for aero-optic applications.",51,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052058,"The effect of screech tones on the broadband shock-associated noise of underexpanded jets is investigated experimentally. Screech is removed by means of a notched nozzle, and the properties of the broadband shock-associated noise in the screech-free configuration are compared to that in a screeching flow. It is first demonstrated that the suppressing technique used is nonintrusive in that it does not alter the shock-cell structure of the jet plume. It is then shown that screech has an effect on the aerodynamics of the jet, which induces changes in the broadband shock-associated noise. Indeed, screech accelerates the damping of the shock-cell pattern, leading to an attenuation of the broadband shock-associated noise and a shifting of this noise component to higher frequencies. Moreover, a tuning between the peak frequency of the broadband shock-associated noise and the screech frequency is observed. It is also deduced from the directivity of the broadband shock-associated noise in the far field that the convective velocity in the shear layer is modified in the presence of screech tones.",51,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052021,"The basic flow phenomenon of a hot jet ejected transversely into a cold cross flow is investigated on a generic air-system outlet of an aircraft. Because standard statistical turbulence models cannot properly account for the mixing and because of the high Reynolds number of this wall-bounded flow, the scale-adaptive simulation is considered. Numerical results are validated against experimental data, and the influence of the physical time-step size on the solution is regarded. To evaluate the influence of the underlying numerical grid, three meshing strategies are investigated. Validation of the transient flowfield allows the analysis of transport and mixing phenomena that are associated with a jet in cross flow at the small jet to cross-flow velocity ratio considered in this work. To gain deeper insight into the inherent dynamics of the flow, a proper orthogonal decomposition is carried out on a subdomain of the flow. It is shown that the second mode reveals the wake meandering as an important thermal mixing phenomenon.",51,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052059,"The longitudinal and transverse vibrations of an axially moving beam are analyzed when the beam has deploying or retracting motion. Comparing the previous studies in which only the transverse displacement is considered, the present study simultaneously considers the longitudinal and transverse displacements when deriving the equations of motion. To include a nonlinear effect, the nonlinear von Kármán strain theory is adopted. The derived equation of longitudinal motion is linear and uncoupled with the transverse motion, whereas the equation of transverse motion is nonlinear and coupled with the longitudinal motion. After computing numerical solutions from the equations, the longitudinal and transverse vibrations are analyzed with regard to the moving speed and acceleration of the beam. In addition, the present nonlinear analysis of a moving beam is compared with a previous linear analysis for the variations of the moving acceleration, moving speed, and Young’s modulus. The linear and nonlinear vibration analyses result in considerably different dynamic responses when the moving acceleration is large or when Young’s modulus is small.",51,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052106,"This paper presents the simulation of a wing/body configuration with a deflected spoiler using the Zonal Detached Eddy Simulation approach in an emergency dive scenario at the Reynolds number based on the wing chord . The objective is to assess the reliability of this numerical method in the framework of the creation of aerodynamic data models in off-design conditions. The mesh is built using the Chimera technique (or overset grids) to gather multiblock, structured, near-wall grids and Cartesian off-body grids. The results are compared to wind tunnel data and show the dramatic increase of accuracy provided by the zonal detached eddy simulation approach in the spoiler area compared to a standard steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation using the Spalart–Allmaras model. Furthermore, the zonal detached eddy simulation gives insights on the unsteady properties of the turbulent structures downstream of the spoiler, which is of major importance in the aerodynamic design process of an aircraft related to tail buffet.",51,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052126,"An efficient mesh-deformation algorithm has been developed within an unstructured-grid computational-fluid-dynamics solver framework based on a radial-basis-function volume-interpolation method. The data-transfer problem between fluid and structural solvers is simplified here using a beam structural representation, with surface mesh deformation given directly via translational and rotational deformations. The volume mesh deformation is then performed using a radial-basis-function method, which requires no mesh-connectivity information and allows straightforward implementation in an unstructured computational-fluid-dynamics solver in a parallel fashion. However, the pure method is impractical for large meshes, and a novel “greedy” data-reduction algorithm is presented here to select an optimum reduced set of surface mesh points, which makes the mesh-deformation method extremely efficient. Several two- and three-dimensional test cases are presented to validate the algorithm performance, including a realistic aircraft Bell M427 main rotor. It is shown that the approach can handle effectively very large mesh deformations of complex geometries using unstructured viscous meshes while maintaining good mesh quality and geometric accuracy, and generally requires less than 25% of the computational-fluid-dynamics flow-solver cost.",51,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052190,"An acoustic analogy approach is used to predict the turbulent mixing noise emitted by cold, subsonic, rectangular jets of aspect ratios 2, 4, and 8. Mean flow interaction effects are accounted for in terms of a Green’s function under the locally parallel mean flow approximation. The problem for the Green’s function is reduced to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations by modeling the mean flow as having level surfaces in crossflow planes coinciding with one coordinate in a cylindrical elliptical coordinate system and using a conformal mapping method. The Green’s function is combined with a previously developed hybrid source model to complete the prediction method. Source model coefficients are chosen based on the results of low-speed flow surveys in the nozzles considered. Results are compared with acoustic data, and it is found that the method is generally capable of predicting the measured azimuthal directivity characteristics of the sound field.",51,3
