0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053090,"The utility of constant blowing as an aerodynamic load control concept for wind turbine blades was explored experimentally. A NACA 0018 airfoil model equipped with control slots near the leading edge and at mid-chord was investigated initially under quasi-static conditions at Reynolds numbers ranging from to . Blowing from the leading-edge slot showed a significant potential for load control applications. Leading-edge stall was either promoted or inhibited depending on the momentum coefficient, and a corresponding reduction or increase in lift on the order of was obtained. Control from the mid-chord slot counteracted trailing-edge stall but was ineffective at preventing leading-edge separation. The impact of blowing from the leading-edge slot on dynamic stall was explored by means of unsteady surface pressure measurements and simultaneous particle image velocimetry above the suction surface. At a sufficiently high momentum coefficient, the formation and shedding of the dynamic stall vortex were fully suppressed. This led to a significant reduction in lift hysteresis and form drag while simultaneously mitigating moment coefficient excursions.",53,2

The data reveal the turbulent shear layer over the cavity and the recirculation region within it. The mean position of the recirculation region was found to be a function of the length-to-width ratio of the cavity, as was the turbulence intensity within both the shear layer and the recirculation region. Compressibility effects were observed in which turbulence levels dropped, and the shear layer thickness decreased as the Mach number was raised from 1.5 to 2.0 and 2.5. Supplemental measurements in the crossplane and the planform view suggest that zones of high turbulence were affixed to each sidewall centered on the cavity lip, with a strip of turbulence stretched out across the cavity shear layer for which the intensity was a function of the length-to-width ratio. These sidewall features are attributed to spillage, which is greatly reduced for the narrowest cavity. Such effects cannot be found in experiments lacking finite spanwise extent.",53,2

In this study, the transient evolution of shock interactions and separated flow is examined in nitrogen and air freestream conditions with stagnation enthalpies ranging from 2 to and Mach numbers from 4 to 7. The time-dependent flowfield and associated time scales required to reach mean values for both viscous and inviscid processes are investigated using fast-response thermocouples and high-speed schlieren and chemiluminescence imaging. In all cases, the oblique/bow-shock triple point is observed to propagate upstream to a mean location as the bow-shock standoff distance increases with time. For all freestream conditions, the triple point reaches a mean position in less time for the conical than the wedge flow. Distinct differences between nitrogen and air both in the evolution and mean flow features are observed in the highest-enthalpy test case. The triple-point establishment time is greater in nitrogen than air, corresponding to an increased bow-shock standoff distance, whereas the viscous establishment times in the region of peak heating are comparable. Although the observed dependence on freestream composition and enthalpy can be used to quantify the effect of thermochemistry, we note the time scales for viscous and inviscid processes are of the same order of magnitude for all conditions studied. Normalized establishment times of 2–8 are measured, in reasonable agreement with existing experimental data from surface gauges (6–11).",53,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053127,"A new test case for challenging current transition prediction methods for three-dimensional boundary layers is designed with special focus on the effect of spanwise varying mean flow. The wind-tunnel model of this test case has a sickle-shaped planform. It is equipped with pressure taps and a special skin layup to increase the contrast of infrared transition measurements. The wing is designed to generate three-dimensional boundary layers with increasing crossflow toward the wingtip. The sickle-shaped planform with distinct kinks creates spanwise gradients, and the assumptions of linear local stability theory are therefore challenged. It is found that, at locations of high spanwise gradients, the transition location moves upstream, due to strong amplification of stationary crossflow vortices. Hot-film measurements are used to identify and characterize traveling modes, and to quantify disturbance amplifications. The wing exhibits areas of rapidly growing Tollmien–Schlichting modes, which behave in good agreement with linear stability theory, whereas crossflow-dominated regions display both stationary and traveling crossflow modes.",53,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053130,"A generalized calibration process is presented for multihole, pressure-based velocity probes that is independent of the number of holes and probe geometry, allowing the use of probes with large numbers of holes. The calibration algorithm is demonstrated at low speeds with a conventional seven-hole pressure probe and a novel 19-hole pressure probe. Because the calibration algorithm is independent of probe configuration, it is very tolerant of data corruption and imperfections in the probe-tip geometry. The advantages of using probes with large numbers of holes is demonstrated in a conventional wing wake survey. The 19-hole probe offers a higher angular sensitivity than a conventional seven-hole probe and can accurately measure velocity components even when an analytical calibration scheme is used. The probe can also provide local estimates of the diagonal components of the crossflow velocity gradient tensor in highly vortical flows.",53,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053146,"Two of the most important requirements when using gradient-based optimization for fluid–structure interaction problems are efficiency and accuracy in calculating the sensitivities. As a result, analytical continuum sensitivity formulations are finding their place due to their lower cost and accuracy. However, the necessary computation of mesh sensitivities in shape optimization is becoming a bottleneck, especially when handling complex geometries. In this research, an algorithm based on continuum sensitivity analysis for structural shape design variables is developed. In the proposed method, regularized Heaviside functions are used to modify the properties of mesh cells. Therefore, mesh dependency is removed from the sensitivity equations. This method does not require moving or modifying the mesh to handle the shape changes. This method is applied to two different validation cases where continuum sensitivity equations are formulated and solved. Validation cases are selected as a structural and thermal problem to show the applicability of this method for different physics. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for design-optimization framework.",53,2

Because of the extremely harsh environment in which these materials operate, they are chemically eroded during motor firing, with a resulting performance reduction. The objective of the present work is to study the thermochemical erosion of graphite nozzles under a wide range of pressure conditions for both metallized and nonmetallized propellants. Numerical simulations are performed to reproduce recent literature experimental tests for nominal chamber pressures up to 250 bar. The adopted approach relies on a validated full Navier–Stokes flow solver coupled with a thermochemical ablation model that takes into account finite-rate heterogeneous chemical reactions at the nozzle surface, rate of diffusion of the species through the boundary layer, ablation species injection in the boundary layer, heat conduction inside the nozzle material, and variable multispecies thermophysical properties. Results show that numerical simulations are able to correctly evaluate the erosion rate, provided that modeling aspects such as entrance length and combustion efficiency are suitably accounted for.",53,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053159,"Simulation of wall-bounded turbulent flows poses significant challenges and requires tightly controlled mesh spacing and structure near the walls. Semistructured or hybrid meshes are often used for turbulent boundary layer flows. These meshes not only account for complex geometry but also maintain highly anisotropic, graded, and layered elements near the walls. However, for engineering flow problems, the mesh spacing required to achieve a given level of accuracy cannot be determined a priori and, therefore, an adaptive approach becomes essential. For wall-bounded turbulent flows, such an approach must incorporate the structure of the turbulent boundary layer and associated flow physics to guide the adaptive process. This paper introduces a new approach for boundary layer adaptivity, wherein flow physics indicators are used in combination with interpolation-based or numerical error indicators. The effectiveness of the current technique is demonstrated by applying them to two aerodynamic problems involving transonic turbulent flows.",53,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053101,"This paper presents a hybrid approach to model guided wave propagation in composite laminates. The global matrix approach is used to determine the displacement field surrounding a piezoelectric actuator. The displacement field is then enforced in a specified region of a numerical model that employs the local interaction simulation approach. This hybrid approach improves upon previous local interaction simulation approach methods that prescribe in-plane displacements within the actuator profile to model actuation. Additionally, it circumvents the problem of modeling nonrectangular actuators in the Cartesian discretization in the local interaction simulation approach. Results show that the hybrid model outperforms previous local interaction simulation approach models when considering actuation from circular, square, and composite long-range variable-direction emitting radar actuators. The hybrid model produces wave propagation time histories that closely match the baseline global matrix method and successfully capture directional effects resulting from the anisotropic nature of composite plates. The dependence of the results on in-plane discretization size is examined for aluminum, cross-ply, unidirectional, and quasi-isotropic plates. The results for the aluminum and unidirectional plates show considerable dependence on the in-plane cell dimensions, but that dependence is less pronounced for the cross-ply and quasi-isotropic cases.",53,2

The goal is to harvest flow energy available in high-wind areas toward enabling self-powered systems, such as sensor networks employed in structural health and usage monitoring of aircraft and rotorcraft. Other than bluff-body-based energy harvester configurations using vortex-induced vibrations, the use of an aeroelastic typical section with a proper transduction mechanism is a popular and convenient approach to create instabilities and persistent oscillations for flow energy harvesting. In this work, a hybrid three-degree-of-freedom airfoil-based aeroelastic energy harvester that simultaneously uses piezoelectric transduction and electromagnetic induction is analyzed based on fully coupled electroaeroelastic modeling. This particular configuration exploits a control surface for enhanced design flexibility as compared to its well-explored two-degree-of-freedom counterparts. The two transduction mechanisms are added to the plunge degree of freedom in the presence of two separate electrical loads, and dimensionless electroaeroelastic equations are obtained. The effects of aeroelastic parameters and load resistance values on the overall electroaeroelastic behavior (total power generation and linear flutter speed) are discussed in detail.",53,2

This paper also presents a rational function fitting method that could be used to transform transcendental equations of a feed-line transfer function into a homogeneous second-order matrix form. It is shown that this form of feed-line transfer function can be easily coupled together with governing equations of a liquid rocket structural system, which could be further solved for system stability using mature eigenvalue solvers. By comparison with the telemetry data and traditional methods, this pogo stability method proves to be highly accurate and efficient.",53,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053168,"This paper is a theoretical modeling study of the nonlinear transport of momentum and energy in a hypersonic rarefied flow past a sharp leading-edge flat plate at zero angle of attack. A characteristic parameter is introduced to describe the non-Newtonian shear and non-Fourier heat transfer features in the near-continuum flow regime via approximate analyses on the corresponding terms from the Burnett equation. Modified formulas based on are proposed to quantitatively predict the skin friction and heat flux along the plate, and the Reynolds analogy is proved to still be valid in the near-continuum flow regime. The physical meaning of and the flow mechanism are discussed. The direct simulation Monte Carlo method is also employed to validate the analytical results and to show the existence of a general analogy between the skin friction and heat flux in the whole flow regime from the continuum through the transition to the free molecular flow limit.",53,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053184,"In this study, a feedback mechanism for supersonic deep-cavity flows is modeled. The model is developed on the basis of previous flow visualization results. In this model, two pressure waves play an important role in the feedback mechanism; one wave is generated at the trailing edge of the cavity owing to the motion of the shear layer, and the other wave is generated as a result of the third reflection of the former wave at the cavity bottom. The constants in the model are determined using the flow visualization results. The frequencies calculated in the model agree well with the dominant frequencies observed in experiments; in particular, the feedback mechanism responsible for deep-cavity-induced pressure oscillation is successfully clarified.",53,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053193,"Quantitative comparison of biodynamic responses, simulated using the Patil or Liu lumped parameter models, were carried out with respect to experimental anthropomorphic test dummy response data obtained from the Sikorsky advanced composite airframe program helicopter crash test. The biodynamic responses obtained from these models were characterized by large offsets from the experimental peak magnitudes, large perturbations in biodynamic displacements, and delayed response. The inability to accurately predict biodynamic response using either model led to development of a new four-degree-of-freedom nonlinear biodynamic model corresponding to a Hybrid II 50th-percentile male occupant, the parameters of which were identified by minimizing the least-square error between the simulated and advanced composite airframe program experimental responses. The new model accurately predicts peak magnitude, overall shape, and duration of the biodynamic transient response, with minimal phase shift. The biodynamic model was further validated using data from the crashworthy composite fuselage drop experiment conducted by Fasanella and Jackson ( “ Impact Testing and Simulation of a Crashworthy Composite Fuselage Section with Energy-Absorbing Seats and Dummies ,” Journal of the American Helicopter Society , Vol.  49 , No.  2 , 2004 , pp.  140 – 148 ). The biodynamic model overpredicted the peak lumbar loads by 1.06% when compared to the pilot’s anthropomorphic test dummy response from the Sikorsky advanced composite airframe program experiment, and it predicted lumbar loads within when compared to crashworthy composite fuselage experiments.",53,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053195,"This paper presents the development of a mixed-variable optimization framework for the aeroelastic analysis and design of active twist rotors. Proper tailoring of the blade properties can lead to the maximization of the active twist and the control authority for vibration reduction under operating conditions. Thus, using mathematical optimization, the cross-sectional layout is designed using continuous and discrete design variables for an active composite rotor blade to maximize the dynamic active twist while satisfying a series of constraints on blade cross-section parameters, stiffness, and strength. The optimization framework developed includes the Intelligent Cross-Section Generator as the cross-section and mesh generator, University of Michigan/Variational Asymptotic Beam Sectional analysis code for active cross-sectional analysis, and Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis Software for aeroelastic analysis of the active twist rotor blade. The optimization problem is solved using a surrogate-based approach in combination with the Efficient Global Optimization algorithm. In this paper, the results with mixed design variables are obtained with three different techniques and are compared with the results obtained using continuous design variables.",53,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053201,"The paper presents a computational study of the transonic shock-buffet flow instability phenomenon on three-dimensional wings. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations were conducted on three wing configurations, all based on the RA16SC1 airfoil, at shock-buffet flow conditions. Numerical validation is presented for the OAT15A and RA16SC1 swept wings based on wind-tunnel experiments. The simulated configurations include infinite-straight, infinite-swept, and finite-swept three-dimensional wing models of several sweep angles and span lengths. Based on the results, the effects of three-dimensional flow, wing sweep, and span length on the shock-buffet characteristics are identified. For small wing-sweep angles, the fundamental shock-buffet instability mechanism remains similar to the two-dimensional mechanism, which is characterized mainly by chordwise shock oscillations. For moderate sweep angles, a phenomenon of lateral pressure disturbance propagation is observed. This phenomenon is essentially different from the two-dimensional shock-buffet mechanism yet results in oscillations of the sectional aerodynamic coefficients. The paper presents and discusses both phenomena, and it suggests a connection between them. For high-wing-sweep angles, the wing is stalled and shock buffet is eliminated. For low-aspect-ratio wings, the flow is dominated by tip vortices, and shock buffet is eliminated. For high-aspect-ratio wings, wingtip effects are minor and limited to the tip region. For intermediate-aspect-ratio cases, tip vortices and shock-buffet interaction results in irregular shock oscillations.",53,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053142,"The stall-delaying properties of the humpback whale flipper have been observed and quantified in recent years, through both experimental and numerical studies. In the present work, numerical simulations of an infinite-span wing with an idealized representation of this geometry are reported at a Reynolds number of . Using large-eddy simulation, an adequate spatial resolution is first established before also examining the spanwise extent of the domain. These results are then analyzed to provide an explanation of the conditions that drive the lift observed beyond the conventional stall angle. The undulating leading-edge geometry gives rise to a spanwise pressure gradient that drives a secondary flow toward the regions of minimum chord. In turn, this leads to the entrainment of higher-momentum fluid into the region behind the maximum chord, which energizes the boundary layer and delays stall. Aside from demonstrating a significant poststall lift, the undulations also have the added benefit of substantially reducing lift fluctuations.",53,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053194,"This paper presents a complete set of analytical expressions for the stiffness constants of a generalized Euler–Bernoulli beam theory for homogeneous, anisotropic, prismatic beams with arbitrary cross-sectional shapes. These expressions are extracted from exact solutions of the linear equations of three-dimensional elasticity for the cases of loading by axial forces, torques, and bending moments about two orthogonal directions. Closed-form expressions are derived for the extensional stiffness and the extension-related coupling terms. Expressions for the remaining stiffness constants are derived in terms of the torsional stiffness: the expression of which is in terms of a function that needs to be obtained. The resulting expressions reveal both similarities and differences from its isotropic and orthotropic counterparts. For elliptical, anisotropic cross sections and rectangular, orthotropic cross sections, all stiffness constants are known in closed form. These closed-form expressions constitute a standard with which the ability of two-dimensional beam cross-sectional analyses to model material anisotropy may be assessed. The calculated stiffness constants, from one such cross-sectional analysis, are successfully validated in this manner.",53,2

The model relies on the introduction of a second separated wake from the suction side to correctly account for the aerodynamic effects of stall conditions and is provided with correction models whose aim is to consider the dynamic evolution of the shed vortices and of the separation point. The model receives as input experimental data to estimate the nonoscillating steady-state separation point for different angles of attack. A validation procedure confirmed the model capabilities to provide reliable numerical estimations of the lift coefficient for a pitching airfoil compared to experimental tests and computational-fluid-dynamics approaches based on the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations complemented with the shear-stress transport turbulence model. In particular, the dynamic stall phenomenon is correctly simulated, providing lift coefficients in a hysteresis cycle. In addition, the computational effort is strongly reduced compared to the other computational tools and therefore enables the model to be used in routines with several simulation calls (e.g., optimization).",53,2

The surface accuracy, which is crucially important to the performance of the reflector, is maintained by support ribs stretched by the tension system. To obtain sufficient surface accuracy, a reverse design algorithm is proposed to design the initial lower-edge shape of the support rib, which is verified by the current experiment. Also, the morphing characteristics of the support rib under different tensions are tested using the Vic-3D whole strain testing system. From the results of the experiments and simulations, some effective control strategies are presented to resist the local buckles of rib. The main approach is to introduce some transverse constraints that are perpendicular to the rib at the local buckling positions.

20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053547,"Characterizing the unstart margin is very important for the hypersonic inlet to achieve maximum performance within safety range. A novel approach for characterizing the unstart margin when combustor–isolator interactions are taken into account is presented. First, experiments with four Mach numbers were conducted in a direct-connect supersonic isolator–combustor. The start-to-unstart process and the unstart-to-restart process were analyzed, and it is found that they should be discussed separately due to the hysteresis and different conditions of the isolator. A good way of indicating the unstart margin should be that the unstart margin maintains a linear relationship with the equivalence ratio. For the shock-train leading edge, it is concluded that, when combustion is considered, its behavior is rather complicated, which makes it inappropriate for characterizing the unstart margin. Then, the backpressure method is discussed, and its nonlinearity with equivalence ratio makes it not an ideal way to indicate the unstart margin. A new approach based on pressure distribution area integral is proposed to characterize unstart margin. Results show that unstart margin indicated by the pressure distribution area integral has a better linear relationship with equivalence ratio. However, the pressure distribution area integral method will need many sensors. To use as few sensors as possible, the genetic algorithm is introduced for sensor selection and reduction. The simulation and test at multi-operating conditions show its validity.",53,2
