The proposed model takes into account the high-order diffracted modes, and therefore incorporates mutual coupling among neighboring cavities. The model predicts a reflection frequency consistent with the numerical results and reproduces a coupling mode induced by interactions between waves scattered from adjacent cavities. With this model, the cavity geometry parameters are optimized to achieve the minimum reflection coefficient. The result shows that the Mack second mode is strongly suppressed and that the maximum fluctuating pressure decreases by about 88% upon using the optimized porous coating in a Mach 6 flat-plate flow.",56,8

Schlieren is used in combination with a high-speed camera to investigate the internal dynamics of sweeping jet actuators. These devices are of particular interest due to their great success in active flow control applications for aerodynamic purposes. Their working principle based on schlieren images is discussed in detail based on a first model. An extended theory based on nondimensional frequency and jet velocity is introduced. A second model consisting of two adjacent sweeping jet actuators is investigated on their interaction characteristics by tracking their motion in the acquired schlieren images and the subsequent analysis of the relative deflection of the jets using fast Fourier transform, phase information, and the Hilbert transform. This is performed for multiple separation distances and two pressure ratios, leading to an underexpanded exit jet and a transonic jet. Last, the probability distribution of the deflection angles for both cases is discussed.",56,8

This geometry has been the focus of several recent publications that investigated methods to improve the efficiency of SWJ actuators. In the current study, the interaction of the AFC excitation with the separated flowfields of several flap deflection angles was examined. Previous studies with this model have been limited to a maximum flap deflection angle of 40 deg. The flap deflection range was extended to 60 deg because systems studies have indicated that a high-lift system with simple-hinged flaps may require larger flap deflections than the Fowler flaps found on most high-lift systems. The results obtained at flap deflection angles of 20, 40, and 60 deg are presented and compared. Force and moment data, particle image velocimetry (PIV) data, and steady and unsteady surface pressure data are used to describe the flowfield with and without AFC. With a flap deflection of 60 deg, increasing the SWJ actuator momentum at the flap shoulder increased lift due to an increase in circulation but did not completely eliminate the recirculation region above the flap surface. AFC using the discrete steady jet actuators of this study increased lift as well but required more mass flow than the SWJ actuators and had a detrimental effect on lift at the highest mass flow level tested. PIV results showed that the angle between the excitation and the flap surface was not optimal for attaching the separated shear layer.",56,8
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056720,"Dynamic stall represents a challenge in a number of engineering applications including rotorcraft, maneuvering aircraft, gust encounters, and wind turbines. Delay of the onset of dynamic stall and mitigation of its undesirable transient loading effects have been sought in the past five decades employing a number of passive and active flow control techniques. Development of improved flow control approaches requires the detailed characterization of the underlying boundary-layer processes preceding the onset of abrupt unsteady separation. Such information is difficult to acquire experimentally, given the spatial and temporal resolution requirements and the difficulties encountered with near-wall measurements over a moving wing. In this regard, modern computational approaches offer a complementary research tool for advancing active flow control. In the present paper, a flow control strategy for the delay of dynamic stall on a pitching airfoil is developed and demonstrated, employing high-fidelity wall-resolved large-eddy simulations and stability analysis. The point of departure is a detailed analysis of the uncontrolled dynamic stall case revealing the critical role played by the laminar separation bubble (LSB). This observation motivated the exploration of very high-frequency [] actuation targeting the convective instabilities present in the LSB. Provided that the imposed forcing frequency or its harmonics are high enough for amplification within the LSB, very small forcing amplitude is required for control effectiveness. This approach, guided by linear stability theory and detailed flowfield information, is successfully demonstrated for the delay of dynamic stall over a pitching NACA 0012 wing section.",56,8
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056782,The stability and steering of nonspinning airborne bodies of revolution have traditionally relied on stationary or moving fins that affect controlled interactions with the oncoming flow to modify the inherent aerodynamic loads. An alternative approach for manipulation of these loads in the absence of external control surfaces can be realized by exploiting the reciprocal coupling between a moving bluff body and its near wake by either breaking or restoring the natural azimuthal near-wake symmetry using segmented fluidic actuation. The present paper reviews fluidic actuation of the near-wake dynamics by using an azimuthally segmented four-quadrant array of aft-facing synthetic jet modules around the tail end of an axisymmetric bluff-body model. Each actuator controls a segment of the aft separated vorticity layer using a hybrid configuration with a passive Coanda surface. The actuation allows for controlled suppression or enhancement of near-wake asymmetries and consequently of the associated aerodynamic forces and moments on a stationary model and in rigid-body motion. It is shown that the effects of actuation on the near-wake and aerodynamic loads of the static body are comparable to the effects of its combined pitch and yaw motions in the absence of actuation. The actuation provides significant suppression and augmentation of the motion-induced aerodynamic loads with concomitant controlled deflection or decoupling between the motions of the body and its near wake. It is anticipated that controlled manipulation of these fundamental coupling mechanisms can lead to active control of the motion and stability of flight platforms.,56,8

As a structurally strong variance for durable use in low-speed airfoil and turbine applications, this study looks experimentally into the low-profile triangular convergent riblet element (consisting of two short convergent vanes of triangular cross sections with 30 deg half-intervane angles) in incompressible laminar flow. The flow organization and instability within the wake of isolated vortex generators are thus investigated using hot-wire measurements over a length of downstream of the element, where is the local boundary-layer thickness. A preliminary analysis serves first to characterize the effect of the isolated element height across height adjustments for rectangular cross-section elements. A selection of three triangular element heights is subsequently investigated in detail, undergoing the following: 1) with , longitudinal vortices are found to remain quasi steady and with eventual disturbance attenuation; 2) with , the wake starts exhibiting strong fluctuations as it approaches critical conditions; and 3) with , transition to turbulence takes place close behind the element. The switch from a varicose to a sinuous wake instability for low-profile (near-critical) configurations places the transition onset within the region of strong lateral shear.",56,8
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056272,"Regarding space missions, electric propulsion efficiency is a hot topic due to the development of microsatellites. However, ablative pulsed plasma thrusters, which were the first electric propulsion devices, suffer from low efficiency (less than 10%). In this study, a double-discharge ablative pulsed plasma thruster that allocates the total energy to two capacitors and discharges at different locations was designed to improve the efficiency of these thrusters. The performance of the double-discharge ablative pulsed plasma thruster was calculated based on experimental results under four different working conditions. The results showed that the double-discharge ablative pulsed plasma thruster performance was significantly improved relative to that of a regular ablative pulsed plasma thruster, in which the total energy is stored in a single capacitor. When the total energy remains constant (2.25 J), as the energy allocated to the secondary capacitor increases, the thrust efficiency and specific impulse increased significantly, respectively. Finally, theoretical analysis combined with the experimental results revealed the successful separation of the ablation–ionization and acceleration processes for the double-discharge ablative pulsed plasma thruster, contributing to the improvement of its performance. This research provides a reference for the design of high-performance ablative pulsed plasma thrusters.",56,8

The reconfigurable hardware is designed such that it is possible to reprogram its architecture after manufacturing. This provides the capability to design and implement various architectures for several applications. Two reconfigurable chips are used in the present study, one of which consists of a programmable logic unit and a typical microprocessor. This hybrid architecture makes the high performance of the reconfigurable hardware in custom computing and the efficiency of the microprocessor in data flow control accessible. An automated design procedure is used for the design of the reconfigurable hardware. Further, a finite difference representation of a phenomenological model of a plasma actuator is derived and implemented on the field-programmable gate array hardware. The results are validated against other numerical data, and the computational time is compared to different conventional processors. Using the reconfigurable hardware results in up to 96% computational time reduction compared to a recent Core i7 processor.",56,8

Simulations are based on experiments in which hydrogen is injected into a hypersonic air-crossflow, compressed by a ramp from a freestream Mach number of 8 to below hydrogen autoignition conditions. Ignition of the jet is attempted using a laser pulse, modeled in the simulations as a small region of high temperature and pressure corresponding to the energy input measured in the experiments. To capture the highly unsteady nature of the fuel-air interface and its coupling with the dynamics of the expanding laser spark, wall-modeled large-eddy Simulations are used to resolve the majority of turbulent motion. Thermal nonequilibrium and detailed finite-rate chemistry models are included in the calculations. The simulations indicate that the cloud of hydroxyl radicals detected in the experiments is created on the jet’s forward surface, as the expanding plasma kernel drives a blast wave into the bowshock surrounding the jet. This event raises the temperature and pressure in the upstream mixing layer, causing spontaneous ignition of the mixture. Within tens of microseconds the laser-induced combustion detaches from the jet and combustion ceases due to unfavorable conditions for flame anchoring in this area. Downstream of the jet, the simulations suggest that the plasma kernel remains can initiate radical formation in the wake region, but no stable flame forms due to nominally low pressures in the experimental condition studied.",56,8

This paper extends the functionality of coKriging. First, a practical implementation to high-dimensional output functions is developed by introducing POD-coKriging. Second, coKriging is reformulated to allow different sizes of input/output variables between low- and high-fidelity tools. The extended POD-coKriging method is validated against an analytical problem, and its performance for high-dimensional output functions is demonstrated with the prediction of surface pressure distribution on a two-dimensional deflected panel in hypersonic flow. Finally, properties of the extended POD-coKriging were used to estimate the total cost reduction of sample generation, and it is shown that an order-of-magnitude cost reduction is achievable for practical cases.",56,8
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056789,"A computational model is developed using a delayed detached-eddy simulation to examine the various aspects of shock-wave/vortex interactions, in which the specific case of naturally formed bow shock wave generated during a sonic injection into a supersonic crossflow is considered. The model is validated by comparing with experimental results obtained previously and is deployed to investigate the effects of shock/vortex interaction on mixing characteristics of supersonic flows. A vortex generator, in the form of a semispan wing section, is placed at an angle of attack upstream of an injection location. The resultant vortex interacts with the bow shock, and for a sufficiently strong interaction, there is breakdown of the supersonic vortex. The vortex bursting observed during the computational study is in a very good agreement with a previous physical model. The computational results demonstrate that the shock/vortex interaction can be an effective method of mixing enhancement because it results in redistribution and increase of vorticity in the flowfield, which enhances the entrainment and eventual mixing of injectant and supersonic crossflow.",56,8
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056404,"To reduce the numerical dissipation in turbulence modeling while maintaining the numerical stability around flow discontinuities in supersonic flowfield, a low-dissipative compressible solver is developed for large-eddy simulation within the OpenFOAM framework. To achieve the aforementioned goals, the low-dissipative solver adopts the hybrid scheme approach through combining the dissipative Kurganov–Tadmor scheme with the nondissipative central scheme via a shock sensor. In the construction of the central scheme, a robust skew-symmetric form of the convective term is adopted to preserve the local kinetic energy without adding an explicit dissipative term. Another feature of the low-dissipative solver is the implementation of an optimal explicit strong stability-preserving linear third-order total variation diminishing Runge–Kutta method for the temporal discretization. Numerical tests for a series of canonical flow problems are carried out to validate the solver’s good performance in the flowfield either with strong discontinuities or with continuous spectrum characteristics. Large-eddy simulation of a scramjet combustor with supersonic airstream passing over the flame holder is conducted to validate the low-dissipative solver’s reliability in a realistic flow with the complex interaction of shock discontinuities and turbulence.",56,8
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056596,"Large-eddy simulations were used to investigate turbulent temperature fluctuations and turbulent heat flux in hot jets. A high-resolution finite difference Navier–Stokes solver was used to compute the flow from a 2 in. round nozzle. Three different flow conditions of varying jet Mach numbers and temperature ratios were examined. The large-eddy simulation results showed that the temperature field behaved similarly to the velocity field but with a more rapidly spreading mixing layer. Predictions of the mean and fluctuating velocities were compared to particle image velocimetry data. Predictions of the mean and fluctuating temperatures were compared to data obtained using Rayleigh scattering and Raman spectroscopy. Very good agreement with experimental data was demonstrated for the mean and fluctuating velocities. The large-eddy simulation correctly predicted the behavior of the turbulent temperature field but overpredicted the levels of the fluctuations. The turbulent heat flux was examined and compared to the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes results. The large-eddy simulation and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations produced very similar results for the radial heat flux. However, the axial heat flux obtained from the large-eddy simulation differed significantly from the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes result in both structure and magnitude, indicating that the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model was inadequate. Finally, the large-eddy simulation data were used to compute the turbulent Prandtl number and verify that a constant value of 0.7, which is typically used in the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models, was a reasonable assumption.",56,8

The stability of oblique detonation waves is investigated with two-dimensional simulations based on the open-source program AMROC (from “Adaptive Mesh Refinement in Object-Oriented C++”). The results show that the oblique detonation waves with a smooth transition are more resistant to upstream disturbances, requiring less time than the abrupt ones to recover their stable state. Subsequently, a theoretical analysis based on the ideal thermodynamic cycle is carried out to investigate the thermodynamic efficiency of the oblique detonation cycles under different inflow conditions. The efficiency loss is introduced to measure the difference in thermodynamic efficiency between the oblique detonation waves and Chapman–Jouguet detonations. In addition, the influence of initial compression, inflow velocity, equivalence ratio, and wedge angle on the efficiency loss are studied. Finally, the optimum working condition is analyzed based on the stability of oblique detonation waves and the thermodynamic efficiency of oblique detonation wave cycles, indicating that the oblique detonation waves in an oblique detonation wave engine should be maintained in the shift area between the abrupt and the smooth transition.",56,8

Three turbulence models were considered: Spalart–Allmaras, 2006 Wilcox , and Menter shear-stress transport. Several structured and unstructured grid topologies were employed in the analysis. The Fun3D code of NASA Langley Research Center and the BCFD code of the Boeing Company were used as the flow solvers. The uncertainty analysis employed stochastic expansions based on nonintrusive polynomial chaos for efficient uncertainty propagation. Sobol indices were used to rank the relative contributions of each coefficient to the total uncertainty in the output quantities of interest. The solutions obtained with all grids and computational-fluid-dynamics codes identified a common set of coefficients for each turbulence model that influence the output uncertainty significantly for transonic wall-bounded flows.",56,8

It is shown that using the original version of the One-shot approach for which the reduced velocity is prescribed as an input, only the stable LCO branch can be captured. A modification to the technique is proposed to extend its capability to capture the unstable LCO branch below the linear flutter point. In this new approach, the amplitude of pitching is prescribed instead of the reduced velocity. This necessitates simultaneously updating the reduced frequency and the reduced velocity at each aeroelastic iteration. The update procedure is based on optimization of a simple figure-of-merit. The original and improved versions of the One-shot approach are implemented in a single solver with minor modifications to attain maximum flexibility in determining LCO conditions. Numerical results demonstrate a good agreement with those reported in the literature as well as those obtained using the HB/LCO method and a traditional time-accurate approach. Finally, the computational efficiency of the One-shot method is discussed.",56,8
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056784,"Momentum source methods are an efficient means of representing airfoils in Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Momentum source terms are added to the Navier–Stokes equations instead of resolving the solid boundary of the airfoil with a mesh. These source terms are calculated using an aerodynamics model. This approach is useful where the overall performance and mid- to far-field influence of a wing or rotor are desired and details of the flowfield near the blade are not the objective of the simulation. One example is simulation of rotorcraft operations where the objective may be to assess an operation’s feasibility in terms of control margins, rather than to inform rotor design decisions. Coupling an aerodynamics model to a CFD solver is straightforward in cases where the airflow relative to the blade is steady. Unsteady conditions require an unsteady aerodynamics model, complicating the coupling with the CFD solver. A coupling method is proposed whereby the incident velocity is extracted from the CFD solution and corrected using a theory-based approximation for the unsteady induced velocity. The steady-state momentum source method is demonstrated for two- and three-dimensional simulations, and the unsteady coupling method is validated against experiments on a pitching airfoil and verified for blade–vortex interactions. The unsteady coupling method enables meaningful incident velocities to be extracted from unsteady flowfields, as shown by agreement with experiments and simulations using analytical expressions for the incident velocity in place of the CFD solver.",56,8

18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057054,"An improved finite-element method for predicting sound propagation in nonuniform flows is proposed. Sound waves are described by the linearized potential theory solved in the frequency domain. Solutions are calculated using the -FEM method with high-order, hierarchic shape functions that results in a drastic improvement in computational efficiency. The memory and time requirements for solving large-scale problems are significantly reduced compared with standard finite-element methods. An additional feature presented in this paper is an adaptive scheme to select the optimal interpolation order in each element so as to achieve a prescribed accuracy. This greatly simplifies the preparation of the numerical model. When performing a series of calculations at different frequencies there is no need to adjust the mesh to maintain a sufficient resolution. Instead the adaptive -FEM method adjusts the interpolation order automatically to ensure an accurate solution is obtained. The performance of the method is demonstrated for three-dimensional test cases for noise radiation from a turbofan intake. Guidelines for preparing models using this adaptive, high-order approach are also discussed.",56,8

This technique has been demonstrated to increase resolutions of two-dimensional simulations up to four times in each dimension [Kitamura, K., and Hashimoto, A., “Simple a posteriori Slope Limiter (Post Limiter) for High Resolution and Efficient Flow Computations,” Journal of Computational Physics, Vol. 341, July 2017, pp. 313–340]. This paper extends the postlimiter to three dimensions with an emphasis on ”dirty” (meaning ill-shaped) cells, which arise in practical three-dimensional (3-D) unstructured grids over complex geometries. Gradient accuracy is known to significantly deteriorate on dirty cells, and a slope limiter needs to be applied. However, the original postlimiter does not recognize dirty cells and deactivates a slope limiter. To address this issue, a simple dirty-cell detection method is proposed and incorporated into the postlimiter. The 3-D version of postlimiter (referred to as “postlimiter 3”) is successfully incorporated into fast aerodynamic routine (FaSTAR), a 3-D unstructured grid flow solver is developed at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Postlimiter 3 can handle general 3-D unstructured grids.

20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055600,"The application of computational fluid dynamics to support open jet airfoil experiments is investigated. Aerodynamic installation effects are one of the main challenges encountered in open jet facilities, where the limited jet width and expanding free shear layers can strongly influence the performance of the airfoil being tested. Two promising areas that build on the insight provided by computational fluid dynamics are explored. The first involves assessing the interaction between the free shear layers and airfoil as it gets repositioned inside the working section. For that purpose, the virtual origin deflection is used as a metric of the interaction, which provides a quantitative measure of the free shear layer deflection by the airfoil. The second area of computational fluid dynamics potential involves applying airfoil inverse design to transform the airfoil geometry in order to reduce the error in pressure loading between the available open jet facility and a desired target. The application of the two proposed techniques has been demonstrated successfully by modifying a standard open jet airfoil experiment configuration. Both methods can contribute toward open jet experiments design or assist in the comparison and analysis of data obtained from different open jet facilities.",56,8

First, flowfield measurements were performed using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry at conditions where a stall cell was present. This enabled some of the properties associated with stall cell(s) and stall cell transition to be defined. For the parametric study, angles of attack from to 21.5 deg and Reynolds numbers from to were observed using oil-flow visualizations, demonstrating the transition from full span separation to fully formed single or dual stall cells. At and , full span separation with recirculation regions was present, whereas at midrange of Reynolds numbers tested, three-dimensional separation was observed with undulations across the span. At , a single stall cell formed when the Reynolds number exceeded a critical Reynolds number. At the highest angles of attack tested, a dual stall cell configuration was present at high Reynolds numbers. In addition, the evolution of a stall cell was observed to be reminiscent of the mechanism proposed by Weihs and Katz (“Cellular Patterns in Poststall Flow over Unswept Wings,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 21, No. 12, 1983, pp. 1757–1759).

The flow behavior was also examined computationally using OVERFLOW, a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver. Splitter plates with lengths ranging from 50 to 150% of the trailing-edge thickness were applied to the airfoil model. Drag reductions of at least 27% from the baseline were observed with the inclusion of a splitter plate with length 50% of the trailing-edge thickness, accompanied by a 5% loss in maximum lift. An increasing splitter plate length was shown to decrease the base drag, maximum lift, and stall angle.

As such, this paper presents a study of the construction of the aerofoil optimization problem and its effect on the performance over a range of operating conditions. Single-point and multipoint optimizations of aerofoils in transonic flow are considered, and an improved range-based optimization problem subject to a constraint on fixed nondimensional wing loading with a varying design point is formulated. This problem is more representative of the aircraft design problem, though similar in cost to single-point drag minimization. An analytical treatment using an approximation of wave drag, which demonstrates that the optimum Mach number for a fixed shape is supercritical if the required loading is above a critical threshold, is also presented. This paper presents optimizations that show that to define an effective objective function three-dimensional effects modelled via an induced drag term must be introduced. The general trend is to produce solutions with higher Mach numbers and lower lift coefficients, and shocked solutions perform better when considering the performance in a range over the operating space. Furthermore, the resulting aerofoil shapes are supercritical in nature, a particularly promising result.",56,8

To successfully simulate the clap and fling motion involving the wing intersection, the numerical solver has been specifically modified to use a newly improved interpolation template searching algorithm to prevent divergence. Reasonable agreement was found between the numerical and experimental results, with the first and second force peaks from the experimental results well captured by the simulations, which was not possible in the past. Moreover, a “V-shaped linked” vortex was observed, which was similar to the vortical structures found in other experiments and simulations. A wing drag analysis showed that the drag magnitude of the clap and fling configuration was about 2.5 times that of the single-wing configuration. Visualizations of the flowfields through pressure contours and vortical isosurfaces led to a better understanding of the underlying flapping-wing aerodynamics.

25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056961,"Three model motions were developed to replicate the aerodynamic response of a transverse gust. These motions included a pure plunging and two three-degree-of-freedom motions that approximated the angle-of-attack distribution produced by the gust. Using inviscid models and viscous flow simulations, the responses of the gust and model motions were compared as a function of the nondimensional reduced frequency. The inviscid model was found to overestimate the influence of the rotational added mass in the three-degree-of-freedom motions. In contrast, the viscous flow simulations showed that the two primary sources of discrepancy between the gust and model motions lie in the nonlinear angle-of-attack distribution caused by the gust and the wake development during the model motions. Flow simulations showed that all three motions experienced greater than 90% agreement in lift for gusts with reduced frequencies less than 0.5, indicating that, under this reduced frequency, 1) the effect of the gust convection is minimal, and 2) a pure-plunging motion may suffice for modeling gusts. However, at higher reduced frequencies, the pure-plunging motion experiences greater than 10% worse agreement than the three-degree-of-freedom motions. Overall, the motions provide a good approximation with greater than 90% accuracy in lift for gusts of reduced frequencies less than .",56,8

Propeller-induced flow effects in both tractor and pusher configurations on a rectangular wing using the Wortmann FX 63-137 airfoil (a common low-Reynolds-number high-lift airfoil) are presented in this paper. Significant performance benefits can be found for a wing in the tractor configuration. Experiments, including trip tests and upper-surface oil flow visualization, show and verify that the propeller slipstream induces early transition to turbulent flow in the regions within the slipstream and the premature formation of a separation bubble in the regions outside the slipstream. The result is a reduction of pressure drag and an increase in lift of the wing where lift-to-drag ratios are as high as 10–12 (a maximum of 70% increase in lift-to-drag ratio from a clean wing configuration) and are measured at both low and high angles of attack up to stall (0–16 deg). Similar performance benefits are not observed in pusher configuration results where only increased local flow velocity and varying inflow angle effects are apparent. Thus, contrary to the design rules for optimal performance of wings at high Reynolds numbers, at low Reynolds numbers, a propeller in the tractor configuration exhibits significant performance improvements, especially in cruise configurations (low angles of attack), as compared with a propeller in the pusher configuration or even a clean wing.",56,8
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056529,"This work discusses a novel approach, Bayesian-inspired multifidelity optimization, for solving complex optimization requiring computationally expensive simulations. Bayesian-inspired multifidelity optimization aims to minimize computational cost in achieving accurate high-fidelity results through the use of low-fidelity (computationally cheaper) models in combination with a surrogate correction model. A novel Bayesian hybrid bridge function was developed to serve as the low-fidelity correction technique. This Bayesian hybrid bridge function is a Bayesian weighted average of two standard bridge functions, additive and multiplicative. The correction technique is implemented in parallel with a modified trust region model management optimization scheme. It is shown that optimization on the corrected low-fidelity model converges to the same local optimum as optimization on the high-fidelity model in fewer high-fidelity model. This technique is developed to reach that optimum in fewer high-fidelity function evaluations than traditional optimization, ultimately reducing computational cost. This work also extends the low-fidelity correction optimization beyond the traditional bifidelity optimization to that of optimization with multiple-fidelity objective and constraint functions. The proposed solution technique allows for use of commercial optimizers and is demonstrated on three separate problems. The first demonstration is on a one-dimensional analytical test case in which the Bayesian correction is shown. Then, the ability to handle multiple fidelities in both the objective and constraint functions is presented and discussed using a two-dimensional analytical test case. An airfoil shape optimization problem is then used to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach in an engineering design scenario in which the various fidelities arise as a difference in computational physics. It is shown via these demonstrations that implementation of this Bayesian low-fidelity correction optimization approach results in convergence to a high-fidelity optimum at a reduced computational cost in comparison to traditional optimization techniques.",56,8
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056748,"Minimum-weight aircraft wing design, with an emphasis on avoiding aeroelastic instability, has been studied since the 1960s. The majority of works to date were posed as sizing problems; only a handful of researchers have employed a topology optimization approach. The aim of this study is to use the level set method for this purpose. The problem is formulated as one of plate thickness distribution, which takes on one of two prescribed values at every point on the wing planform. This is combined with constraints implemented on the eigenvalues of the flutter equation; such an approach is shown to be robust and versatile. Optimization results for rectangular plate wings at a range of sweep configurations studied previously are included to validate the present methods. Delta, high-aspect-ratio, and typical swept transport wing planforms are then optimized. All solutions demonstrate the ability to significantly reduce wing mass while maintaining flutter and divergence speed above a specified limit, which can be higher than that of the reference, maximum-thickness design. The proposed method can be used to provide insights into optimal aeroelastic wing structures and is particularly useful for developing unconventional aircraft structural configurations.",56,8
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055917,"One of the key functionalities required in a mission for removing a noncooperative spacecraft is the assessment of its kinematics and inertial properties. In a few cases, this information can be approximated by ground observations. However, a reassessment after the rendezvous phase is of critical importance for refining the capture strategies. This paper proposes a set of measurement methods to estimate the location of the center of mass, the angular rate, and the moments of inertia of a passive object. These methods require the chaser spacecraft to be capable of tracking a few known features of the target through passive vision sensors. They can be applied considering a chaser spacecraft flying close to the target for a time long enough to complete the measurement. Because of the harsh lighting conditions of the space environment, feature-based methods should tolerate temporary failure in detecting features. The principal works on this topic do not consider this important aspect, making it a distinctive element of the proposed methods. The proposed techniques do not depend solely on state observers. However, methods for recovering missing information, like compressive sampling techniques, are used for preprocessing input data to support the efficient usage of state observers. Simulation results showed accuracy properties that are comparable to those of experimentally tested methods already proposed in the literature.",56,8
