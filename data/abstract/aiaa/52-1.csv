4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052610,"An airfoil parameterization method is proposed, which combines the flexibility and accuracy of Kulfan’s class/shape function transformation method and the intuitiveness of Sobieczky’s parameterization method for airfoil sections. The proposed intuitive class/shape function transformation method has been evaluated by comparing it with the class/shape function transformation and parameterization method for airfoil sections regarding their accuracy in inversely fitting a wide range of airfoils. The results show that the intuitive class/shape function transformation method is able to successfully transform the class/shape function transformation method into a fully intuitive parametric method (in which all of the design variables are aerodynamically related geometrical parameters) without loss of the accuracy and flexibility of the class/shape function transformation method for the airfoils tested.",52,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051872,"In this study, a method for reducing the jet noise of a high-speed jet is presented. An array of microjets was immersed within the centerline of an underexpanded Mach 1.6 jet in an effort to reduce the overall sound pressure level and alter its spectral composition. Based on the mass flux through the microjets and the location of the microjets along the centerline of the jet, reductions of up to 5.81 dB with respect to the downstream direction and 7.99 dB with respect to the perpendicular direction can be achieved. An interesting phenomenon is discovered whereby the maximum noise reduction in the downstream direction is found with injection activated, whereas the maximum noise reduction in the perpendicular direction is found with injection deactivated. Placement of the injection tube within the flow is shown to eradicate distinct tones while flow visualizations depicted a strong augmentation in the jet plume via a modification of the shear layer and the internal shock cell structure.",52,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051815,"A novel dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator configuration for flow control is employed on open cavities to evaluate the potential for aeroacoustic tonal noise reduction. Instead of a planar configuration, the actuator is designed around the cavity opening edges. The investigation focuses on its effectiveness in terms of tonal noise suppression and the associated fluid dynamics. The investigated cavities have a square cross section. A low-Mach-number flow with a thin laminar boundary layer introduces tonal sound emission due to fluid dynamic feedback. Both upstream-mounted and downstream-mounted corner actuators have been tested, where the resulting body force is directed either into or out of the cavity. The upstream-mounted actuators influence cavity tonal feedback. An inward-inducing actuator suppresses the cavity tone up to a freestream velocity of . An outward-inducing actuator influenced mode switching. Downstream-mounted actuators did not influence the cavity aeroacoustics. Particle image velocimetry is used to investigate the fluid dynamics. The actuator induces velocities up to for an applied voltage of 15 kV at 4 kHz. The induced velocity is directed perpendicular to the freestream direction. A secondary circulating flow is developed in the cavity, which modifies the fluid dynamic feedback mechanism.",52,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052285,"Accurate and efficient computation of multimode/broadband noise propagating into and radiating out of a duct has both fundamental and practical interests, particularly for broadband turbofan noise problems. In this work, a new complex formulation of the linearized Euler equations is proposed in the time domain for accurate and efficient multimode noise computations via a single-mode summation approach. The approach achieves incoherent results by summation of individual predictions from excitation modes at all discrete frequencies. The solutions are obtained using high-order computational aeroacoustics algorithms. An advantage of the proposed formulation is that the number of computations is equal to the cuton mode number at the highest frequency regardless of the frequency sampling rate. Furthermore, the computation cost only increases marginally despite a doubling of the governing equations in real space. Tests show that the method could potentially achieve significant computational cost savings. This approach is compared with a time-domain random phase approach with which incoherent results are obtained by averaging the results from repeated simulations with random phases added to the wave inputs in each computation. Examples including a generic bypass engine duct are included to illustrate the reliability and efficiency of the method.",52,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052550,"The flowfield and sound generated by turbulent flow passing over the trailing edge of an airfoil was studied experimentally. The airfoil geometries considered were thin, flat models that provided canonical, zero-pressure-gradient, turbulent boundary layers upstream of the trailing edge. The Reynolds number based on the chord was . A trailing edge with a symmetric, tapered, sharp edge was studied first. This allowed the use of a simple scattering theory to predict the radiated sound based on boundary-layer surface pressure. Second, a series of blunt, asymmetric, trailing-edge models were studied. The lower surface of the edge was flat, while the upper surface was rounded with a 45 deg trailing-edge angle. Three models were considered, which provided a variation in the ratio of model thickness to thickness of the approach boundary layer. Particle image velocimetry measurements were obtained to provide insight into the local flowfield dynamics that generated the sound. Acoustic measurements from the blunt edges indicated that the high-frequency sound primarily resulted from scattering from the lower surface. At lower frequency, the radiated sound was found to have significantly higher amplitude compared to the sharp-edged case. This was caused by the large-scale motions in the wake resulting from the separated flow at the trailing edge. In the case of where the boundary layers were thin compared to the trailing edge, discrete vortex shedding and tonal sound were observed. When the boundary layers were thicker, the elevated sound levels were broadband.",52,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051848,"The present paper investigates a time-domain harmonic balance method as an alternative to classical time-marching schemes for stability studies of turbomachineries toward flutter. A weak-coupling approach is applied, which requires computing the fluid response to prescribed harmonic motions of the structure. The harmonic balance method, formulated in the arbitrary Lagrangian/Eulerian framework, is adapted to single-passage reduction using phase-lag boundary conditions expressed purely in the time domain. Validation against experimental data for the 11th standard configuration for aeroelasticity is performed, showing good agreement. Finally, an industrial test case is presented: a fan designed by Safran Snecma. The results show the good accuracy of the proposed harmonic balance method as well as significant reductions in computational time.",52,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052633,"Unsteady aerodynamics imposes additional demands on the modeling of vertical axis wind turbines. Large variations in the angles of attack of the blades cause force oscillations, which can lead to the fatigue-associated problems. Therefore, an accurate estimation of the dynamic loads is essential for the vertical axis wind turbines design. Dynamic stall modeling is in focus because it represents complex phenomena associated with the unsteady flow conditions. The purpose of the study is to find a suitable dynamic stall model for the vertical axis wind turbine conditions. Three versions of the Leishman–Beddoes model are explicitly presented. Additional modifications are implemented for the model to work when the angles of attack change sign and have high amplitudes. All the model parameters are presented. The model is assessed against measured data. The conditions for the simulation tests are close to the vertical axis wind turbine operational conditions. A version of the model, originally designed for low Mach numbers, is the most accurate throughout a number of tests.",52,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052071,"Theoretically discussed and analytically compared are four structural paradigms for the isotropic stretching of circular membrane apertures with three-point tensioning of regular (120 deg) symmetry. These are 1) a film triangle with parabolic catenary systems on the sides, 2) a circular arc-triangular sheet with edge cables, 3) the latter with circular corner cutouts, and 4) directly tensioning the film disk around the circumference with radial catenaries, as here named. The last two are newly proposed to increase structural efficiency: to reduce suspension forces for a given support system footprint (equivalently, to reduce the support footprint for given suspension loads). Mechanics and geometries are rigorously formulated with key design relations symbolically derived. Of the four options, the radial catenary is found with a wide margin to be the most efficient, followed by the arc-circular perimeter with corner cutouts. The parabolic catenary is next, with simple arc-circular perimeter cables being the least efficient. Finally, derivative configuration options and some hardware engineering considerations are briefly touched upon. The latter include quantitative impact on support structure mass, physical feasibility, and system design concerns.",52,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052477,"The efficiency of air microblowing through a wall consisting of alternating permeable and impermeable sections to reduce the turbulent skin-friction drag of a flat plate in a nominally gradientless incompressible flow was studied experimentally. The mass flow rate of the air per unit area was varied in the range from 0 to , which corresponds to the maximum blowing coefficient equal to 0.00287. In the previous study of the authors (Kornilov, V. I., and Boiko, A. V., “Efficiency of Air Microblowing Through Microperforated Wall for Flat Plate Drag Reduction,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 50, No. 3, 2012, pp. 724–732.), it was found in particular that there exists a wide flow region of reduced skin friction downstream from the microperforated insert. Therefore, the main attention in the present study is paid to distributed boundary-layer characteristics and efficiency of the given control technique supplemented with forced impermeable surface sections to reduce energy cost. Excluding the impermeable sections, a consistent reduction of the skin-friction coefficient along the chord of the perforated insert was found, the reduction achieving 71% at maximum value of the blowing coefficient. It is also shown that the microblowing with the same airflow rate as at completely permeable surface is able to provide the flat-plate total drag reduction of about 15–25%.",52,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052274,"The physics of control by pulsed blowing on a NACA natural laminar flow airfoil is studied using hot-film anemometry. Measurements in the uncontrolled separated shear layer indicate that vortex shedding is taking place due to the Kelvin–Helmholtz-type inviscid instability. Steady and pulsed external acoustic excitation is used as well to decouple the frequency content of the perturbation from the vorticity introduced by the jet. Acoustic control introduces either the most unstable frequency or harmonics of carrier frequency in the most unstable range, which amplify exponentially in the separation region yielding a significant delay of the separation location to approximately 55% chord. Experimental data suggest that pulsed jets introduce higher-order harmonics of the low-frequency pulsing as well, amplifying the natural disturbances in the laminar separation. Phase-averaged wavelet analysis is used to study the control physics within a single pulsing period. It is shown that a jet-induced high-frequency content convects downstream of the jets at approximately the freestream velocity. A second packet of jet-induced frequency content is convected inside the boundary layer at a slower speed. As the second packet interacts with the laminar separation, natural vortex shedding is enhanced. The vortex shedding induces momentum near the wall and temporarily calms the separation. After the convected turbulent structures have passed, vortex shedding subsides, and the boundary layer briefly loses momentum near the wall until the next set of structures return.",52,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052429,"Recent flow measurements have been acquired in the National Transonic Facility to assess the test-section unsteady flow environment. The primary purpose of the test is to determine the feasibility of the facility to conduct laminar-flow-control testing and boundary-layer transition-sensitive testing at flight-relevant operating conditions throughout the transonic Mach number range. The facility can operate in two modes, warm and cryogenic test conditions for testing full and semispan-scaled models. Data were acquired for Mach and unit Reynolds numbers ranging from and collectively at air and cryogenic conditions. Measurements were made in the test section using a survey rake that was populated with 19 probes. Roll polar data at selected conditions were obtained to look at the uniformity of the flow disturbance field in the test section. Data acquired included mean total temperatures, mean and fluctuating static/total pressures, and mean and fluctuating hot-wire measurements. This paper focuses primarily on the unsteady pressure and hot-wire results. Based on the current measurements and previous data, an assessment was made that the facility may be a suitable facility for ground-based demonstrations of laminar-flow technologies at flight-relevant conditions in the cryogenic mode.",52,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051647,"A nonlinear, low-order physics-based model for the dynamics of forced convection wall heat transfer in pulsating flow is formulated, based on the proper orthogonal decomposition technique. In a multivariate approach, proper orthogonal decomposition modes are constructed from computational fluid dynamics data for laminar flow and heat transfer over a flat plate in pulsating flow, spanning a range of pulsation frequencies and amplitudes. Then, the conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy are projected onto the proper orthogonal decomposition modes, such that a system of ordinary differential equations for the modal amplitudes is obtained. The forcing at the inlet is written explicitly in the ordinary differential equations of the low-order model. The contribution of the nonvanishing pressure term resulting from the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is included with a calibration method. The accuracy and stability of the low-order model are evaluated by comparison with computational fluid dynamics data. Possible applications of this heat source model to the computation of a describing function or the prediction of limit cycle amplitudes of thermoacoustic instabilities are discussed.",52,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052315,"Time-resolved particle image velocimetry measurements were made in the turbulent flow environment below a hovering rotor near a ground plane that was covered with mobile sediment particles. The results were compared to the near-wall flow produced by a nominally equivalent two-dimensional wall jet. The objective was to understand the fluid dynamic mechanisms of how the mean flow, stochastic turbulence, and concentrated vorticity produced by the rotor affected the mobilization and pickup of particles from the bed. Another objective was to better understand the assumptions that would be required for the development of models that are applicable to rotor-induced particle mobilization. The mean flow in the boundary layer at the ground below the rotor was found to be similar to a wall jet. However, the instantaneous flowfield and turbulence characteristics between the two flows were significantly different. Measurements of the heterogeneous dual-phase flow environment using particle image and particle tracking velocimetry exposed the complex interplay between the carrier and dispersed phases of the flow. The turbulence characteristics were clearly modified by the presence of particles in the near-wall region. The processes of particle mobilization and pickup from the bed were found to correlate with the Reynolds stresses and discrete turbulence events, respectively.",52,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052383,"The expansion tube is the only type of ground test facility currently able to simulate high-Mach-number scramjet test flows. These access-to-space flow conditions are characterized by total pressures of the order of gigapascals. The University of Queensland’s X2 expansion tube facility has recently been used to generate scramjet flow conditions between Mach 10 and 14, relevant to a 96 kPa dynamic pressure ascent trajectory, with total pressures up to 10 GPa. These experiments have matched flight enthalpy and Mach number while achieving test flow static pressures considerably higher than the true flight values. This demonstrates that Reynolds number can also be matched, even for subscale models, thereby addressing one of the major challenges for ground testing of high-Mach-number scramjet design concepts. The routine operation of expansion tubes at high flight enthalpies has already been established; but for operation at lower enthalpies (relevant to scramjet testing), the wave processes within these machines become more tightly coupled and difficult to tune. This paper details the combined analytical and numerical processes used to develop new flow conditions in the X2 facility. Experimental results are presented, and axisymmetric computational fluid dynamics analysis is used to fully characterize the test flow properties.",52,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052168,"An analytical solution for the fully coupled structural-acoustic response of a thin elastic plate mounted in a rectangular duct assuming linear dynamics is presented. The plate is subjected to harmonic planar acoustic waves at grazing incidence in the presence of a subsonic uniform mean flow in the duct. Both clamped and simply supported plates are considered. Regimes are identified in which the structural-acoustic coupling plays a significant role on the response of the plate. Four metrics characterizing the coupled response are considered: the deviation of the peak response frequency from the in vacuo natural frequency of plate, the amplitude of the peak response, the effective acoustic damping of the plate, and the plate intermodal coupling through the duct acoustic field. For a typical aerospace structure, the plate-fluid coupling does little to change the fundamental vibration frequencies from their in vacuo values but significantly alters the amplitudes of the plate vibration. This is a result of the acoustic radiation being a strong function of the in-duct flow Mach number . Further, the intermodal coupling through the acoustic field is also a strong function of . Therefore, reduced-order models relying on the panel’s in vacuo modes require Mach-number-dependent coupling coefficients for accurate predictions.",52,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052871,"Traditional uncertainty quantification in simulation-based analyses typically focuses upon the quantification of parametric uncertainties: the uncertainties inherent to the input parameters of the simulation. This type of uncertainty often represents the inherent variability of natural systems due to incomplete information or implicit variations in the system itself. However, when simulation-based models are used to evaluate the performance of a system, an additional level of uncertainty is introduced (one often not rigorously considered in probabilistic design): modeling-induced uncertainty. This work adapts uncertainty quantification for the multiple forms of uncertainties into a single framework to quantify the uncertainty in an analysis from not only the inherent variability of the parameters but also the uncertainties induced by the modeling process itself. By using Bayesian statistics, a stochastic representation of model results can be constructed in the presence of given data. These data can then be used to drive rigorous reduction and selection of models among a model set that most accurately represent the given physical scenario. The utility and application of such an approach will be demonstrated on a transonic aeroelastic flutter analysis for the Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development 445.6 wing.",52,1
