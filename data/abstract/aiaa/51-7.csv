0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J050899,"For an optical system carried by a helicopter, aero-optic aberrations originate primarily from blade tip vortices that pass through the system field of view. These aberrations result from the reduced pressure and density in the vortex cores, and the associated variations in the index of refraction. As part of an investigation into the full aero-optic environment surrounding a helicopter, this paper describes an investigation into the optical character of a single tip vortex. The Lamb–Oseen vortex model is used to compute realistic velocity fields, which are then used with the energy equation to determine thermodynamic properties. The resulting aero-optic data are used to calibrate a scaling law that is derived from the basic fluid-mechanic equations of motion, and this scaling law is validated against experimental data. The scaling relationship is then used to make a simple estimate of the vortex-induced aberrations on a fuselage-mounted optical system for a medium-sized helicopter.",51,7

Three flow configurations at a Mach number of and at an angle of attack of are analyzed to show the impact of the fluid-structure interaction on the overall flow structure: the flow over a fixed DRA 2303, the flow over a DRA 2303 undergoing flow-induced motion, and the flow over a DRA 2303 experiencing a forced sinusoidal heave/pitch motion at frequencies in the range of the natural buffet frequency of the airfoil. The results are analyzed regarding the origin and nature of the unsteady shock-boundary-layer interaction, the fluid-structure response behavior, and the influence of the structural motion on the shock oscillation. For the buffet flow, the shock motion is determined by the sound pressure level generated at the trailing edge. At buffet conditions, the frequency of the self-sustained airfoil motion is in the same range as the natural buffet frequency. At forced oscillation at excitation frequencies in the buffet range, the shock oscillation locks into the excitation frequency indeed, but the sound-wave-based feedback loop is hardly influenced by the airfoil motion.",51,7
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051553,"Two different passive flow control strategies were investigated for a modified NACA airfoil at a chord-based Reynolds number of and an angle of attack of . For these conditions, the laminar boundary layer separates from the suction side, resulting in a loss of lift and a drag increase. Distributed roughness elements with roughness Reynolds numbers of and 446 that were mounted near the leading edge and scalloped leading edges with serration amplitudes of 5 and 0.5% of the chord were considered. The large roughness elements and the scalloped leading edge reduce the flow separation and enhance performance. The flow physics are, however, different. For , the roughness elements result in high-frequency shedding. The shedding results in an accelerated transition of the separated boundary layer. For the scalloped leading edge with 5% serration amplitude, laminar separation bubbles are situated in the leading-edge troughs. The turbulent wedges that originate from these bubbles coalesce near midchord. For a serration amplitude of 0.5%, the separation line is deformed in the spanwise direction in a manner that is reminiscent of stall cells.",51,7
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051677,"A detailed three-dimensional numerical simulation was conducted to investigate the flow and -air mixing characteristics in a scramjet engine with two intake sidewalls and a cavity flameholder. Turbulence closure was achieved using a model that combines the low-Reynolds-number two-equation model and Sarkar and Wilcox’s compressible turbulent-correction model. The governing equations were solved numerically by means of a finite volume, preconditioned flux-differencing scheme. Cases of with and without intake sidewalls were considered. Intake sidewalls were found to strongly affect the inlet flow structure, which became more complex in the nonuniform flowfield on the cross section perpendicular to the engine axis. The complex and nonuniform flow affected the -air mixing pattern inside the combustion chamber, unlike the pattern of the case of without sidewalls. To verify the accuracy of the simulation, the computed wall pressure was compared with the experimental data. Mixing efficiency and fuel-propagation rate were evaluated for the two cases of with and without sidewalls. The mixing efficiency of the sidewall case is slightly larger than the other case through the combustor, but the fuel spreads toward the combustor center and forms a relatively narrower fuel region with higher equivalence ratio.",51,7
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051784,"An analytical model for the rotor–stator broadband noise is improved by accounting for the rotor acoustic shielding. Both the analytical models for the stator broadband noise and for the rotor scattering are strip-theory approaches based on previously published formulations of the three-dimensional unsteady blade loading for a rectilinear cascade. Specific treatment is introduced to address the behavior around the cut on frequency of the duct modes both in the noise generation and in the noise scattering. A simple effect of the swirl between the rotor and the stator is considered using a Doppler shift in frequency. The power spectral density of the acoustic power and the sound pressure level at the duct wall are studied for the NASA source diagnostic test fan rig. The separate effects of the shielding by a cascade of the rotation of the rotor and of the swirl are investigated. Corotating modes dominate in the inlet. The rotor shielding decreases the acoustic power at intermediate frequencies but increases it at higher frequencies because of the frequency scattering and of the scattering in radial mode orders, which does not exist in a fully rectilinear model. The swirl has a strong effect that must be included.",51,7

The simulations compute the complex interaction of the supersonic jet with the flat impingement plane and directly provide the noise generated by this interaction. Two jet-operating temperatures, which correspond to isothermal and heated conditions, are considered in the simulations. The simulation results from both cases are examined to investigate the intense tonal noise generation arising from the jet impingement. The comparisons between the simulation results and the corresponding experimental measurements generally show a reasonable agreement and provide credibility to the quality of the simulation predictions. The simulations reveal important details about the problem of interest, which are not observable from the experiments. A dynamic mode decomposition is performed to identify the dynamically important modes of the supersonic impinging-jet flowfield for the simulated conditions. The most dominant mode of the flowfield is found to possess a temporal frequency that corresponds to the fundamental impingement tone frequency. Coherent nearly axisymmetric structures in the flowfield are also identified, which are generated at the fundamental impingement tone frequency.",51,7
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051831,"In this paper, a simple but effective design for implementing a negative wing twist in a beetle-mimicking wing system is presented. The effectiveness of the design in terms of force generation and power consumption is confirmed by both experiment and calculation. An unsteady blade-element-theory model is used to estimate the aerodynamic forces produced by two different wing kinematics of a flapping-wing system. The model was first validated with the measurement data and two three-dimensional computational-fluid-dynamics results from the literature. The difference between the estimated average lift and the measured lift is 5.6%, which proves that the unsteady blade-element-theory model provides reasonable aerodynamic force estimation. The time history of the current estimation is also close to the measured data and is in between the two computational-fluid-dynamics results. The forces generated by the flapping wings with and without wing twist are estimated using the unsteady blade-element theory to investigate effect of the wing twist on the force generation. The result shows that the flapping-wing system with wing twist produces a 9.5% larger average vertical force or thrust while consuming 37% less power than the flapping-wing system without wing twist. The measured thrust by the swing test also shows 13.2% increase for the flapping wing with wing twist. Thus, by the estimation and measurement, it is confirmed that the wing twist improves the thrust generation.",51,7

This concept, known as a turbine burner, introduces certain challenges concerning the injection, mixing, ignition, and burning of fuel within a short residence time in a turbine passage characterized by large three-dimensional accelerations. Here, the injection of the fuel into a cavity adjacent to the modeled turbine passage is examined, which creates a low-speed zone for mixing and flameholding. The turbine passage is modeled as a converging and curving channel flow of high-temperature vitiated air adjacent to a cavity. To give a broader understanding of the cavity channel-flow coupling, both constant-area and converging channels with both straight and curving centerlines are modeled. Three-dimensional unsteady calculations with periodic port injection are performed, examining the effects of channel convergence and curvature, and injection configurations. These direct simulations address flows with Reynolds-number values up to 2000. Calculations show that converging channels reduce the combustion efficiency. Channel curvature can be either beneficial or detrimental to combustion efficiency, depending on the location of the cavity, and the fuel- and air-injection configuration. Injecting fuel and air so as to disrupt the natural rotation of the fluid in the cavity stimulates three-dimensional instability and improves the combustion efficiency.",51,7

The aerodynamic coefficients are analyzed based on visualized flowfields and theoretical results. The characteristics of high-aspect-ratio wings are shown to be affected by leading-edge separation bubbles at low Reynolds numbers. However, the qualitative characteristics are similar when the aspect ratio is 3.0 and above. The characteristics of wings with aspect ratios below 3.0 differ significantly from those of wings with large aspect ratios. In particular, a significant influence is revealed for aspect ratios of 1.0 and below. The effect of the aspect ratio is considered to be caused by wingtip vortices. The discussion also includes the effects of the Reynolds number, the shape of the leading edge, and the thickness ratio.",51,7
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051939,"A series of fluid–structure interaction simulations of an aerodynamic tension-cone supersonic decelerator prototype intended for large mass payload deployment in planetary explorations are discussed. The fluid–structure interaction computations combine large deformation analysis of thin shells with large-eddy simulation of compressible turbulent flows using a loosely coupled approach to enable quantification of the dynamics of the vehicle. The simulation results are compared with experiments carried out at the NASA Glenn Research Center. Reasonably good agreement between the simulations and the experiment is observed throughout a deflation cycle. The simulations help to illuminate the details of the dynamic progressive buckling of the tension-cone decelerator that ultimately results in the collapse of the structure as the inflation pressure is decreased. Furthermore, the tension-cone decelerator exhibits a transient oscillatory behavior under impulsive loading that ultimately dies out. The frequency of these oscillations was determined to be related to the acoustic time scale in the compressed subsonic region between the bow shock and the structure. As shown, when the natural frequency of the structure and the frequency of the compressed subsonic region approximately match, the decelerator exhibits relatively large nonaxisymetric oscillations. The observed response appears to be a fluid–structure interaction resonance resulting from an acoustic chamber (pistonlike) mode exciting the structure.",51,7
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052101,"A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics study of the surface-pressure fluctuations induced by a cylindrical protuberance in a supersonic turbulent boundary layer is presented. The effects of two important parameters on the surface-pressure fluctuations are investigated: protuberance height to boundary-layer thickness and surface curvature. The turbulent boundary layer is modeled using a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and large-eddy-simulation approach known as detached-eddy simulation. At first extensive comparisons to experimental data for the surface-pressure coefficient and the unsteady surface-pressure coefficient were performed. Results from our computational-fluid-dynamics computations compared well to the experimental data in the wake region downstream of the protuberance and in the vicinity of the protuberance at other locations. Increasing the protuberance height relative to the boundary-layer thickness resulted in higher sound-pressure levels on the surface. In addition, the surface-pressure fluctuation showed more coherence in the spanwise direction ahead of the protuberance and immediately downstream of it. Increasing the surface curvature lowered the sound-pressure levels on the surface and resulted in stretched coherent structures in the spanwise direction. Convection velocities of the turbulent structures increased away from the protuberance and were in agreement with published literature.",51,7
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052054,"To predict and optimize the noise impact of aircraft traffic airframe noise needs to be described by simple but reliable acoustic models. The present work is focused on the assessment of slat noise from Airbus A340 flyover noise measurements using a ground microphone phased array. A recently developed beamforming-based deconvolution technique for moving sources is used. This methodology enables to spatially separate the various airframe noise sources over a range of more than 10 dB and to provide their individual de-Dopplerized acoustic spectra. Slat noise spectra and directivity patterns are computed for two flight velocities: 150 and 175 kt. The results are compared to predicted noise levels given by a popular semi-empirical model based on static slat noise measurements at reduced scale in a wind tunnel. Despite both numerous uncertainties of real flyover noise tests and the inaccurate reproduction of slat devices at model scale, similar characteristics of slat noise are obtained.",51,7
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052186,"A general eigenvalue theory on flow stability in turbomachinery is proposed with the emphasis on flow-instability onset. Based on this theory, a stall-inception model including the effects of complex solid geometry is developed for a multistage fan/compressors system. The capacity of the present model to predict the stall-inception point is assessed against experimental data of both a low-speed and transonic single rotor. Comparisons with a simplified two-dimensional model are performed to identify the nonnegligible effects of spanwise distribution of flowfield in a general configuration on the unstable mode of the concerned fan/compressors. It is verified that this model is capable of predicting mass flow at the stall-onset point of both subsonic and transonic flow with a reasonable accuracy, and it is sustainable in terms of computation cost for industrial application.",51,7
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052174,"This paper considers the damped transverse vibration of flexural structures. Viscous damping models available to date, such as proportional damping, suffer from the deficiency that the resulting modal damping is strongly frequency dependent, which is a situation not representative of experiments with built-up structures. The focus model addresses a viscous geometric damping term in which an internal resisting shear force is proportional to the time rate of change of the slope. Separation of variables does not lead directly to a solution of the governing partial-differential equation, although a boundary-value eigenvalue problem for free vibration can nevertheless be posed and solved. For small damping the method of weighted residuals provides an alternate approach to the development of approximate modal equations of motion and estimation of modal damping. In a discretized finite-element context the resulting damping matrix resembles the geometric stiffness matrix used to account for the effects of membrane loads on lateral stiffness. For beams having any combination of hinged and guided boundary conditions this model yields constant modal damping that is independent of frequency as well as real mode shapes. For more general boundary conditions modal damping varies somewhat, approaching the expected constant value with increasing mode number; furthermore, the mode shapes are complex. This viscous damping model should prove useful to researchers and engineers who need a simple time-domain damping model that exhibits more realistic variation of damping with frequency than the alternatives.",51,7

To minimize the possible interference of electrode installation in the boundary-layer stability a specially designed actuator with flush-mounted electrode configuration was employed. It was found that when the plasma actuator was installed at 55–60% chord location on the pressure surface a surface flow induced by the actuator stabilizes the downstream boundary-layer most significantly to suppress the strong growth of instability waves, which is responsible for the occurrence of the acoustic feedback. Consequently, suppression of the tonal trailing-edge noise was successfully achieved.",51,7
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052224,"Flying airplanes in extended formations, with separation distances of tens of wingspans, significantly improves safety while maintaining most of the fuel savings achieved in close formations. The present study investigates the impact of roll trim and compressibility at a fixed lift coefficient on the benefits of extended-formation flight. An Euler solver with adjoint-based mesh refinement combined with a wake propagation model is used to analyze a two-body echelon formation at a separation distance of 30 spans. Two geometries are examined: a simple wing and a wing-body geometry. Energy savings, quantified by both formation drag fraction and span efficiency factor, are investigated at subsonic and transonic speeds for a matrix of vortex locations. The results show that, at fixed lift and trimmed for roll, the optimal location of vortex impingement is about 10% inboard of the trailing airplane’s wing tip. Interestingly, the improvement in drag fraction is relatively robust in the vicinity of the optimal position. Over 90% of energy benefits can be obtained with a 5% variation in vertical and 10% variation in spanwise positions. Control surface deflections required to achieve roll trim reduce the benefits of formation flight by 3–5% at subsonic speeds and 9–11% at transonic speeds. Overall, simulations show peak induced drag saving for the trail aircraft are 54% in subsonic flow and 35% in transonic flow while accounting for trim.",51,7
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052225,"The present study investigates the nonlinear feedback coupling mechanism between unsteady low-Reynolds-number aerodynamics and structural response. Structural-response models addressing one-degree-of-freedom and two-degrees-of-freedom aeroelastic oscillations were coupled with an in-house-developed computational fluid dynamics code to perform large-eddy simulations for flows past a rigid airfoil in free-to-rotate and free-to-rotate-and-heave conditions at a low Reynolds number. As observed in the experiments, the numerical simulations confirmed the presence of self-sustained low-amplitude limit-cycle oscillations of a NACA 0012 airfoil. It was understood that this behavior in the transitional Reynolds-number regime resulted from the unsteadiness of the laminar boundary-layer separation and its delayed recovery when compared to the corresponding static conditions. The feedback coupling mechanism between the laminar-separation-bubble behavior and the structural response caused negative aerodynamic damping; thus, the aerodynamic forces did positive work and fed energy from the flow to the airfoil, sustaining the low-amplitude aeroelastic oscillations. The amplitude in pitch of the limit-cycle oscillations was of the order of 5–7 deg. As the operating angles of attack in unmanned-air-vehicle flights are within close range of the limit-cycle-oscillation occurrence, understanding and controlling the limit-cycle oscillation of the wings could ensure unmanned-air-vehicle stability so that it could acquire high-quality camera images and other data, for instance.",51,7
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052177,"Although the mathematical derivation of the adjoint equations and their numerical implementation is well established, there is scant discussion on the understanding of the adjoint solution by itself. As this is a field solution of similar resolution of the flowfield, there is a wealth of data that can be used for design guidance. The aim is to tie the adjoint solution to the flowfield, which has physical properties. The adjoint solution of four representative cases taken from turbomachinery aerodynamic problems are used to identify the physical insight it provides. The focus is on changes related to geometry, but the changes can also be realized using other inputs to the flow solver (e.g., boundary conditions). It is shown how the adjoint counterpart of the density and velocity field can be used to provide insights into the nature of changes the designer can induce to cause improvement in the performance metric of interest. Discussion on how to use adjoint solutions for problems with constraints to further refine the changes is also included. Finally, a turbine strut problem is discussed where it is not immediately apparent what geometry changes need to be used for further evaluation with optimization algorithms. The adjoint and flow solutions are used to determine the kind of end-wall treatments that reduce the loss. These changes are then implemented to show that the loss is actually reduced. The results in this paper show there is a twofold use of the adjoint method: one for guiding the automatic optimization as such and the second for guiding the designer in the choice of the design space.",51,7

The new terms account for atmospheric absorption and dispersion in the vicinity of the caustic. An additional term has been derived to include the effect of wind in the direction tangent to the caustic. A code was developed to numerically implement the newly derived lossy nonlinear Tricomi equation. A numerical validation verified the calculation of diffraction effects due to linear focusing at a fold caustic. A numerical check was also performed to verify the calculation of the nonlinear, absorption, and dispersion coupling using an analytical solution of lossy nonlinear propagation through a homogeneous medium. The numerical results showed good agreement with the analytical solutions. Comparisons were also made between predictions from the lossy nonlinear Tricomi equation code and focus-boom measurements from the Superboom Caustic Analysis and Measurement Program flight test funded by NASA. The lossy nonlinear Tricomi equation predictions also agreed well with the experimental data from the Superboom Caustic Analysis and Measurement Program flight-test measurements.",51,7

For the measurement campaign, an infrared mirror system is developed to allow the viewing of the leading-edge region, which was not visible from the standard optical access of the facility. The optical calibration of the camera with a special target is performed.
