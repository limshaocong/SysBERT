Under such conditions, high-aspect-ratio wings will experience some degree of structural motion. Simulations and experiments for a chord-based Reynolds number of are carried out for a wing section with an X-56A airfoil to investigate the effect of a harmonic heaving/plunging motion on the unsteady aerodynamics. The reduced frequency of the structural motion is , and the amplitude is 3.2–9.6% based on chord length. For a plunging motion at a 10 deg mean angle of attack, the unsteady lift is in good agreement with the Theodorsen theory. As the mean angle of attack is increased up to 14 deg, the flow begins to separate intermittently from the suction side of the wing. The onset of flow separation and the shedding of the resultant stall vortex depend on the frequency and amplitude of the structural motion. Steady spanwise disturbances that are introduced at the leading edge are found to strengthen the stall vortex. For a 16 deg angle of attack, the wing section is fully stalled. However, when subjected to a low-amplitude plunging motion, the flow intermittently reattaches and the mean lift is increased.",56,7
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056774,"The current study was conducted to understand flowfield unsteadiness associated with static stall hysteresis on a NACA 0012 airfoil at . Unsteady pressure measurements were acquired to evaluate the performance of the airfoil, and the presence of a hysteresis loop was identified in the vicinity of the airfoil . At poststall angles of attack, two fundamentally different flow regimes were observed between the upstroke and downstroke branches of the hysteresis loop. A Fourier analysis of the surface pressure distributions was used to attribute the flowfield unsteadiness to a low-frequency, high-amplitude oscillation in the flow near the leading edge, along with a regular bluff-body shedding frequency across the separated region of the airfoil. The low-frequency oscillations were observed to be more dominant for the upstroke branch, whereas the bluff-body shedding process was more dominant in the downstroke branch. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry data were acquired across the airfoil to qualitatively and quantitatively describe the low-frequency unsteadiness in the flow. These data were used to link the oscillations across the leading edge during the upstroke to a quasi-periodic surging of the flow, along with an advancement and retreating of the separation location across the surface.",56,7

The gust is supplied upstream of the airfoil as a counterclockwise-oriented Taylor vortex. Upon impact with the leading edge, the gust splits, causing disruptions to the boundary layer on both surfaces of the airfoil. On the upper surface, the vortical gust causes an eruption of the laminar-separation bubble into a poorly formed turbulent leading-edge vortex that becomes more coherent as it overtakes and envelopes two-dimensional instability waves downstream. The gust and leading-edge vortex propagate as a dipole and induce a pressure disturbance upon departure from the trailing edge, an event significant enough to influence the lift. Beneath the airfoil, the lower section of the gust thickens the boundary layer and causes breakup into a series of spanwise coherent vortices. Both leading-edge vortex formation and lower boundary-layer disruption produce notable acoustic radiation. Three different initial vertical positions are considered for a counterclockwise-oriented gust. Gust position affects boundary-layer disruption such that higher encounters elicit a more coherent leading-edge vortex and lower encounters exhibit stronger lower-surface instabilities. All cases exhibit significant acoustic radiation emanating from the aforementioned flow transition events.",56,7
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055825,"A hybrid computational aeroacoustics method is applied to investigate the effect of wavy leading edges on rod–airfoil interaction noise. The flow field is solved by an incompressible large-eddy simulation. The acoustic far-field is predicted using the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings acoustic analogy. NACA 0012 airfoils with straight and wavy leading edges (denoted by SLE and WLE, respectively) are located one chord downstream of a circular rod. The free-stream Mach number is 0.2 and the Reynolds number based on the rod diameter is 48,000. The present numerical method is first validated by existing experimental and numerical results for the SLE case. Then, both the sound pressure level and sound power level of the SLE and WLE cases are computed to assess the noise reduction effect. A considerable noise reduction level is obtained in the mid- to high-frequency range. The main noise reduction mechanisms of the WLE are investigated in detail. The surface pressure fluctuations along the leading edge of the WLE airfoil exhibit a significant attenuation compared with the SLE counterpart, which leads to reduced sound source levels. It is also found that there exist spanwise decorrelation and decoherence effects along the leading edge of the WLE case, which means a noise reduction effect according to Amiet’s theory. Phase interference effect is also found along the WLE geometry and this effect is conjectured to be a more essential noise reduction mechanism, because the trends of the phase-shift spectrum are almost consistent with the noise-reduction spectrum.",56,7
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056743,"Regardless of the plant model, robust flow estimation based on limited measurements remains a major challenge in successful flow control applications. Aiming to combine the robustness of a high-dimensional representation of the dynamics with the cost efficiency of a low-order approximation of the state covariance matrix, a flow state estimator based on the ensemble Kalman filter is applied to two-dimensional flow past a cylinder and an airfoil at high angle of attack and low Reynolds number. For development purposes, the numerical algorithm is used as both the estimator and as a surrogate for the measurements. Estimation is successful using a reduced number of either pressure sensors on the surface of the body or sparsely placed velocity probes in the wake. Because the most relevant features of these flows are restricted to a low-dimensional manifold of the state space, asymptotic behavior of the estimator is shown to be achieved with a small ensemble size. The relative importance of each sensor location is evaluated by analyzing how they influence the estimated flowfield, and optimal locations for pressure sensors are determined. Covariance inflation is used to enhance the estimator performance in the presence of unmodeled freestream perturbations. A combination of parametric modeling and augmented state methodology is used to successfully estimate the forces on immersed bodies subjected to deterministic and random gusts.",56,7

The difficulty is associated with reliable prediction of laminar–turbulence transition and reasonable compromise of viscous and wave drags. This paper proposes to use efficient global optimization based on surrogate models to address this problem. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow solver features automatic transition prediction via a full method, in which dual factors are used for Tollmien–Schlichting and crossflow instabilities, respectively. The optimizer is based on the kriging surrogate model and parallel infill-sampling method. The baseline natural-laminar-flow wing for short- and medium-range transport aircraft is designed at a cruise Mach number 0.75. Then, drag minimization with up to 42 design variables is carried out, and significant drag reduction (8.79%) has been achieved. A close examination of the optimal wing shows that the drag reduction mainly comes from shock-wave weakening on the upper surface and laminar flow extending via suppression of crossflow instability on the lower surface. Robustness of the optimal wing is investigated, and multipoint optimization is further exercised to improve the robustness to the Mach number variation. It is demonstrated that surrogate-based optimization is feasible and effective for aerodynamic shape optimization of transonic natural-laminar-flow wings.",56,7

The techniques of the design of experiments are therefore applied in order to formally optimize the selection of calibration points. A model is proposed for a generalized directional velocity probe, and this model is used to generate an approximate, polynomial response surface model that is shown to agree well with measurements from both multisensor hot-wire probes and multihole pressure probes, in a variety of geometries. The process of D optimality is then applied based on this response surface model, and a typical probe is calibrated accordingly. The probe is then used to scan the wake of a vortex generator in order to test the efficacy of the reduced calibrations. D-optimal calibration points are shown to offer a significant improvement in data fidelity over conventional rectangular grids, and minimal additional uncertainty is incurred after a 25-fold reduction in the number of calibration points.",56,7
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056678,"The Reshotko–Tumin transition criterion based on optimal transient growth successfully correlates laboratory measurements of roughness-induced transition over blunt-body configurations. Even though transient growth has not been conclusively linked to the measured onset of transition, the correlation denotes the only available physics-based model for subcritical transition in blunt-body flows, since the latter do not support any modal instabilities at typical experimental conditions. Unlike other established models based on empirical curve fits that are valid for a specific subclass of datasets, the optimal-growth-based transition criterion appears to provide a reasonable correlation with measurements in various wind tunnel and ballistic-range facilities and for a broad range of surface-temperature ratios. This paper is focused on optimal-growth calculations that improve upon significant shortcomings of the computations underlying the Reshotko–Tumin correlation. The improved framework is applied to leeward transition over a spherical-section forebody. The computed results highlight the significance of nonparallel basic-state evolution, curvature terms, and an optimization procedure that varies both inflow and outflow locations of the interval. More importantly, the results indicate that the modified correlation is very close to its original form and hence that the accuracy of the transient-growth-based transition criterion is not compromised by using a more thorough theoretical framework. Yet the results also show that the optimal energy gain up to the predicted transition onset location can be rather small, highlighting the need to further investigate the optimal-growth criterion for additional experimental configurations and to also uncover the in-depth physics underlying blunt-body transition.",56,7

A stability analysis that includes the effect of swirl along with mass and heat transfer is presented. In this paper, the ratio between conduction heat flux and evaporation heat flux characterizes the heat transfer at the interface. This work examines the effect of various nondimensional parameters on the instability of the flow. When the ratio of the conduction heat flux to the evaporation heat flux increases, the growth rate increases and the wave number remains unchanged. Although the confinement increases, the stability of the liquid varies from its condition without heat and mass transfer.",56,7
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056497,"Computations of all-speed multiphase real fluid flows for aerospace launch vehicles are known to be very demanding, owing to several issues that include robust capturing of two-phase shock/phase discontinuity and proper scaling of numerical flux at steady/unsteady all-speed flows. This paper deals with the development of computational components to overcome difficulties arising from these issues. First, the shock-discontinuity-sensing term used in the two-phase and RoeM schemes is modified because the existing shock-discontinuity-sensing term is not suitable for complex equation of state of real fluids. The accuracy of the two-phase and RoeM schemes for unsteady low-Mach-number flows is then improveed through separate scaling of the velocity- and pressure-difference terms. It is demonstrated that the resulting schemes are capable of robustly and accurately capturing phenomena involving shock and phase discontinuities and interactions between them for numerous two-phase problems. Finally, numerical simulations of cryogenic cavitation and three-dimensional cavitating flows around the Korea Aerospace Research Institute turbopump are presented to confirm accurate and robust behavior of the proposed approaches in computations of multiphase real fluid flows at all speeds.",56,7
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056668,"Thermoacoustic instability of n-decane at subcritical pressure in a small-scale channel is investigated from three aspects: the flow pattern, the fluctuations of temperature and pressure, and the dynamic model. The results show that the thermoacoustic instability is a type of dynamic instability and experiences three stages: that is, appearance, development, and disappearance. Oscillations happen for the pressure drop, fluid temperature, and wall temperature when thermoacoustic instability appears. The thermoacoustic instability is driven by a positive and a negative feedback. When the outlet oil temperature reaches saturation temperature, the positive feedback loop is on, and the thermoacoustic oscillation happens. After that, the flow pattern near the outlet recovers to annular flow and then transforms to a single-gas flow, which leads the thermoacoustic oscillation to happen again.",56,7
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056886,"The present work investigates the effect of discrete surface roughness, which falls in the transitionally rough regime, on the near-wall velocity fields of a smooth-wall turbulent boundary layer with zero pressure gradient. A spanwise array of cylindrical elements, whose diameters were and heights were , were attached onto the wall with spanwise spacing of . Three roughness Reynolds numbers , 1000, and 1500 were studied, and the ratio between the roughness height and the boundary-layer thickness was . Two-dimensional velocity fields in multiple wall-parallel planes at were measured by two-dimensional particle image velocimetry. For each case, it is found that roughness elements always introduce -shaped low-speed regions in the near-wall mean velocity fields by direct wake interaction, in the downstream of which a phase shift occurs to form one high-speed mean streak with reduced streamwise velocity fluctuation intensity behind each roughness element, marking the onset of the modulation effect on the mean velocity fields. Further analysis on the swirling strength fields suggests that such a modulation effect can be attributed to the roughness-introduced streamwise vortex pairs, which compete with hairpin vortices shedding from the top of the roughness elements and promote the phase shift in a bottom-up way.",56,7
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056751,"A coordinated experimental/computational study of synthetic jet-based flow control on a vertical tail/rudder assembly has been carried out on a 1/19th-scale model operating at 30 deg rudder deflection, 0 deg sideslip, and a Reynolds number of 350,000. Under these conditions, a very strong spanwise separated flow develops over the rudder surface for a majority of its span. Twelve synthetic jets were distributed across the span of the vertical tail just upstream of the rudder hinge line to determine their ability to reduce flow separation, thereby increasing the side-force production and rudder effectiveness. The current study provides a detailed comparison between the experiments and delayed detached-eddy simulation computations for the baseline flow and the case where one jet is active. Specifically, the origin of the strong spanwise flow close to the rudder surface is detailed for the baseline case. For the one jet active case, the positive effects of the jet on the separated flow are described through a complex phenomenon that resembles the root separation. Finally, the capacity of the delayed detached-eddy simulation turbulence model to capture the physics of the baseline and forced cases and predict the resulting side force is validated with respect to corresponding experiments.",56,7
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056689,"Numerical investigations of the leading-edge sawtooth spoiler and slanted aft wall were performed to explore the mechanisms of the suppression of pressure fluctuations in an open-type cavity flow, focusing on the pressure fluctuation spectra and their spatial distributions. The rectangular cavity has a length-to-depth ratio of six, and the freestream Mach number is 1.5. Improved delayed detached-eddy simulation was used to predict the unsteady cavity flows and pressure fluctuations. Both control methods exhibited effectiveness in pressure fluctuation suppression, but their respective mechanisms are quite different. It was observed that the leading-edge sawtooth spoiler lifts the shear layer and reduces its interaction with the aft wall. The energy distribution of Rossiter modes changes significantly, which indicates that the pressure fluctuation feedback loop inside the cavity has changed. However, the slanted aft wall merely alters the cavity flowfield. Unlike the leading-edge method, the Rossiter mode distribution and the feedback mechanism remain unchanged. The slanted aft wall mainly suppresses the upstream-traveling perturbation generated by the cavity trailing edge but has little influence on the downstream-traveling perturbation.",56,7

Unique aspects of the low-pressure turbine flow environment such as freestream turbulence, secondary flows, and unsteady wakes create challenges for flow control that must be considered during design and implementation.

Three measurement techniques were employed to measure the frequency spectrum of flow perturbations: a high-frequency Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor (aerooptical method), high-frequency PCB™ pressure sensors, and a laser differential interferometer. The magnitude and frequency of flow oscillations measured by all three methods provide comprehensive and complementary results in determining spectra of gas disturbances within the flow. Of these measurement methods, the Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor is shown to be the most suitable tool for analysis of the high-speed flow. Aerooptical measurements detect modification to the flow structure when plasma actuation is employed or when is varied. In this work, flow characterization by the Shack–Hartmann sensor at individual points over the ramp has shown three flow regimes depending on the unit Reynolds number: turbulent, transitional, and laminar. At higher , the freestream disturbances become strong enough to significantly affect the perturbations in the boundary-layer and the separation zone on the compression ramp. Frequency spectrum measurements during high-frequency plasma actuation indicate amplification of the perturbations from the natural state that occur over the separation region.",56,7

Four shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction cases are considered, corresponding to transitional and turbulent interactions for two different shock strengths, corresponding to flow-deflection angles and . It is found that significant separation is not evident in the mean flow of any interaction; the boundary layer remains attached at and close to incipient separation at , independent of the state of the incoming boundary layer. The extent of the interaction is larger for the transitional flow cases, characterized by a wider spreading of the wall pressure rise and a slower boundary-layer recovery.

17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056239,"The ballistic wave is a shock wave generated by a solid body moving at supersonic speed in the atmosphere. It sounds like the crack of a whip for small projectiles and like a detonation (sonic boom) for large-sized objects. Their common signature is a N-shaped pressure profile, the formalism of which is well known but presents a practical difficulty, namely, the calculation of the shape factor, which characterizes the aerodynamic behavior of the object flying at supersonic speed. In the present Paper, we present that calculation for simple geometric shapes defined by their algebraic equations, by using both numerical and analytical approaches. The results do not seem realistic in some cases of round-tipped shapes, which leads us to adopt, in general, a simplified form for the shape factor, different from what is sometimes used in the literature. On the other hand, such an approach suggests to us to take into account separately the ogival length and the overall length of the body. To compare classic and improved models, examples of ballistic-wave calculation are given for some bullets and small-caliber shells of which the shape is roughly defined. Finally, it appears interesting to test these models on a larger scale by simulating the sonic boom of the Apollo Command Module during its atmospheric reentry and the sonic boom of the F-104 Starfighter in horizontal flight. The results obtained seem to justify the improvements proposed for the theoretical model of ballistic wave and sonic boom arising from flying objects of simple geometry.",56,7

The prediction is achieved through three main steps: searching for the position of the sound source along the flight path, predicting the near-field waveform by a combination of computational fluid dynamics simulations on structured and unstructured meshes, and propagating this waveform to the far field by a numerical solver of the augmented Burgers equation. It is shown that this framework successfully predicts sonic boom signatures observed during the large-scale first phase of the drop test for simplified evaluation of the nonsymmetrically distributed sonic boom field test recently conducted by our research group at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency for both conventional waves and lower-amplitude flattop waveforms.",56,7

Under the magnetogasdynamics assumptions and at low magnetic Reynolds numbers, a current continuity equation is employed instead of the system of Maxwell equations to obtain the induced electric field. The flow can be modeled by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, and the electromagnetic body force and joule heating resulting from the imposed magnetic field introduced through source terms. Both inviscid and viscous flows over a sphere, as well as an Apollo-like reentry capsule geometry, are used to validate the approach. For both geometries, inviscid and viscous results show that the shock standoff distance increases with the magnetic-field intensity, whereas the heat flux at the stagnation point decreases. Moreover, it is observed that the induced electric field has a substantial impact on the effectiveness of magnetohydrodynamic heat shield and cannot be neglected in the calculations.

An incompressible flow simulation of a simplified heating, ventilation, and air conditioning outlet geometry is set up using a finite volume solver. Aeroacoustic sources are calculated on a finite volume grid. Finally, the sound propagation is computed by means of a finite element solver. If integral source properties related to the boundary treatment and source truncation technique are satisfied, and the ability of the flow simulation to resolve fine scales according to the numerical scheme and grid resolution is taken into account, good agreement with experimental results could be achieved.

Computational results reveal that acoustic intensity fields do not satisfy the feature of the convective amplification, and the directivity pattern of the acoustic intensity is highly dependent on the source type and the mean flow Mach number. Analytical and numerical results indicate that the acoustic power output from a monopole source is always conservative, but the acoustic power output from a dipole source is nonconservative in a uniform mean flow because there is a conversion between the acoustic energy and the vortical energy. Acoustic power output from uniformly moving sources in a quiescent acoustic medium is compared with that from the corresponding stationary sources in a uniform mean flow. The results indicate that the acoustic power output from the monopole sources is nearly the same, but the acoustic power output from the dipole sources is not equivalent in these two cases, and the deviation becomes significant with the increase in the mean flow Mach number.",56,7

To address this issue, an undeflected Common Research Model is defined through an inverse design procedure that includes the outer mold line geometry of the undeflected wing and the corresponding internal wingbox structure. Additionally, because modern transport aircraft are trending toward higher-aspect-ratio wing designs, a higher-aspect-ratio variant of the Common Research Model wing is developed to assess next-generation wing designs.

28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056870,"This study introduces a scaling law to explain wrinkle dissipation induced on a membrane under a shear load. Wrinkles in an isotropic rectangular membrane are fixed at the bottom edge and subjected to an in-plane shear stress at the upper edge. The wrinkle dissipation is simulated by an in-plane tension load applied at the upper edge, which is perpendicular to the shear load. A scaling law depicts that the ratio of residual wrinkles, which indicates the extent of wrinkle dissipation, is not affected by the membrane size but is uniquely determined by the ratio of the major principal strain to the in-plane shrinkage strain. This observation is verified by performing geometrical nonlinear finite element simulations using shell theory and tension-field theory. Additionally, a simplified equation is derived to directly estimate the ratio of tensile displacement to control membrane wrinkling. This equation reveals that the tensile displacement necessary to completely suppress membrane wrinkling is dependent on the Poisson ratio and the aspect ratio of the membranes. Wrinkles can be perfectly dissipated by applying a tensile displacement equivalent to 64% of the shear displacement when the Poisson ratio is 0.3 and the aspect ratio is larger than 3. The measures used in this study are effective descriptions of membrane wrinkling that can be used to design future spacefaring gossamer structures.",56,7

To this purpose, the concept of a margin space is introduced. It is bidirectionally linked to the design space to enable the designer to understand how assigning margins on certain parameters limits the allowable margins that can be assigned to other parameters. Also, a novel framework is developed. It incorporates the margin space concept as well as enablers, including interactive visualization techniques, which can aid the designer in exploring the margin and design spaces dynamically, as well as the effects of margins on the probability of constraint satisfaction and on performance. The framework was implemented into a prototype software tool, AirCADia, which was used for a qualitative evaluation by practicing designers. The evaluation, conducted as part of the European Union’s Thermal Overall Integrated Conception of Aircraft project, demonstrates the usefulness of the approach.",56,7
