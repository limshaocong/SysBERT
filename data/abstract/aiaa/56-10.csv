1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057417,"The paper numerically and experimentally examines a method to reduce combustion length within a Mach 12, shape-transitioning scramjet. As the examined airframe-integrated engine transitions from a rectangular inlet to an elliptical throat, highly three-dimensional flow is delivered to the combustor. Tailored to this nonuniform flowfield, hydrogen fuel is injected at both inlet- and combustor-based stations. The current work shortens the engine combustor and removes a legacy rear-facing step. Computational fluid dynamics guides the length by which the combustor may be reduced while still ensuring sufficient combustion. Experimental validation under shock-tunnel conditions follows. Static pressure and heat transfer measurements throughout the flowpath examined combustion at on-design conditions. Comparisons are made to unfueled and suppressed combustion cases, and efficient combustion is attained with combined inlet- and combustor-based fueling within a combustor reduced in length by 68%. Inlet-only fueling displays similar ignition characteristics to the combined-fueling cases, whereas combustor-only fueling displays marginal pressure and heat transfer increases from suppressed-combustion cases. Measured pressure on the engine nozzle displays greater increases under combined fueling than that which would be obtained through the direct summation of the constituent inlet-only and combustor-only fueled cases, indicating inlet-injected fuel pilots combustion of combustor-injected fuel.",56,10

The development of circulation control and fluidic thrust vectoring concepts and the contributions of numerous researchers to the current understanding of supersonic wall jets are reviewed and placed into context with the authors’ own research. The value of supplementing fundamental experimental and numerical research with more practical system integration studies and small-scale flying demonstration activities is shown to be a valuable approach to providing focus and direction for the research. Simple technology demonstrators have also proved to be valuable motivators for the research team and provided important focus in promoting the technologies and ideas to the wider stakeholder community. Outcomes of the research are now being explored in the context of taking them to the next stage of practical maturity.",56,10
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056884,"This paper describes a heuristic approach to feedback flow control and illustrates its use for two flowfields: the flow around a tangent ogive at large angles of attack and the shear layer behind a backward-facing step. Both investigations followed the feedback flow control approach laid out in this paper; however, because of the very different flowfields and control goals, different techniques were selected for developing the most effective control strategy. The flow instabilities on the tangent ogive made this flow a good candidate for effective flow control. Unforced computational and experimental data showed the relevant flow features. With only four pressure sensors, the relevant flow features were controlled, and a prescribed side force signal could be tracked. For the shear layer, the control goal was to reduce the optical path difference, a control goal that cannot easily be observed in experiment or simulation. Using a wavenet autoregressive exogenous model, a reduction in optical path difference of 40% was achieved using a sensor array colocated with the aperture. Open-loop simulations showed the need to capture the effect of forcing startup and shutdown. Adaptive feedback resulted in a new flow state that the open-loop data had not captured.",56,10
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056949,A 50 year journey through flow control strategies that seek to achieve viscous drag reduction in turbulent boundary layers is presented. These are shown to focus on different mechanisms underlying coherent motions that have been observed in the early period of turbulent boundary-layer research. The approaches have generally focused either on modifying the large-scale outer motions or the small-scale motions near the wall that are particularly associated with low-speed wall streaks. The degree of success of these approaches is highlighted.,56,10
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057094,"Pulsed blowing is applied to prevent turbulent flow separation on the trailing-edge flap of a two-element high-lift wing configuration that is based on a state-of-the-art transonic profile shape. While ensuring experimental conditions relevant to application on aircraft level, the flow field along the suction side of the flap is investigated by means of time-resolved particle image velocimetry. The obtained velocity fields are investigated by employing the recently introduced method of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition, allowing for an identification of coherent flow structures in the Eulerian specification that can be robustly related to specific frequencies. It is shown that the spectral content of the observed modes can be employed as an indicator for the flow control authority. The approach is supported by the computation of finite-time Lyapunov exponent fields containing ridges that indicate Lagrangian coherence. In the context of this study, they correspond to separation profiles, and thus allow for further assessment of the actuation effectivity. The baseline configuration is shown to be characterized by two distinct material lines connecting downstream of the trailing-edge flap and enclosing a recirculation zone of significant size. In the case of actuation with the lower studied momentum input, the recirculation zone is intermittently suppressed, whereas the greater actuation intensity is sufficient to ensure a stable prevention of turbulent flow separation.",56,10
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057030,"A low-order model for the circulation budget within a leading-edge vortex (LEV) is proposed, based on one-dimensional species advection. The model is composed of two parts: first, a shear-layer model predicts the circulation feeding rate into the LEV; and second, a spanwise transport model initializes vorticity-containing mass with a finite circulation, allowing circulation to advect along the span with spanwise flow. No empirical data are necessary to inform the results of the model. As a proof of concept, both components of the proposed model are evaluated against a flat-plate delta wing. Using particle image velocimetry, the proposed shear-layer model is found to predict circulation flux into the LEV. Particle-tracking velocimetry is used to validate the spanwise transport of circulation. By allowing a vorticity-containing mass to advect with the spanwise flow, the model automatically satisfies the vorticity transport equation when vortex tilting and viscous diffusion are neglected. Neglecting the vortex tilting and viscous diffusion terms results in an error of approximately 10% of the spanwise advection, such that these terms are within the acceptable tolerance of a low-cost model. Thus, the proposed model is a computationally inexpensive tool for predicting circulation redistribution in flows with specific three-dimensional effects, providing a framework for broader parameter studies going forward.",56,10

The gust is supplied upstream of the airfoil as a Taylor vortex. Three different initial vertical positions are considered for a clockwise (CW)-oriented gust. ILES simulation of CW gust interactions is compared with inviscid simulations as well as prior counterclockwise (CCW) gust simulations. Contrary to the previous CCW gust interactions, the upper surface boundary-layer experiences an upstream excursion of laminar separation, transition, and turbulent reattachment that lingers behind the gust. This upstream shift manifests in a pitch-up moment coefficient that relaxes slowly to the pregust state. As in the previous CCW cases, the lower surface boundary layer is disrupted by the CW vortex producing a brief acoustic event. This effect is particularly severe when the CW gust passes just beneath the wing section. In this scenario, the lower surface instability coalesces into a boundary-layer vortex and briefly forms a dipole with the CW gust.",56,10
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057114,"The luminescent oil film flow tagging skin friction meter is presented and used to collect time-averaged spatially distributed skin friction data on the surface of NASA’s FAITH model. The technique estimates skin friction by monitoring the evolution of a luminescent oil film evolving under the influence of skin friction, pressure gradients, and gravity. The thickness distribution of the oil film, , and the velocity of the surface of the oil film, , are measured experimentally, and the dynamic viscosity of the oil, , is taken from the oil manufacturer or is determined through calibration. Then, skin friction is estimated as . The thickness distribution of the oil film is measured by ratioing the intensity of the luminescent signal from the fluorescent oil with the intensity of the incident light that is scattered from the surface of the model. The resulting quotient is independent of the intensity of the incident light and directly proportional to the thickness of the oil film. The velocity of the surface of the oil film is measured by tagging and following photochromic molecules in the oil film. The new luminescent oil film flow tagging skin friction data compare well with fringe image skin friction data. Also, an experimental study is conducted to determine the extent to which it is appropriate to neglect the effects of a pressure gradients and gravity when determining skin friction from the evolution of an oil film. Results are presented supporting that this approximation is appropriate for a sufficiently thin film of oil or for a sufficiently high skin friction magnitude.",56,10
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057216,"Skin-friction and surface-pressure in a viscous flow constitute a pair of the intrinsically coupled physical quantities denoted by the notation (, ), which determines the near-wall flow structures. The exact (, ) relation derived from the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations provides a rational foundation for reconstruction of the (, ) structures in complex flows. Based on this coupling relation, a field can be obtained from the perturbed field for the given boundary enstrophy flux field of a base flow as an inverse problem in the first-order approximation. Then, the corresponding near-wall velocity field is reconstructed by using the Taylor-series-expansion solution of the NS equations. Some elemental and complex (, ) structures in three-dimensional flow separations are reconstructed to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.",56,10
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056168,"Pressure-related turbulence statistics in a two-dimensional open cavity shear layer flow was investigated experimentally at a Reynolds number of based on a cavity length of 38.1 mm. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry sampled at 4500 frames per second and field of view was used to simultaneously measure the instantaneous velocity and pressure distributions. Direct estimate results of the pressure–rate-of-strain, pressure diffusion, and velocity–pressure-gradient tensor components based on 140,000 measurement samples were presented after a brief review of the theory about the pressure-related terms in the context of turbulence modeling and a discussion about their role in determining an accurate mean flow. The analysis is also augmented with comparisons with experimental data obtained at a higher Reynolds number of . The pressure and streamwise velocity correlation changes its sign from negative values far upstream in the shear layer to positive ones near the trailing corner due to the strong adverse pressure gradient imposed by the corner. The distribution patterns of the pressure diffusion and the turbulence diffusion are considerably different, indicating that the conventional practice of modeling the transport terms all together as Laplacians of the turbulent kinetic energy is not justifiable, at least for the turbulent shear layer flow past a cavity. In the shear layer, turbulence fluctuation energy is redistributed from streamwise to lateral components. This intercomponent energy transfer is reversed on top of the trailing corner, indicating the complexity of the flow, especially around the corner area.",56,10
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057276,"Acoustic analogy approaches can be used to express the sound radiation from a turbulent flow as the convolution product of a propagator and a source term. This paper presents an acoustic analogy-based analysis that properly accounts for circumferential variations of the propagator across the source correlation region in an axisymmetric jet. The analysis shows that including azimuthal source noncompactness effects leads to a formula for the acoustic spectrum in which each circumferential propagator mode couples only to its corresponding Fourier mode of the source term. This significantly affects the radiated sound field, because the lower-order propagator modes radiate much more efficiently than the higher-order modes, while the lower-order source modes usually contain significantly less energy than the higher-order modes. The resulting formula depends on the Reynolds stress autocovariance tensor, which must be accurately modeled in order to obtain realistic predictions of the sound field. A relatively simple, experimentally based model of this tensor is proposed and combined with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions to obtain predictions of the noise from a moderately supersonic cold round jet. The predictions are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data and the analysis is used to provide insights into the modal structures of the source and sound fields.",56,10

Measurements encompass static wall pressure of the internal flow, shadowgraphy images of the exhaust plume, and far-field acoustics for a range of pressure ratios. An experimentally validated Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model of the internal flow is then used to reveal how the aft deck and sidewalls allow the expanding gas to persist longer, thereby extending the location of the separation shock. Where the far-field sound is concerned, the aft deck and sidewall attachments cause a noticeable reduction in overall sound pressure levels by as much as 5 dB at shallow angles and sideline observer positions. Many of the tones associated with screech and broadband shock associated noise are also absent with the addition of the aft deck and sidewalls.",56,10
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056855,"The dominant fluid structures and unsteady behavior of the three-dimensional transonic buffet phenomenon on a swept wing are clarified. This paper focuses on a well-established buffet phenomenon rather than an incipient shock buffet (buffet onset). Zonal detached-eddy simulation reproduced the features of three-dimensional buffet. Three-dimensional fluid structures were extracted as modes with dynamic mode decomposition. To apply dynamic mode decomposition to the large fluid dataset, the dimensionality was reduced using incremental proper orthogonal decomposition bases. Then, dominant modes were identified using the compressed sensing approach. The results showed that the computed flowfield is dominated by two fluid structures. One is a buffet cell structure oscillating at Strouhal numbers 0.2 to 0.6. The buffet cells are spatially periodic in the spanwise direction. They are generated at midspan, where a large flow separation occurs, and they propagate at an angle toward the wing tip. The other main fluid structure has a frequency and represents the disturbances generated by the separation at midspan and propagating toward the wing tip and root. The two-dimensional shock wave at the root is oscillated by this disturbance.",56,10
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056236,"This paper describes a novel hypersonic facility to reproduce the high stagnation pressures and temperatures necessary for the accurate simulation of hypersonic flows in the range Mach 5–7, while providing test times sufficiently long to study unsteady flow effects. The facility uses a preheated Ludwieg tube together with a piston-compression stage to generate reservoir temperatures difficult to achieve with electrical heating alone, but also avoiding the introduction of vitiation contaminants. The absence of shocks in the generating flow is expected to lead to increased flow quality while also providing longer test times compared with shock-driven facilities of comparable size. The operational concept is described and a condition for optimal operation is defined based on minimizing the dimensions of the heated section for a given set of desired flow conditions. A simple theoretical treatment shows that this condition constrains the ratio of the nozzle exit and Ludwieg tube diameters, assuming accurate simulation of flight conditions. A method-of-characteristics solver is used to determine the constrained facility parameters more accurately. Modeling of the unsteady adiabatic compression cycle is performed with quasi-one-dimensional finite volume computations, and various configurations are explored to minimize the pressure oscillations generated during compression.",56,10
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056500,"An experimental study is conducted on the interaction of a swept shock wave with a turbulent boundary layer. The shock wave is generated by a sharp unswept fin in a Mach 2 flow, where the strength of the interaction is varied from weak to moderate by changing the angle of attack of the fin from 10 to 15 deg, which corresponds to a normal Mach number of 1.3 and 1.4, respectively. Surface oil-flow visualization is used to study the topography of the interaction where surface flow features such as the upstream influence line and the separation lines are identified. By taking advantage of the quasi-conical symmetry of the flowfield, velocity field measurements are acquired in the conical reference frame for the interaction at the moderate interaction strength of at two locations from the fin apex. Flowfield features such as the -shock structure, slip line, and the separation bubble with the reverse flow are clearly visible in the velocity field. These results are also examined in the spherical coordinate frame, and good agreement in the spatial location of the critical features is found, providing direct quantitative, experimental evidence of quasi-conical symmetry of the flowfield above the surface. An examination of the velocity field downstream of the rear-foot of the -shock shows a region (a “streamtube,” bounded on one side by the slip line emanating from the triple point) where the flow accelerates to transonic and supersonic speeds. This flow eventually turns toward and impinges upon the flat plate, a phenomenon referred to as an “impinging jet” in the literature. It is believed to be the principal cause of the high mean, unsteady pressures, very high heating, and skin friction coefficients that the present measurements confirm. An examination of the turbulence kinetic energy reveals a significant increase in amplitude in the separated flow region that is bounded by the flattened vortex under the -shock.",56,10
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056982,"Macroscale computations of shocked particle-laden flows rely on closure laws to model the heat transfer between the fluid and particle phases. Typically, closure models are semiempirical and obtained for a limited range of parameters because experiments can be difficult and expensive to perform. This paper describes an approach to obtain closures for heat and momentum exchanges from ensembles of high-fidelity mesoscale computations of shock–cylinder interactions. The simulations are performed for flow over a single cylinder for a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers . The results are used to construct a metamodel for the drag coefficient and the Nusselt number correlation using a modified Bayesian kriging method. To study the effects of the particle volume fraction , mesoscale computations are performed for cylinder clusters and the and are calculated. The metamodel shows that, although the Nusselt number is primarily a function of the , the and also significantly affect the interphase heat transfer. In particular, the Nusselt number first decreases until and increases for values of . The results show that compressibility and viscous effects must be taken into account to provide accurate closure laws for interphase heat transfer in shocked particle-laden flows.",56,10
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056963,"Numerical simulations are presented that compare the specific impulse of a generic inlet-fueled uniform-compression and nonuniform-compression scramjet over the flight Mach number range of 7–12 with a constant freestream dynamic pressure trajectory of 100 kPa. Both engine configurations have identical inlet contraction ratio, inlet to nozzle area ratio, and combustor and nozzle geometries. The results show that the specific impulse in the nonuniform-compression scramjet is higher than the uniform-compression scramjet at each flight condition. The increase in specific impulse for Mach 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are 165, 178, 96, 74, and 15 s, respectively. Both the uniform- and nonuniform-compression engines unstarted at the Mach 7 condition. In addition, two three-dimensional swept-nozzle configurations (45 and 60 deg) are integrated into the nonuniform-compression engine to investigate an idea of coupling the nonuniform flow with a nonuniform expansion nozzle to improve performance. The 45 deg results show no change in specific impulse at Mach 8–11 and a 50 s improvement at Mach 12. The 60 deg configuration has less specific impulse at each flight condition, except Mach 12. The thermal loads are reduced by 15 and 30% for the 45 and 60 deg configurations at each flight condition. The findings provide new insight into how nonuniform compression with swept nozzles can provide an additional degree of freedom in the design of fixed-geometry scramjets that have robust performance over a range of flight conditions.",56,10
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056548,"Using a multiphase 3D large-eddy simulation approach, simulations were conducted to study the fundamentals of multiphase turbulent mixing in a scramjet combustor. These simulations studied the effects of particle distribution, acceleration history, and particle lag. Heterogeneous, clumped, particle distributions, as produced by fuel injector nozzles, were explored to determine the effect of particle distribution on multiphase mixing in a scramjet engine environment. The heterogeneity of the particle distributions is varied by examining different clump densities and distributions while maintaining a constant particle size distribution and mass ratio. Evaporation rates, particle lag distances, vapor mixing, and enstrophy are reported from these simulations. Overall, new-vapor production rates were found to be low, with vapor mixing being largely driven by the heterogeneity of the particle distribution. The primary finding of this work is that more heterogeneous distributions of particles produce greater mixing of the particle vapor. This enhanced mixing results from particle lag and a greater deposition of enstrophy by gradients in particle mass fraction.",56,10
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056831,"Oblique detonation waves (ODWs) have been widely studied due to their application potential for airbreathing hypersonic propulsion. Moreover, various formation structures of wedge-induced oblique detonation waves have been revealed in recent numerical investigations. Given the inflow conditions, the wave configuration is dependent on the wedge angle. Hence, any wedge-angle change will induce a transient ODW evolution to transition from one configuration to another. In this study, the transient development created by instantaneously changing the wedge angle is investigated numerically, based on the unsteady two-dimensional Euler equations and one-step irreversible Arrhenius chemical kinetics. The evolution caused by the abrupt wedge-angle change from one smooth initiation structure to another, both with a curved oblique shock/detonation surface at high-Mach-number regime, is investigated. Two processes are analyzed; the first consists of the downstream transition of the ODW initiation region the by decreasing the angle, and the second is the upstream transition by increasing the angle. In the downstream transition, the overall structure moves globally and readjusts continuously, generating an intermediate kinklike initiation structure. In the upstream transition, a localized reaction region forms and induces a more complex process, mainly derived from the different responding speeds of the oblique shock and detonation waves. To avoid the generation of the new localized explosion region, which causes an abrupt change in the initiation position and potentially affects the ODWE’s stability and performance, it is suggested to vary the wedge angle in incremental steps within a certain time interval.",56,10
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056632,"An alternative approach to prevent spurious behavior caused by conventional shock-capturing schemes when solving stiff detonation wave problems is introduced. In engineering research of detonation waves, conventional shock-capturing schemes usually encounter difficulties in identifying the location of the detonation front because the discontinuous solution is smeared. To overcome this excessive numerical dissipation with traditional discretized schemes used in nonreacting high-speed compressible flow, a shock-capturing scheme is introduced in which, besides the linear function constructed in the monotone upstream-centered schemes for conservation law (MUSCL) scheme, a steplike tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing (THINC) function is also employed in the reconstruction process. The final reconstruction function is determined using the boundary variation diminishing (BVD) algorithm, which reduces significantly the numerical dissipation around discontinuities. One- and two-dimensional comparative numerical tests of stiff detonation wave problems were conducted with the fifth-order weighted essentially nonoscillatory and MUSCL-THINC-BVD schemes, demonstrating that the latter scheme reproduces the correct position of detonation waves with improved resolution, whereas the former scheme, despite the higher order, produces spurious waves. Compared with other methods, which, by accepting smeared-out discontinuities profiles, require extra treatments, the current method obtains the correct but also sharp detonation front by fundamentally reducing numerical dissipation errors in shock-capturing schemes.",56,10

It has been widely used as a physical power source for microminiature flying objects. However, the rotational speed of the microturbine generator may exceed its rated speed when it moves at high speeds.

In optimization, corrected low-fidelity data are typically used in a sequence of independent, approximate optimizations bounded by trust regions. A new, unified, multifidelity quasi-Newton approach is presented that preserves an approximate inverse Hessian between iterations, determines search directions from high-fidelity data, and uses low-fidelity models for line searches. The proposed algorithm produces better search directions, maintains larger step sizes, and requires significantly fewer low-fidelity function evaluations than Trust Region Model Management. The multifidelity quasi-Newton method also provides an expected optimal point that is forward looking and is useful in building superior low-fidelity corrections. The new approach is compared with Trust Region Model Management and the BFGS quasi-Newton method on several analytic test problems using polynomial and kriging corrections. For comparison, a technique is demonstrated to initialize high-fidelity optimization when transition away from approximate models is deemed fruitful. In summary, the unified multifidelity quasi-Newton approach required fewer or equal high-fidelity function evaluations than Trust Region Model Management in about two-thirds of the test cases, and similarly reduced cost in more than half of cases compared with BFGS.",56,10
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056812,"This paper presents a methodology that enables projection-based model reduction for black-box high-fidelity models governing nonlinear static parametric systems. The methodology specifically addresses the situation in which the high-fidelity model may be a black box, but there is knowledge of the governing equations in continuous partial differential equation (PDE) form. Drawing from the Koopman theory, it first obtains an underdetermined linear representation of the governing equations in terms of a set of observables. Then, the linear operator is extracted by a direct discretization of the linear differential terms using a suitable method, such as the finite volume method. By applying the snapshots of the observables to the discrete linear operator, a right-hand-side vector is obtained, providing the necessary system matrices for the projection step, which is done via proper orthogonal decomposition. The underdetermined linear system is closed with a set of nonlinear algebraic equations that act as constraints, whose computation is efficiently handled via the discrete empirical interpolation method. An offline database of reduced-order models (ROMs) corresponding to each parameter snapshot is generated, which are then interpolated online to predict the state for new parameter instances. The resulting ROM is posed and solved as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The method is tested on a canonical PDE, followed by the 2-D compressible Euler equations governing the flow past an airfoil, under both the subsonic and transonic regimes. It is demonstrated that the ROM predicts both the state and outputs within 5% of the full-order model given adequate snapshots and the computational speedup is up to two to three orders of magnitude.",56,10

However, obtaining sensitivities by traditional finite difference schemes of full blisk finite element models fails to meet the efficiency requirement. An approach is presented here that meets both the accuracy and efficiency requirements for calculating modal sensitivities by formulating a modal expansion method for blisk models. This approach accommodates repeated eigenvalues common to blisks, where traditional approaches result in singular equations when solving for sensitivities.

A Taylor series expansion is adopted to obtain the explicit expression of gravitational potential energy. Also, a simplified model of the gravitational force is proposed to improve simulation efficiency. Finally, two case studies are presented to validate the proposed modeling method, including a two-dimensional Euler–Bernoulli beam in elliptic orbits and a thin plate in a circular orbit. The effects of orbital eccentricity on the orbital and attitude accuracies of the proposed method, the mutual effects between the attitude motion and structural vibrations, and the effects of the flexibility on the attitude controller of the beam are also investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed modeling method takes gravitational force as well as gravity gradient torque into account accurately. The simplified model is recommended because of its accuracy and time efficiency.",56,10
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057115,"This paper focuses on the free vibration analysis of axially inhomogeneous and nonuniform beams considering the Bresse-Timoshenko slope-inertia model (BTSIM) as the governing equation. The BTSIM governing equation is obtained by modifying the rotational term in the kinetic energy expression. To solve the BTSIM equation analytically, it is reduced to an uncoupled second-order differential equation of Sturm-Liouville type with respect to rotation angle due to bending. This simplified equation is then solved to obtain closed-form solutions for some allowable variation of properties along the beam axis. Natural frequencies are then calculated for different material and geometric nonuniformities along the beam axis, and for various boundary conditions. A comparison between the results obtained for the reduced equation and the finite element method is carried out. The original and BTSIM model results are also compared with an available experimental result. The effect of changing the kinetic energy expression is shown by comparing the natural frequencies obtained from the original and BTSIM model for various boundary conditions.",56,10
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057091,"Elastic foundation models are often used in fracture mechanics applied to face/core debonds in sandwich composites or in face wrinkling studies. The elastic constants to be used in these models are the most important element in these formulations. This paper presents closed-form solutions for the determination of these constants based on 1) the extended high-order sandwich panel theory and 2) the elasticity theory. The extended high-order sandwich panel theory results in a system of seven algebraic equations, which can be directly solved for the seven real constants that enter into the formulas (all calculations are in real variables). The elasticity solution results in a system of 12 linear algebraic equations, which can be directly solved for the twelve complex constants that enter into the formulas, and it also involves the direct solution of three characteristic equations (for the 2 faces and the core). In the elasticity approach, the calculations are done in complex variables. Direct formulas are derived for both the normal and the shear spring constants. The definition of the elastic foundation constants and possible misconceptions surrounding them are discussed. New simple formulas are also suggested, which are variations of “crude” formulas existing in the literature.",56,10
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056856,"The concept of a curvilinearly stiffened panel is promising for aerospace and aircraft structures with cutouts, since the stiffness distribution and loading path can be flexibly tailored in terms of cutouts. However, uncertainties from the manufacturing process can significantly reduce the practical load-carrying capacity of a curvilinearly stiffened panel. Traditional nondeterministic design optimization methods would suffer from a high computational burden because numerous discrete-continuous variables, in which thousands of finite element analyses are usually required, are involved. Therefore, a hierarchical nondeterministic optimization framework of a curvilinearly stiffened panel is established, containing two steps (global search and local search) and four main parts (layout design, nondeterministic design optimization, reshape layout design, and stress validation). In the first-step deterministic optimization, all variables are considered, and a rough result set will be obtained by a global search. In the second-step nondeterministic optimization, all discrete-continuous layout parameters are fixed in the initial stage, and the efficient adaptive-loop method is applied to significantly increase the computational efficiency, in which the variations of material properties and geometric dimensions are considered as uncertainties. The layout also will be reshaped to explore the potential of the load-carrying capacity. Finally, the stress constraint and crippling constraint are verified for the optimum design. An illustrative example indicates the advantage of the proposed framework not merely provides a competitive efficiency and robustness over other nondeterministic approaches but also improves the rationality of deterministic design optimization.",56,10
