Variations in the Reynolds number , pitch amplitude , and thickness ratio consistently show that the scaling for thrust, power, and efficiency derived in a recent study of heaving and pitching teardrop airfoils applies unchanged for the present case. The empirically determined coefficients in these scaling relationships are found to depend on the square root of Reynolds number, suggesting laminar flow scaling. The thrust and power are relatively insensitive to Reynolds numbers greater than about 16,000, but the efficiency continues to show a significant Reynolds number influence because it is strongly influenced by the drag on the airfoil.",57,7
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058196,"In this study, a traditional dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator and plasma streamwise vortex generators (PSVGs) are installed on a bluff body to control the wake fluctuations. Experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel with a chord Reynolds number of 5000. Particle image velocimetry and hot-wire measurements are used to obtain the details of the flowfields. The results show that both DBD and PSVG actuations clearly reduce the size of the recirculation bubble regions, and they significantly suppress the wake fluctuations. A comparison of the traditional DBD and PSVG cases shows that PSVGs have better control performance on the reduction of the recirculation bubble sizes and the Karman vortex shedding frequency in the wake at low speed. Specifically, the PSVGs have a strong three-dimensional effect on the entire flowfield and generate streamwise vorticities that interact with the shear flow over the bluff body. The local flow separations are thereby suppressed considerably. The induced streamwise vorticities are further entrained downstream by the ambient freestream, which consequently reduces the recirculation bubble behind the bluff body and suppresses the wake fluctuations. These results suggest that PSVGs are promising devices for conducting flow control in bluff body wakes at low speed.",57,7
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058324,"A recently proposed high-frequency control concept for dynamic-stall mitigation is demonstrated using large-eddy simulation of a pitching NACA 0012 airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of . At this condition, dynamic stall occurs when the suction-surface laminar separation bubble (LSB) breaks down due to interaction with the turbulent separation as it propagates upstream. It is shown that when high-frequency forcing is introduced near the leading edge, targeting the most amplified frequency of the LSB, the LSB amplifies the disturbances, resulting in a more energetic turbulent boundary layer. For a ramp-type pitching motion this control approach impedes the upstream progression of the turbulent separation and reduces the severity of the leading-edge breakdown process when dynamic stall eventually occurs. Control is then demonstrated on a sinusoidal pitching motion where interaction between the turbulent separation and the LSB is avoided. Large reductions in drag and moment excursions are noted, and it is surmised that, for higher reduced frequency or lower maximum , the effects of dynamic stall would be completely eliminated.",57,7
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057502,"The traditional linear stability analysis for transition prediction includes the following steps: solving velocity profiles using boundary-layer equations or a computational fluid dynamics solver, guessing and searching operations for the eigenvalues, computing the linear perturbation equations, and integrating the amplification factor . It is difficult to implement into modern computational fluid dynamics solvers with parallel computations because it requires many nonlocal variables and coordinate system transformations. In this Paper, an amplification factor transport equation, which can be coupled with a modern computational fluid dynamics parallel solver, is established based on the analysis results through linear stability theory for stationary crossflow instabilities. According to the analysis results of Falkner–Skan–Cooke similarity velocity profiles using linear stability theory analysis, the source term of the present transport equation is formulated locally to describe the growth of stationary crossflow waves in the laminar boundary layer. This new equation is added to the equation proposed by Coder and Maughmer for Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities. Finally, coupling of these two amplification factor transport equations and Menter’s shear stress transport turbulence model completes an effective transition turbulence model. Comparisons between the present predictions, wind tunnel experiments and the standard linear stability theory analysis on an NLF(2)-0415 infinite swept wing, Petzold’s sickle-shaped wing and 6:1 inclined prolate spheroid validate the reasonable establishment of the present amplification factor transport equation for stationary crossflow instabilities.",57,7

In the paper, a canonical wingtip vortex generated by a NACA0015 rectangular wing was experimentally investigated using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry and linear stability analysis in times/pace at the azimuthal wavenumber of to quantitatively determine its instability features, as well as to analyze the vortex wandering development. Statistical analysis of the vortex core locations indicated that the vortex wandering amplitudes stayed in the range of within the measured conditions and wake region, where was the chord length of the rectangular wing. Moreover, the wandering amplitude was amplified along the streamwise location, indicating that the instability of wingtip vortex was gradually enhanced. To quantitatively determine the instability features, the linear stability analysis approach was performed based on the azimuthally averaged fitted profiles in the re-centered flow field. The two continuous branches and a single eigenvalue (corresponding to the primary mode of wingtip vortex) were found in the frequency/spatial spectrum and all distribute in the negative complex plane, demonstrating that wingtip vortex in our experiments is neutrally stable. In addition, the nondimensional frequency and wavenumbers of the primary mode were nearly identical and stayed within , corresponding to a Strouhal number of under different flow configurations. The distributions of vorticity perturbation from the primary mode are identical at different streamwise locations and rotate with the phase of the primary mode periodically, explaining the nearly isotropic features of vortex wandering. The tendencies of temporal/spatial growth rates of the disturbance under different Reynolds numbers and angles of attack, as well as along streamwise locations, share the same trends with that of the wandering amplitude, implying that the vortex wandering development should depend on the instability development.",57,7

In detail, a large-eddy simulation has been conducted and then validated through quantitative comparisons with previous experimental and numerical investigations. Based on the numerical results, a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis has been carried out. The flow control mechanisms within stall regime and physical backgrounds of corresponding POD modes have been uncovered from the view of flow energy. It has been found that the improved aerodynamic characteristics of modified airfoil might be attributed to different flow mechanisms at peaks and troughs, including spanwise momentum transfer process and flow transition within laminar separation bubble. In addition, the fluctuating characteristics of airfoil flow field have also been investigated. Consequently, it has been found that the Karman vortices dominate the rear wake of the smooth airfoil and the first four POD modes are closely related with the shedding process. In contrast, the corresponding vortex shedding process is suppressed by the modified airfoil according to the results of POD analysis.",57,7

A NACA 0012 airfoil was used for all wing models, which were subject to a sinusoidal pitch oscillation between 4 and 22 deg at a reduced frequency of 0.1 and a Reynolds number of . After acquiring the experimental performance data, it was found that decreasing the leads to a decrease in the nonlinear unsteady loading of the wing and postpones the dynamic stall process, which also leads to variations in the pitch damping characteristics. Velocity field measurements revealed that the dynamic stall vortex originates from flow separation at the leading edge across the wing inboard section and convects downstream across the chord, whereas the unsteady separation progresses toward the wing tips with increasing angle of attack. The formation of this vortex was delayed to higher angles of attack with reductions in , and the three-dimensional nature of the unsteady separation process led to a significant spanwise flow component identified in the acquired velocity fields.",57,7
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057711,"A wide range of model calibration methods and formulas have been introduced in the literature for calibrating low-fidelity (LF) computer models against high-fidelity (HF) computer models or data. Although most existing model calibration techniques assume that LF and HF models have identical inputs, in some engineering applications, for example, wing aerodynamics computations, inputs to LF and HF models are often defined differently due to different levels of abstraction in modeling or simulation. For these problems, this paper proposes a new model calibration method that calibrates a mapping from HF model inputs to LF inputs by matching HF and LF model outputs. The method incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting and to allow calibration parameter selection. In the application to calibrating aerodynamic simulation models, three advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated. First, it achieves higher calibration accuracy than the traditional bias correction method when HF data are scarce. Second, it provides convenient and effective calibration parameter selection in the calibration process. Finally, it enables physical insights to be drawn from the calibrated input mapping. Specifically, for the test cases examined, the calibration adjusts wing twist angles to compensate for the neglect of thickness in the vortex lattice representation of the wing geometry.",57,7

The resulting exergetic drag curves are proposed as additional characteristic curves for external aerodynamic assessment of airfoils or any other bodies. Moreover, a new far-field wave anergy extraction method suitable for wind tunnel applications is presented. Computational fluid dynamics analyses of a NACA 0012 airfoil and a rectangular wing at subsonic and transonic conditions were used as test cases to present the concept. This new approach brings a deeper understanding of the aerodynamic behavior of a body and provides an alternative point of view to the classical near-field-based and far-field-based drag curves.",57,7
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057955,"The present work focuses on shape optimization using the lattice Boltzmann method applied to aerodynamic cases. The adjoint method is used to calculate the sensitivities of the drag force with respect to the shape of an object. The main advantage of the adjoint method is its cost, because it is independent from the number of optimization parameters. The approach used consists in developing a continuous adjoint of the primal problem discretized in space, time, and velocities. An adjoint lattice Boltzmann equation is thus found, which is solved using the same algorithms as in the primal problem. The test cases investigate new features compared to what exists in the literature, such as the derivation of the grid refinement models in the primal problem to obtain their adjoint counterparts, but also the derivation of a double-relaxation-time algorithm and the Ginzburg et al. interpolation at the wall (“Two-Relaxation-Time Lattice Boltzmann Scheme: About Parametrization, Velocity, Pressure and Mixed Boundary Conditions,” Communications in Computational Physics, Vol. 3, No. 2, 2008, pp. 427–478). Regarding the unsteadiness of the primal problem, two methods differing in accuracy and computational effort are compared using a two-dimensional unsteady case. Finally, this first-of-a-kind adjoint solver is applied to a large-scale three-dimensional turbulent case (the flow of air around a car at a speed of 130 km/h), which shows its usefulness in the industry.",57,7
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057998,"Effects of uniform blowing on a Clark-Y airfoil are investigated experimentally aiming at turbulent friction drag reduction. The uniform blowing is applied on the rear part of the upper surface. The experiment is carried out at the free-stream velocity of , and the Reynolds number based on the chord length is . The angle of attack is set to and 6°. In the velocity measurement by a hot-wire anemometry, the velocity profile in the blowing region is found to shift away from the wall. This behavior is consistent with that observed in the previous studies on a flat plate, and it qualitatively suggests that the local friction drag is reduced by uniform blowing. Subsequently, this study attempts a quantitative assessment of the local friction drag reduction rates by fitting the mean velocity profile to the log-law taking into account the pressure gradient and the blowing effect. From this, this study has confirmed about 20–40% local friction drag reduction due to blowing. Unfortunately, however, the total drag estimated from the wake pressure profile is found to increase slightly by blowing.",57,7
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058135,"The present work discusses an experimental investigation into the effect of orifice geometry on the formation and advection of vortical structures associated with a synthetic jet issued into a quiescent flow. Three orifice geometries (namely, rectangular, trapezoidal, and triangular shapes) having the same aspect ratio and area were tested at a hydraulic diameter-based Reynolds number and a Strouhal number of 7000 and 0.066, respectively. Using a single hot wire, the spanwise distribution of the velocity at the jet orifice plane was first measured. The trapezoidal and triangular orifices exhibited a nonuniform velocity distribution along the orifice, where the velocity was 25 and 130% higher at the smaller cross-section side as compared to the large section side, respectively. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry was employed to investigate the velocity and vorticity fields downstream of the synthetic jet’s orifice. Vortical, ringlike structures were created at each orifice, where the trapezoidal and triangular orifice geometries resulted in vectoring of these structures toward the larger cross-sectional area of the shape. Axis switching was also observed by each orifice; however, it occurred closer to the orifice for the triangular and trapezoidal orifices when compared to the rectangular orifice. Jet spreading and vorticity dissipation are also presented and were shown to be highly dependent on the orifice geometry.",57,7

Three specific scenarios were investigated: a favorable pressure gradient, an adverse pressure gradient, and a separated flow in which the synthetic jet actuators reattached the flow. Multiple coherent vortical structures were shed during the reattachment process, for which the circulation associated with these structures was composed of the “trapped” vorticity within the separated shear layer. The shedding of this vorticity was shown to be an inherent part of the reattachment mechanism. In a smaller, local measurement domain, volumetric flowfields were reconstructed near the synthetic jet orifice. It was shown that the presence of an adverse pressure gradient resulted in an increase of momentum diffusion through the boundary layer, in addition to the rate at which the jet’s axis switching occurred. At the highest angle of attack tested, where the flow was reattached through actuation, the coherent structures associated with the synthetic jet dissipated significantly quicker spatially, as much of the energy associated with the actuation was used to maintain attached flow.",57,7

Time-averaged airloads were measured for varying cylinder–airfoil streamwise distances, (based on cylinder diameter ), along with time- and phase-averaged particle image velocimetry. Changes in the cylinder wake flow structure govern airfoil performance in the cylinder–airfoil interaction. For , the cylinder wake arrangement is a pair of counterrotating vortices in a side-by-side configuration that induce negative drag on the airfoil. As the cylinder–airfoil distance increases to , the cylinder wake arrangement becomes a von Kármán vortex street that induces an oscillating flow field. A leading edge vortex forms over the NACA 0012 as a consequence of the cylinder wake and delays airfoil stall.

The structure and dynamics of interacting jets and wakes, including both large-scale coherent dynamics and turbulent fluctuations, are fundamentally different from that of a single flowfield. The goal of this work is to understand large-scale intermittent dynamics of turbulent interacting wakes and jets using an improved reduced-order modeling strategy called cluster-based reduced-order modeling (CROM) to capture these dynamics. The dynamics of a three-wake system at two spacings is compared to that of a single-wake flowfield using the cluster-based method. The CROM is able to capture the expected dynamics of the single wake and the results are analogous to those from proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). However, CROM reveals a much more complicated set of dynamics in the interacting wake cases, including the existence of two sets of dynamics that intermittently appear and the switching points between them, which the POD was unable to detect. CROM is used to quantify these dynamics and understand the effect of bluff-body spacing on the three-wake flowfields.",57,7

The heating at the wall was sufficiently mild that the temperature and density fields acted as passive scalars with a Prandtl number of 0.71. Simultaneous particle image velocimetry and Malley probe laser deflection measurements were performed in overlapping regions of the boundary layer to identify correlations between coherent velocity structures, passive scalar transport, and optical beam deflection. Streamwise gradients in the streamwise and wall-normal velocity fields were observed to be correlated to the deflection of the optical beam and to streamwise density gradients. The passage of a large-scale motion through the beam path was shown to affect the statistics of the optical beam deflection as well as the local distribution of small-scale velocity features. The wall-normal small-scale velocity features were consistently correlated to the beam deflection, throughout different phases of the large-scale motion convection. The observations motivated a hypothesis that views the large scales as heat carriers, whereas the small scales modify the local sense of a velocity and density gradient toward a streamwise gradient that directly affects the optical beam deflection.",57,7
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058150,"Film cooling is a common practice to protect the optical window of high-speed flying vehicles from overheating. However, the optical distortions caused by density fluctuations in the cooling film may deteriorate the quality of the window. The fluctuations are mainly due to the instability of the shear layer formed between the outer flow and the injected cooling-gas film. Therefore, a stability analysis of the shear layer, as well as the corresponding aero-optical analysis, is highly desired before the design of the window. In this paper, a method of assessing the aero-optical effect based on a stability analysis is proposed. Two simplified models are used to highlight the essential mechanisms through which the optical performance is affected by stability characteristics of the shear layer. Three cases with different cooling gases are investigated, namely, the commonly used air, a light gas (that is, helium), and a slightly heavier gas (that is, carbon dioxide). Among the three candidates, helium performs the best under the criterion of optical path difference because the low density of helium is highly beneficial in reducing density fluctuations in the flow, resulting in much better optical performance as compared with the other two gases.",57,7

The computational fluid dynamics simulation is validated, and the full buffet envelope of the RA16SC1 airfoil is mapped. POD and DMD techniques are then applied to compute a set of flow modes and corresponding dynamical data (for the DMD method). A dominant buffet mode is identified at the buffet frequency. The corresponding mode shape represents the interaction between the shock wave and boundary-layer. Higher modes, at multiples of the buffet frequency, show smaller coherent flow structures at the shock travel area. Further higher modes, of mixed frequencies, are associated with flow structures mainly in the boundary-layer area. Only a few modes are required for accurate reconstruction of the buffet flow field. Finally, it is shown that similar modes are present in all buffet angles of attack. The modal approach used in this study enables straightforward extraction of the underlying flow structures and dynamic properties of buffet flows.",57,7

Here, a novel experimental rig is used to investigate the nature and severity of these interactions for a typical high-incidence scenario. Furthermore, the sensitivity to changes in angle of incidence and mass-flow rate is explored, as potentially experienced across off-design operations. The reference flowfield, informed by typical climb conditions, is defined by an incidence of 23 deg and a freestream Mach number . The lower-lip flow is characterized by a rapid acceleration around the leading edge and an shock ahead of the intake diffuser. Overall, this flowfield is found to be relatively benign, with minimal shock-induced separation. Downstream of the interaction, the boundary layer recovers a healthy profile ahead of the nominal fan location. Increasing the incidence by 2 deg, the separation becomes noticeably larger and unsteadiness develops. Detrimental effects are exacerbated at an even higher incidence of 26 deg. Increasing the mass-flow rate over the lip by up to 15% of the initial value has minor effects on performance and is not found to inhibit the boundary-layer profile recovery.",57,7

Testing was performed with Mach 2 airflow using the Research Cell 19 facility at the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory while varying pressure , temperature , gaseous fuel-injection rate [ standard L/min (SLPM)], and power of the electric discharge . Schlieren imaging and pressure sensors were used to study changes to the flowfield and wall pressure distribution over the test section. The Q-DC electric discharge generates a shock wave that impinges on a rear-facing cavity and increases the pressure throughout the cavity up to 5%. A gas was injected upstream of the cavity to represent fuel injection in a scramjet engine. The flowfield changes due to the Q-DC discharge interaction with the fuel-related bow-shock wave, and shifts the shock train upstream. For injection rates of SLPM, the Q-DC discharge shifts the bow-shock reflection forward to impinge the cavity, thus showing a synergistic effect of the Q-DC discharge and the upstream injection. The maximum relative pressure increase during Q-DC operation with injection was .

An array of steady microjets of six different configurations is placed upstream of the interaction. The primary objective was to study the effect of jet-to-jet spacing and the variation in pitch and skew angles in controlling 1) the extent of separation and 2) the amplitude of shock unsteadiness in the intermittent region of separation. The results show that a jet-to-jet spacing of is most effective in controlling the extent of separation and the depth of the corrugations in the separation line despite a significant reduction in the momentum flux ratio compared to the closely spaced jet configurations. Skewing an already 45 deg pitched jet to 135 deg results in a further reduction in the overall extent of separation at all control pressures. Although a significant reduction in the separation-shock unsteadiness was observed for the 90 deg pitched and skewed jets at , the 135 deg skewed (and 45 deg pitched) jets show a further reduction in this value, but at , much lower than the freestream total pressure.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058071,"This paper investigates the starting transients in vacuum ejector and its dependence on various geometric configurations. Various geometric parameters investigated were the ratio of diffuser to primary duct height , diffuser length–to–diffuser height ratio , and secondary chamber height–to–secondary jet thickness ratio . It is seen that the vacuum ejector start-up is associated with a gradual initial vacuum generation stage, which is followed by a rapid vacuum generation. The gradual vacuum generation is found to be caused by the mass supply by the recirculation bubble (existing in the diffuser) to the secondary chamber exit plane. The rapid evacuation happens when the initial recirculation bubble splits up, which results in a rapid reduction of the amount of reverse flow mass reaching the secondary chamber. It is found that with reduction in the ratio and increase in the ratio, the rapid evacuation stage reduces and eventually vanishes. The present investigation shows that both these configuration changes reduce the mass supply by reverse flow to the secondary chamber and this is attributed to the cause of the reduction in rapid evacuation stage. The present study also shows that the nature of vacuum generation does not vary with change in secondary chamber height.",57,7

Using a self-developed high-precision (Roe scheme for convective flux calculation and fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory for reconstruction) delay detached-eddy simulation (DDES) code, a compressor cascade with massive corner separation under a high Mach number is simulated. The primary aim of the simulations is to obtain the dominating fluctuation vortex structures in and out of the blade passage, as well as to analyze the reason for the formation of these structures. The vortex structures are analyzed after verifying the accuracy of the code. An advanced data mining technology (that is, dynamic mode decomposition) was performed to extract the dominating fluctuation flowfield simulated by DDES for the first time. The results prove the credibility of the self-developed code. It is found that the passage vortex and the hairpin vortex are the primary sources of unsteady fluctuations in and out of the passage, respectively. The former is formed by endwall separation, and the position where it is generated is relatively stable; thus, the endwall suction technology is suggested for flow control. The latter is formed by the intermixing of the passage vortex, the trailing-edge shedding vortex, and the concentrated shedding vortex. Owing to the different frequencies of those three kinds of vortices, different hairpin scales are formed. The research results can provide a basis for flow control design.",57,7

Conventionally, dual-mode combustion engines flamehold with physical obstructions, causing prohibitive losses at high speed. Past experiments of an airframe-integrated scramjet engine at Mach 8 showed that dual-mode combustion was initiated and sustained with an unobstructed flowpath by varying the fueling rate. This flowfield is examined numerically to ascertain the fluid dynamic phenomena leading to the separated combustion modes. Two regimes of dual-mode combustion occurred above stoichiometric fueling: a separation-train-dominated flowfield downstream of the injectors and a flowfield dominated by a large separation upstream of the body-side injectors at higher fueling rates. The first mode occurs when two shocks combine and create a separation on the body-side wall that merges with the body-side injector wake separation, causing a train of separations. The second regime is from the upstream movement of combustion with increasing equivalence ratio: when combustion reaches the rear of the body-side injector, the near injector flow structure changes, allowing fuel and combustion to enter a large separation upstream. The performance of the different modes is explored.",57,7

Both the flutter margin method and the damping ratio extrapolation method had high prediction accuracy in flutter boundary prediction. The rate of increase of dynamic pressure did not have any significant effect on the flutter boundary.

29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057628,"Although the traditional transonic aeroelastic numerical analysis in the time domain is accurate, the high computational cost limits its application. Therefore, in this Paper, an efficient aeroelastic numerical solution based on the time-spectral method, called the time-spectral fluid–structure interaction method, is developed. The periodic aerodynamic forces and structure equations are calculated by using the time-spectral method and the double-iteration method, respectively. The novelty of this method is that in the inner iteration the variable with a strong coupling effect is solved by using the gradient method and the remaining variables are then solved by using the least-square method. Moreover, the computational fluid dynamics solver is not required in the inner iteration. By using the double-iteration method, not only does the computational cost decrease, but the stagnation of the convergence, which occurs frequently when using the one-shot method to search for the critical point, can be avoided. The two-dimensional aeroelastic standard test cases are then used to validate this method. Results show that the flutter boundary and the critical characteristics of the limit cycle oscillation can be captured with a few iterations by the time-spectral fluid–structure interaction method, and the results of this method agree well with those of the traditional time-domain method. This method can improved by one to two orders of magnitude in computational efficiency with a good robustness to initial conditions.",57,7
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057755,"Approximation errors due to using reduced-order, instead of full-order, models in the nonlinear flutter problem of variable-stiffness composite laminates (VSCLs) are qualitatively and quantitatively discussed. These VSCLs are made of composite laminates with curvilinear fibers. A third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) and a -version finite element are used to model the laminate and discretize its displacements and rotations. The VSCLs are subjected to a supersonic airflow and the aerodynamic pressure is approximated using the linear piston theory. The equations of motion of the self-excited vibrational system are formed using the principle of virtual work. In this study, static condensation and/or a modal summation method are used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the full-order model. The equations of motion are solved using a method to calculate the amplitudes of limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs), and to study the dynamic responses, stresses, and damage indexes based on a failure criterion. Approximations are calculated for LCO amplitudes of VSCL plates with various boundary conditions, laminate thickness, and initial deflection (geometric imperfection). Viscous damping can have a major importance in this problem, and the approximation errors are discussed when viscous damping is included or excluded from the equations of motion.",57,7
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058128,"This paper focuses on the vibration and damping analysis of three-layered sandwich cylindrical shells with stiff composite face layers and a viscoelastic core. The equations of motion and boundary conditions governing the free vibration are derived by using the Hamilton’s principle. Then, generalized differential quadrature method is used to solve these equations to obtain the natural frequencies and modal loss factors. Results are validated against the ones that already exist in the literature and performed finite element method analyses of current study. In addition, a parametric study is performed for a sandwich shell with carbon fiber–reinforced plastic face layers and a frequency-dependent viscoelastic core. A 10-parameter fractional derivative model is used to represent the viscoelastic behavior of the core layer. The effects of system parameters, that is, layer thicknesses, the orientation angle of the face layers, and the subtended angle on the vibration and damping characteristics of open cylindrical shells, are investigated in detail. The vibration and damping analyzes of sandwich shells with frequency-dependent viscoelastic core are performed for the first time to the best of the authors’ knowledge.",57,7
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057902,"Variable-stiffness laminates have lately drawn attention because they offer potential for additional structural performance improvements. In the optimization studies, laminate stiffness properties can be described efficiently by using lamination parameters, which is a well-established formulation for constant-stiffness laminates. However, ensuring manufacturability in the design of variable-stiffness laminates with lamination parameters is difficult. In this paper, a novel method for the design of variable-stiffness composite panels using lamination parameters is proposed. The method constrains the design space by controlling the magnitude and direction of change for the lamination parameters, and subsequently leads to a smooth change in the fiber angles. The method is used to maximize the fundamental frequencies of several panels as example cases. The solutions are calculated for various panel geometries and boundary conditions using the developed finite element analysis software. After finding optimal lamination parameter distributions, corresponding discrete fiber angles and fiber paths are retrieved, and the minimum radii of curvature are calculated. The results demonstrate that the proposed design method provides manufacturable smooth fiber paths while using the compact stiffness formulation feature of lamination parameters.",57,7
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057855,"This paper presents the first experimental study of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) active vibration suppression by pole placement using the receptance method. The research is based on a purpose-built modular flexible wing equipped with leading- and trailing-edge control surfaces and two displacement sensors for measuring its position. The MIMO controller has the advantage of being designed entirely on frequency response functions, which are measured between the control surface position (control inputs) and the structural displacements (outputs), and include the actuator dynamics. There is no requirement to evaluate or to know the structural , , and matrices or the aerodynamic loads; and the formulation eliminates the need for a state observer. The controller is first implemented numerically and then experimentally on the aeroelastic system. Both frequencies and damping are assigned (together or independently) for the first two vibration modes. The research includes a procedure for assessing the control effort required and demonstrates an effective means of increasing the flutter margin while the effort is minimized.",57,7
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057677,"Composite laminate stiffened panels are often used in aircraft fuselage design because of their favorable properties. To assess the failure load of these thin-walled structures and to exploit their reserves, a reliable simulation capability for their postbuckling behavior is often necessary. To perform a realistic failure analysis and to accurately detect final collapse, material degradation should be considered. Global-local approaches are computationally efficient techniques to perform a progressive failure analysis and to examine localized damaged areas in detail. In this paper, a two-way coupling global-local approach is presented, including a combination of different damage modes, such as matrix cracking, fiber damage, and skin-stringer debonding. An accurate exchange of information concerning the damage state between global and refined local models is performed. From the global to the local model, the displacements are transferred through a submodeling procedure. Afterward, the degraded material properties obtained from the local model analysis are returned to the global model with a special mapping technique that accounts for the different mesh sizes at the two levels. The two-way coupling procedure is applied to the progressive failure analysis of a one-stringer composite panel loaded in compression. Finally, the numerical results of the procedure are compared with experimental results.",57,7
