The transient aeroelastic response of a stiff in-plane rotor system undergoing variable speed operation in forward flight is considered. During crossing of the fundamental lag mode near 2/rev, high transient lag bending moments are observed. The flapping amplitude and duration of the resonance crossing event have a strong influence on the peak lagwise root bending moment. Embedded chordwise fluidlastic dampers are explored as a way to reduce the peak bending moments. Determination of the fluidlastic damper properties is based on the analysis of a two degree-of-freedom blade-damper system. Parametric studies show that tuning port area ratios, loss factors, and device mass can be modified to enhance damper performance, and control the stroke. Results indicate that more than 6% critical lag damping can be provided around the resonance rotor speed, and that approximately 65% peak-to-peak moment reduction can be achieved with those devices. The stroke of the damper is limited to less than 2.5% blade chord length in the worst-case scenarios. Embedded chordwise fluidlastic dampers can successfully control the lagwise transient loads during the lagwise resonance crossing for the variable speed stiff in-plane rotors studied.",51,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051446,"In this paper, a hybrid immersed boundary technique has been developed for simulating turbulent flows past airfoils with moving trailing-edge flaps. Over the main fixed part of the airfoil, the equations are solved using a standard body-fitted finite volume technique, whereas the moving trailing-edge flap is simulated using the immersed boundary method on a curvilinear mesh. An existing in-house-developed flow solver is employed to solve the incompressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations together with the turbulence model. To achieve consistent wall boundary conditions at the immersed boundaries the turbulence model is modified and adapted to the local conditions associated with the immersed boundary method. The obtained results show that the hybrid approach is an efficient and accurate method for solving turbulent flows past airfoils with a trailing-edge flap and that flow control using an adjustable trailing-edge flap is an efficient way to regulate the aerodynamic loading on airfoils.",51,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051528,"Two mechanisms control sound generated by combustion in gas turbines: direct combustion noise in which acoustic waves generated by the flame propagate from the combustion chamber to the outlet through turbine stages, and indirect combustion noise (or entropy noise) in which entropy waves created by unsteady combustion generate noise as they are accelerated through the turbine stages. These mechanisms can be studied in laboratories by sending acoustic and entropy waves through a nozzle as done in the Entropy Wave Generator experiment. Previous studies have addressed the case where the nozzle is choked and have demonstrated that indirect noise was large compared to direct noise, suggesting that indirect noise only could be retained for gas turbine studies. In the present study, subsonic cases are analysed using, first, a full numerical resolution of the unsteady Euler equations; second, an analytical method based on the work of Marble and Candel in the low-frequency limit, and, finally, the one-dimensional linearized Euler equations in the frequency domain. Results show that direct noise cannot be neglected in these situations and will have to be included for real gas turbines where the flow remains mostly subsonic.",51,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051510,"A solver for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in which solid surfaces are represented using an immersed boundary method is presented. Adaptive Cartesian mesh refinement and coarsening are employed both to resolve immersed boundaries and to dynamically resolve important flow features as they are developing. Dynamically evolving immersed boundaries are tracked using Lagrangian marker points that are governed by direct momentum forcing using either simple force laws or explicitly prescribed motion in a framework that permits simulation of both rigid and flexible lifting surfaces. The adaptive Cartesian immersed boundary method capability presented here is well suited for low Reynolds number flows over flexible lifting surfaces as encountered in modern flapping-wing flyers, flow over complex geometries undergoing large-scale deformations, and vortex-dominated flows. The implementation of both the incompressible Navier–Stokes solver and the immersed boundary method solution algorithm are described in detail, and validation studies are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for resolving flow over flexible lifting surfaces. Results for several representative test cases are presented, and favorable comparisons are made with published data and with results obtained using a volume of fluid advection scheme in the same solver framework.",51,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051559,"The results of an experimental investigation of triangular and circular jets of air issuing into still-air surroundings are presented. Two isosceles triangular jets, issuing from sharp-edged orifices with apex angles of 30 and 160 deg, a sharp-edged orifice circular jet, and a contoured nozzle circular jet, were used for the study. The orifices and nozzle had the same exit area. The Reynolds number, based on the equivalent diameter of the triangular orifices (or diameter of the circular orifice or nozzle), was in the jets. An x–array hot-wire probe and a pitot-static tube were used to acquire the data. The results show that the 160 deg triangular jet has a higher mean streamwise centerline velocity decay rate but a lower mass entrainment rate than the 30 deg triangular jet. Also, the preferred mode Strouhal numbers for the 160 and 30 deg triangular jets were found to be 0.96 and 0.53, respectively. The autocorrelation coefficient distribution exhibits long tails in the 160 deg triangular jet, but it is periodic in the 30 deg triangular jet. Contour maps of the mean streamwise velocity, from which a faster development of the 160 deg triangular jet can be deduced, show changes in the shape of the triangular jets.",51,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051496,"Results of experimental and numerical study of gas flow and heat transfer in the region of interference of the impinging oblique shock wave with the near-wall flow on sharp and blunt plates are presented. The study is performed for the freestream Mach numbers from 5 to 10 and Reynolds numbers from to corresponding to the laminar and turbulent undisturbed boundary layers. The plate bluntness, location of the impinging shock, and the shock strength are varied. It is shown that the plate bluntness significantly reduces the heat transfer in the interference region due to the increase of separation-zone size and the reduction of gas density in the high-entropy layer. As the plate bluntness increases the heat transfer decays to a certain threshold value of the bluntness radius. The bluntness effect on the heat transfer increases and the bluntness threshold value decreases with the freestream Mach number.",51,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051583,"A surrogate-based optimization algorithm for transonic airfoil design is presented. The approach replaces the direct optimization of an accurate, but computationally expensive, high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics model by an iterative reoptimization of a physics-based surrogate model. The surrogate model is constructed, during each design iteration, using the low-fidelity model and the data obtained from one high-fidelity model evaluation. The low-fidelity model is based on the same governing fluid flow equations as the high-fidelity one, but uses coarser mesh resolution and relaxed convergence criteria. The shape-preserving response prediction technique is utilized to predict the high-fidelity model response, here, the airfoil pressure distribution. In this prediction process, the shape-preserving response prediction employs the actual changes of the low-fidelity model response due to the design variable adjustments. The shape-preserving response prediction algorithm is embedded into the trust region framework that ensures good convergence properties of the optimization procedure. This method is applied to constrained airfoil lift maximization and drag minimization in two-dimensional inviscid transonic flow. The optimized designs are obtained at lower computational cost than that of two comparators. The robustness and scaling properties of the proposed algorithm are investigated.",51,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051598,"Unsteady and massively separated flows past the rudimentary landing gear are investigated using delayed detached-eddy-simulation and improved delayed detached-eddy-simulation based on shear stress transport model. To eliminate the unfavorable influence of large numerical dissipation, a high order symmetric total variation diminishing scheme with adaptive dissipation approach is implemented. Three sets of grid, including the coarse, medium and locally refined grids are applied. It is observed that the grid density effect is weak on the mean flows, but significant on the instantaneous quantities. Both approaches present acceptable agreements with the available experiments. Due to its wall-modeled large-eddy-simulation mode, improved delayed detached-eddy-simulation can deliver slightly larger secondary separation and smaller horseshoe vortex on the aft wheels, predict the shear layer instability a little more upstream and resolve smaller instantaneous structures. There are strong interactions between vortices and sharp corners of the landing gear struts. Strongly periodical impingement of vortices also occurs from the fore wheel onto the rear one as well as onto the downstream part of the front wheel itself. These flow behaviors cause the high sound pressure level distribution and lead to surface noise.",51,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051633,"In this paper a derivative-enhanced variable-fidelity surrogate model approach is developed based on a cokriging formulation. In this approach the absolute values of a high-fidelity function as well as the trends obtained by low-fidelity function values are utilized to develop an accurate surrogate model. Derivative information of arbitrary fidelity levels can be also utilized to develop a more accurate surrogate model. The efficiencies of the developed approaches are investigated by analytic function-fitting, aerodynamic data modeling and two-dimensional airfoil-drag-minimization problems. In the aerodynamic problems low-fidelity levels are defined by a different physical model or coarser computational mesh. The numerical examples show that the developed surrogate-model approach is shown to be useful for efficient aerodynamic data modeling and accurate uncertainty analysis with low computational cost. An efficient aerodynamic shape optimization is also realized with the variable fidelity Kriging model. Faster reduction of an aerodynamic objective function is achieved by utilizing the derivative-enhanced variable-fidelity-model approach in which low-fidelity information as well as adjoint-derivative information are simultaneously utilized to construct a surrogate model.",51,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051659,"Robust design optimization has gained increasing concern in the engineering design process because it can provide an economical design that is insensitive to variations in the input variables without eliminating their causes. Robustness assessment, which estimates the mean values and standard deviations of the objective function and constraint functions, is an important and inevitable component in robust design optimization. A hybrid dimension-reduction method is proposed for efficient and accurate robustness assessment in this paper. It is a combination of the univariate dimension-reduction method and the bivariate dimension-reduction method for the balance of efficiency and accuracy. The significant random variables are identified by their variation contributions to the output variation of the objective function and constraints using the univariate dimension-reduction method. The approximate part of the significant random variables in the approximate function is then extended to use the bivariate dimension-reduction method, while the rest of the approximate part is still kept using the univariate dimension-reduction method. It then couples with a numerical optimization algorithm, formulating an iterative robust design-optimization procedure. Two engineering examples are used to illustrate its advantages. The proposed method is found to be competitive in estimating the mean values and standard deviations of the objective function and constraint functions in robust design optimization.",51,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051675,"The performance of a rigid, thin surface flat-plate flapping wing in forward flight, at using different stroke deviation trajectories, has been investigated to assess the different capabilities that such kinematics might offer. The instantaneous lift and thrust profiles were observed to be influenced by a combination of the leading-edge vortex and the trailing-edge vortex structures existing in the flow at any given time. Unlike regular no-deviation flapping cycles, the trailing-edge vortex is shown to be significant for out-of-plane trajectories. Both clockwise and anticlockwise variations for trajectory choice are analyzed for their efficacy as an improved kinematic choice over a no-deviation base case. The power requirements for the different cases, based on the fluid torques, are used as an index of the cost of performance across all cases. The anticlockwise eight-cycle deviation is shown to be very complex with high power costs albeit having better performance. The clockwise O cycle holds promise with being used as a viable stroke deviation trajectory for forward flight over the base case.",51,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051700,"The postbuckling behavior of joined-wing configurations has not been fully addressed in the past. This topic is extensively discussed in this work. Starting from a baseline configuration, geometrical parameters as well as wings’ load repartition are varied to assess their influence on buckling occurrence. The snap-buckling phenomenon and postcritical pattern are investigated with the adoption of the arc-length technique. The complex load transferring through the joint induces a deformation shape that can no longer carry additional load after a critical point is reached. An abrupt snap to a configuration that is not continuously adjacent to the previous one is then observed. Comparison with the instability state obtained via eigenvalue analysis demonstrates that buckling prediction through linear-buckling analysis is inadequate, and often, the actual critical load is overestimated. This study shows that, for PrandtlPlane joined-wing configurations, increasing the height-to-wingspan ratio is beneficial as far as structural response is concerned. This provides an important design guideline because it is well known from previous studies that high height-to-wingspan ratio decreases the induced drag and fuel consumption. The lift repartition and its effects on buckling show that an improvement of the structural stability of the joined-wing airplane can then be achieved by increasing the amount of aerodynamic load on the upper wing while reducing the lift on the lower wing. The strong bending–torsion coupling typical of highly swept joined wings and its influence on the postcritical response are also investigated and discussed.",51,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051702,"An important challenge in launch vehicle simulation and control is created by the time-varying mass and inertia of the vehicle, as well as the consequent changes in modal frequencies and modal shapes of the structure as propellant is exhausted. Estimating modal information from a limited number of onboard sensors is inadequate for attitude control of a launch vehicle in real time, and the use of additional conventional sensors is unwarranted because of the mass penalty and complexity. This limitation has forced mission planners to base vehicle control schemes on pre-calculated modal information from finite element models. Recent advances in fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor technology enable locating a large number of sensing elements along a rocket's structure with a negligible mass penalty. This opens the path for real-time modal estimation and control. This paper presents a novel approach for the real-time estimation of mode shapes on a variable mass structure using FBG sensor arrays. The method is validated by comparing estimated modal shapes to both numerical predictions and experimental results from a vertical cantilever beam in which a step change in mass of the beam is introduced. The results show that the first three mode shapes of the beam can be estimated in real time using strain measurements from a FBG sensor array sampled at 1 kHz. Sensitivity and estimation error based on the number of FBG sensors used is also presented.",51,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051705,"Results from impedance eduction methods developed by NASA Langley Research Center are used throughout the acoustic liner community. Occasional anomalies persist with these methods at frequencies where the liner produces minimal attenuation. An approach to educe impedance spectra with increased confidence is demonstrated, by combining results from successive tests with different cavity depths. First, a raylometer is used to measure the DC flow resistance of three wire-mesh facesheets. These facesheets are then mounted onto frames and a normal incidence tube is used to determine their respective acoustic impedance spectra. Next, each facesheet is successively mounted onto three frames with different cavity depths, and a grazing flow impedance tube is used to educe their respective acoustic impedance spectra with and without mean flow. Since the resonance frequency varies with cavity depth, each sample provides robust results over a different frequency range. Hence, a combination of results can be used to determine the facesheet acoustic resistance. When combined with the acoustic reactance (weakly dependent on the source sound pressure level and grazing flow Mach number), the acoustic impedance can be educed with increased confidence. Representative test results are discussed, and the complete database is available in electronic format upon request.",51,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051722,"In the present work, a new particle–particle hybrid method that combines the statistical ellipsoidal-statistical Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook and direct simulation Monte Carlo methods is developed. The switching criterion between the two methods is based on the deviation of the cumulative velocity distribution function from Maxwellian as measured by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistical test. Unlike other hybrid approaches that use switching criteria based on macroscopic properties, the selection of a particular particle method in a cell is determined by the local Kolmogorov–Smirnov parameter value with respect to a preset global switching criterion. A numerically efficient technique to compute the Kolmogorov–Smirnov parameter was developed to enable the efficient calculation of the degree of nonequilibrium. Two well-known fluid-flow problems, expanding argon flow through a nozzle and hypersonic flow over a blunt body, were studied. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov parameter is shown to demarcate the regions of nonequilibrium from the near-equilibrium regions, and the solutions obtained by the hybrid method are shown to agree well with the benchmark direct simulation Monte Carlo solutions for both case studies. The newly developed hybrid method is also shown to be numerically more efficient than either of the component methods.",51,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051691,"The imperfection-sensitive buckling of fiber-reinforced polymeric laminated shells is complicated by the large number of additional material and geometric parameters compared to the buckling of conventional metallic shells. As a basis for conceptual design, the traditional lower-bound approach of relying upon scatter of test results is no longer feasible when it comes to the buckling design of fiber-reinforced polymeric laminated shells. This study aimed to extend an analytical approach, the so-called reduced-stiffness method, to the lower-bound buckling analysis of fiber-reinforced polymeric laminated cylindrical shells under uniform axial compression. For a range of isotropic shells, the reduced-stiffness method has been shown capable of predicting safe lower bounds to experimental and numerical studies of imperfection-sensitive buckling loads. In this paper, the validity of the reduced-stiffness method applied to fiber-reinforced polymeric laminated cylindrical shells is verified by the nonlinear-buckling analysis performed using the finite element software ABAQUS/Standard. Through several case studies, it is suggested that the reduced-stiffness method offers an important alternative for improved prediction of lower-bound buckling loads in the design of fiber-reinforced polymeric laminated shells.",51,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051732,"This investigation quantifies the beneficial effects of oxygen enrichment on the combustion efficiency and specific thrust of a simplified planar scramjet engine fueled with gaseous hydrogen. Numerical modeling was used to examine the influence of fuel equivalence ratio and enrichment percentage. Broad agreement with experimental data is reported, but the present simulations provide considerably more detail, revealing aspects of the flow physics that could not be discerned from experimental data. Multiple Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations were performed at Mach 12 equivalent freestream conditions with fuel equivalence ratios of 0.8–1.4 and enrichment percentages up to 20%. Trends in combustion efficiency with enrichment percentage are formulated for use in trajectory studies. The combustion efficiency and specific thrust are found to be significantly increased by enriching fuel with oxygen. The increases are greater than those expected from the additional propellant and complete consumption of premixed oxygen. We found that this is due to oxygen enrichment modifying the mixing layer properties within the scramjet such that the production of turbulence and therefore fuel/air mixing is increased. It is also shown that an optimal combustor length exists beyond which internal losses outweigh contributions from combustion.",51,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051759,"A new iterative method is proposed to compute many eigenpair derivatives of damped systems with respect to system parameters. The state-space form of damped system is not used. The proposed method simultaneously computes the derivatives of many eigenpairs, and the solution of many large linear systems of equations with different coefficient matrices is avoided. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be efficiently used for the computation of the derivatives of the eigenpairs with largest magnitude in large symmetric damped systems. Moreover, when the size of system and the number of desired eigenpair derivatives become larger, the proposed method has more advantage.",51,1

Computations are performed by solving the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the elsA code, which is developed by the Office National d'Etudes et de Recherche Aérospatiale–the French Aerospace Lab. Deployable vortex generator computations are compared to a wide set of experimental data, and the actuator effect on the airfoil boundary layer is highlighted. Detailed flow analysis provides an understanding of the vortex generation mechanisms, and the influence of initial vortex interactions and merging over the control effect is shown. The influence of the deployable vortex generator thickness on static stall control efficiency is finally investigated through simulations featuring a deployable vortex generator of reduced thickness.",51,1
