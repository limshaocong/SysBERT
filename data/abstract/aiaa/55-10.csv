0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056292,"It has been shown in recent times that transition to turbulence occurs following two- and three-dimensional routes primarily by what is called the spatiotemporal wave front, for the canonical problem of a zero-pressure gradient boundary layer excited harmonically at the wall following an impulsive start. This paper shows that this onset process of disturbance growth continues also for a varying range of nonimpulsive wall excitation onset that is switched on smoothly. This is important because this will dispel any idea that a spatiotemporal wave front is totally due to impulsive start of wall excitation. This paper distinguishes between high- and low-frequency excitation cases to follow qualitatively different transition routes.",55,10
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056041,"The liquid oscillation mechanism in closed loops that undergo arbitrary accelerations (translational and rotational) was investigated in this paper. The results show that only the Euler force (rather than translational acceleration force, centrifugal force, or Coriolis force) contributes to macroscopic flow in the loop. A concise equation is derived, showing that the driving force of the flow induced by the loop’s motion is equal to twice the negative angular acceleration flux enclosed by the loop. It is similar to Faraday’s law of induction in electromagnetism, and it also follows the right-hand rule. Based on this result, general guidance on how to restrain the influence of structure motion on inner flow is provided. In particular, loops with a “Möbius strip” configuration are capable of completely preventing induced flow in any motion mode of the rigid structures without introduction of extra flow resistance.",55,10
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055202,"Streamwise vortices exist in a number of engineering flows in both external and internal aerodynamics, often with undesirable effects. An experimental investigation of a streamwise vortex–wall interaction is performed through the use of a vortex-generating wing section and a suspended splitter plate. A synthetic jet actuator is implemented below the vortex, and the response of the vortex to unsteady forcing is evaluated with a focus on spatial amplification through convective instabilities. At low forcing frequencies, a large displacement of the vortex is recorded near the actuator, but with almost no spatial amplification. This behavior agrees qualitatively with transient growth studies of columnar vortices. Within a specific frequency range, it is shown that spatial amplification of the vortex displacement occurs. The range of amplified forcing frequency agrees well with predictions for the Crow instability. The vortex–wall interaction generates a secondary vortex structure that rolls up from the boundary layer. When the actuator displaces the primary vortex structure, this causes a strong dynamic reaction in the secondary structure. This occurs due to a mutual induction mechanism between the two vortices as well as a spatial oscillation of the separation point from which the secondary structure originates.",55,10

The work is a collaborative effort to study fundamental, unsteady low-Reynolds-number flows. The motion kinematics is designed to be relevant to the micro air vehicle flight regime. A combination of experimental and computational techniques is used to obtain data for comparison. There is a striking correlation of lift history data and flow topology from both experimental and computational data sets. It is found that the leading/trailing-edge vortex core separation during the initial part of a surge motion can be reasonably well approximated by , and the leading/trailing-edge vortex relative advection velocity is estimated to be . This leading/trailing-edge vortex relative advection velocity is a useful measure of how quickly the trailing-edge vortex moves away from the leading-edge vortex, which can influence lift for accelerating flat plates at high incidence angles.",55,10
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055652,"Under the assumption of a rigid wake aligned with the freestream velocity, a computationally efficient induced drag minimization procedure, tailored for the preliminary design phases of generic multiwing systems, is presented. The method is based on a variational approach, which leads to the formulation of a system of coupled integral equations in the unknown circulation distributions. It is shown that the augmented Munk’s minimum induced drag theorem has general validity for any given number and types of wings. Under optimal conditions, the aerodynamic efficiency of each wing is shown to coincide with the aerodynamic efficiency of the entire system, regardless of the number of wings and their shapes/wingspans; moreover, the aerodynamic load on each wing cannot be negative. In the past, it was demonstrated that changing the sign of curvature did not affect the optimal circulation and minimum induced drag for single nonplanar wings. This has been proven to be a far more general theorem in which, given an arbitrary number of generic nonplanar wings, the optimal circulations, load repartitions, and induced drag do not change if all lifting lines are replaced with mirrored (with respect to the horizontal plane) counterparts. It has also been verified that any wing system internal to a closed wing should be unloaded under optimal conditions, demonstrating that, if canard/tail are added to Box Wings, these additional lifting surfaces should be placed outside the region identified by the closed wing to avoid penalty on the induced drag. Several other properties of multiwings are presented, with emphasis on the relationship between closed and open systems conceptually filling the space identified by the closed wing. Results present several multiwing systems including nonplanar wings and closed systems. It is verified that the optimal conditions of a closed system part of a more complex multiwing can be studied as a limit case of a C-wing whose tips are brought close to each other or as a limit case of a biwing, confirming the generality of previous findings. The classical straight lifting line has been observed to have the minimum optimal aerodynamic efficiency, in terms of induced drag, for a given wingspan and lift if compared to any optimally loaded generic nonplanar open or closed systems.",55,10
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055785,"Subdivision curves are defined as the limit of a recursive application of a subdivision rule to an initial set of control points. This intrinsically provides a hierarchical set of control polygons that can be used to provide surface control at varying levels of fidelity. This work presents a shape parameterization method based on this principle and investigates its application to aerodynamic optimization. The subdivision curves are used to construct a multilevel aerofoil parameterization that allows an optimization to be initialized with a small number of design variables, and then be periodically increased in resolution throughout. This brings the benefits of a low-fidelity optimization (high convergence rate, increased robustness, low-cost finite difference gradients) while still allowing the final results to be from a high-dimensional design space. In this work, the multilevel subdivision parameterization is tested on a variety of optimization problems and compared with a control group of single-level subdivision schemes. For all the optimization cases, the multilevel schemes provided robust and reliable results in contrast to the single-level methods that often experienced difficulties with large numbers of design variables. As a result of this, the multilevel methods exploited the high-dimensional design spaces better and consequently produced better overall results.",55,10
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055766,"Nowadays, classical configurations of civil transportation airplanes are well optimized, with further improvements expected to be of the order of a single drag count. To achieve it, the entire airplane has to be taken into account during the aerodynamic shape optimization, which requires handling complex geometries with computer-aided-design software. So far, the integration of this software and aerodynamic shape optimization has been difficult, due to the framework complexity and problematic gradient evaluation. In this paper, the authors propose to substitute the computer-aided-design engine with a surrogate model of the surface deformation. The resulting framework does not require calls to the computer-aided-design software during the optimization. In addition, the surrogate model has been analytically differentiated and coupled with a mesh-adjoint method based on the radial-basis-functions to enable an efficient gradient-based optimization. The methodology is validated using two cases: a three-dimensional wing geometry in inviscid, transonic-flow conditions and a three-dimensional wing–body–tail configuration in a turbulent and transonic regime.",55,10
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055844,"An efficient approach is proposed to predict acoustic scattering with nonuniform potential flow effects for structures with rotational and translational symmetries. The convected wave equation is transformed to Helmholtz and Laplace equations using a time transformation. The boundary-element method is used to formulate scattering by rotationally symmetric structures as two separate block circulant matrix equations and, similarly, as two separate block Toeplitz matrix equations for structures with translational symmetry. Discrete Fourier transform is employed to solve the block circulant systems. The block Toeplitz systems are solved using the generalized minimal residual method along with the discrete Fourier transform. Solving the convected wave equation using structured matrices significantly reduces computational time and storage requirements. To demonstrate the application of the formulation, two exterior acoustic case studies are considered. The first case study examines acoustic scattering from a sphere submerged in potential flow under monopole source excitation. Directivity plots obtained using the proposed technique are compared with analytical results. The second case study examines flow-induced noise generated by a rigid cylinder immersed in low-Mach-number flow, with the effect of mean flow on the scattered acoustic field taken into account using nonuniform potential flow. The fluctuating flowfield is obtained using an incompressible computational fluid dynamics solver. Acoustic sources based on Lighthill’s analogy are extracted from the flowfield data using a high-order reconstruction scheme. Results from the hybrid computational fluid dynamics– boundary-element method technique are presented for turbulent flow past the cylinder, with Reynolds number based on cylinder diameter of and Mach number . The aeroacoustic results are compared with data from literature.",55,10
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055598,"The acoustics of a mean flow boundary layer over an impedance surface or acoustic lining is considered. By considering a thick mean flow boundary layer (possibly due to turbulence), the boundary-layer structure is separated asymptotically into two decks, with a thin weakly viscous mean flow boundary layer and an even thinner strongly viscous acoustic sublayer, without requiring a high frequency. Using this, analytic solutions are found for the acoustic modes in a cylindrical lined duct. The mode shapes in each region compare well with numerical solutions of the linearized compressible Navier–Stokes equations, as does a uniform composite asymptotic solution. A closed-form effective impedance boundary condition is derived, which can be applied to acoustics in inviscid slipping flow to account for both shear and viscosity in the boundary layer. The importance of the boundary layer is demonstrated in the frequency domain, and the new boundary condition is found to correctly predict the attenuation of upstream-propagating cut-on modes, which are poorly predicted by existing inviscid boundary conditions. Stability is also investigated, and the new boundary condition is found to yield good results away from the critical layer. A time-domain formulation of a simplified version of the new impedance boundary condition is proposed.",55,10
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055720,"Cavity flows are present in a wide range of aerospace applications. The pressure fluctuations associated with cavity resonance have made them the target of significant flow control efforts aimed at suppressing resonance. A potential scramjet application for cavity flows may require resonance enhancement in addition to resonance suppression. Localized arc filament plasma actuators have demonstrated the ability to control a high subsonic cavity flow. This work investigates the control authority of the localized arc filament plasma actuators in a supersonic cavity flow. The localized arc filament plasma actuators significantly suppress the primary cavity resonance of a naturally and strongly resonating cavity. Additionally, the trend in effectiveness suggests that introducing mode competition through the excitation of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, and thereby influencing the shear-layer structure formation process, is the likely control mechanism. The effects of two-dimensional and three-dimensional excitation are explored. Although two-dimensional excitation achieves the greatest resonance suppression, three-dimensional excitation shows similar suppression with significantly less sensitivity to the excitation Strouhal number, making it more desirable for practical applications. In a weakly resonating cavity, the flow significantly responds to excitation near the resonance Strouhal numbers. However, electromagnetic interference makes it difficult to quantify the level of resonance enhancement.",55,10

The flowfield above the helideck is experimentally analyzed using stereo particle image velocimetry, unsteady pressure sensors, and hot-wire anemometry. Results show a successful reduction of the recirculation region with continuous steady blowing around the hangar, observed at different yaw angles. It is shown that active flow control alters the airwake in a manner different from that passive devices. Locally, the turbulence levels are increased around the separated region boundaries when control is applied, whereas they are decreased in the wake downstream of the helideck. The frequency contents of the different airwake structures are not modified.",55,10
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055728,"This paper presents a multivariable closed-loop active flow control strategy to control the pressure rise and the wake size of a compressor stator cascade. For flow control, a combination of two actuator concepts, trailing-edge and sidewall blowing, was applied to a linear stator cascade. Detailed five-hole probe measurements of the downstream flowfield at a Reynolds number of were carried out to reveal the effect of the actuation on the cascade flow. An increase in the pressure rise coefficient by 5% and a significant reduction of the wake size could be achieved with the investigated actuation amplitudes of values up to 2.5%. Principal component analysis was used to find coherent structures in the full measurement data set. Based on this analysis, a real-time estimation of the complex downstream flowfield with only three pressure sensors was realized. With this estimation, linear dynamic black-box models for the pressure rise coefficient and the wake size were identified. Variable reference signals with a Strouhal number of 0.03, specified by a later application in a pressure gain combustion system, were successfully tracked, leading to small experimental control errors.",55,10
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054850,"Overset and Cartesian solvers typically employ conventional time-marching schemes to simulate unsteady flows. Temporal pseudospectral schemes have demonstrated the ability to dramatically reduce the computational effort required to resolve the important subclass of time-periodic phenomena. Incorporating the time-spectral method within these approaches is desirable, but direct application is infeasible. Relative motion introduces dynamic blanking of spatial nodes which move interior to solid bodies; the solution at such nodes is therefore undefined over specific intervals of time. This proves problematic for the conventional time-spectral method because it expands the temporal variation at every node as an infinitely supported Fourier series. An extension of the time-spectral method is presented where dynamically blanked nodes are handled in an alternative manner; the solution through intervals of consecutively unblanked time samples are represented with barycentric rational interpolants. The Fourier- and rational interpolant-based differentiation operators are applied in tandem, providing a hybrid time-spectral scheme capable of consistently resolving relative motion on overlapping meshes. The hybrid scheme is applied to relevant cases in two and three spatial dimensions and the results demonstrate that the hybrid scheme mirrors the performance of the conventional time-spectral method and monotonically converges to analogous high-resolution, time-accurate simulations with increasing temporal modes.",55,10
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055885,"Solution methods for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations based on finite volume discretizations often implement boundary conditions using ghost cells outside of the computational domain. Filling the ghost cells using straightforward zeroth- or first-order extrapolation, although computationally expedient, is well known to fail even for some simple flows, especially when turbulent structures interact with the boundaries or if time-varying inflow conditions are imposed. The Navier–Stokes characteristic boundary condition approach provides more accurate boundary conditions, but requires the use of special discretizations at boundaries. The present paper develops a new technique based on the Navier–Stokes characteristic boundary condition approach to derive values for ghost cells that significantly improve the treatment of boundaries over simple extrapolation, but retain the ghost cell approach. It is demonstrated in the context of a Godunov integration procedure that the new method provides accurate results, while allowing the use of the same stencil and numerical methodology near the boundaries as in the interior.",55,10

The key enhancements include a multicolor line-implicit preconditioner, a discretely consistent symmetry boundary condition, and a line-mapping method for the turbulence source term discretization. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions have been computed using a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model and families of uniformly refined nested grids on two three-dimensional configurations, namely, a bump in a channel and a hemisphere cylinder. Iterative convergence of two hierarchical adaptive nonlinear iteration method approaches using line- and point-implicit preconditioners has been compared with the iterative convergence of the point-implicit preconditioner-alone method that broadly represents the baseline solver technology. The line-implicit hierarchical adaptive nonlinear iteration method shows superior iterative convergence with progressively increasing benefits on finer grids.",55,10
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055717,"Simulations of an ideally expanded supersonic jet for two operating temperatures are conducted with a low aspect ratio of two rectangular nozzle, and an equivalent diameter circular nozzle of the same design Mach number. The emphasis is on accurately resolving the near-field data, capturing the far-field acoustics, and examining the flow asymmetry of the rectangular jets. The simulated acoustic data of the cold and heated jets are validated against experimentally recorded sound-pressure-level spectra with very good agreement. Rectangular nozzle metrics are calculated in two orthogonal, axial spanning planes to determine the impact of the nozzle exit asymmetry, and then they are compared with the circular jet. The shock cell structure, the jet core length, and the axial distribution of the flow at similar radial distances (normalized by the major, minor, or circular radial lengths) are observed to be different between the two planes of the rectangular jet and relative to the circular jet. The dynamics of the large-scale coherent structures differ between the rectangular and the circular jets, in the near-nozzle region, with streamwise vorticity and corner effects being a factor in the rectangular jets, leading to enhanced entrainment. The upstream counter rotating streamwise vortex pairs and their subsequent interaction inhibits axis switching for the rectangular jet cases presented. Overall, far-field noise in the major and minor axis planes is lower than the circular jet for the cold case; however, the noise spectra collapses in the heated case, despite dissimilarities in the near-field flow structures between rectangular and circular jets.",55,10
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055525,"Four numerical simulations of the NASA Active Noise Control Fan rig with some modifications have been performed to investigate the influence of the heterogeneity of the stator row on the tonal noise radiation for a realistic turbofan with a high hub-to-tip ratio. These simulations achieved with the Powerflow solver based on the lattice Boltzmann method provide a direct acoustic prediction for both tonal and broadband noise. The numerical simulations are used to evaluate the noise contributions of the rotor-wake interaction with the stator vanes, and the rotor interaction with both the inlet distortion and the potential field generated by the stator row. Analytical models are evaluated on this configuration using the flow description provided by the simulations. Rotor-wake and inlet-distortion interaction noise generation with in-duct propagation uses the classical Amiet’s response, whereas Parry’s model is used for the rotor response to the potential field. The simulation is used to evaluate simple excitation models for the potential field and the rotor-wake evolutions. The analytical results for homogeneous and heterogeneous configurations compare well with the detailed acoustic modal powers extracted from the direct acoustic field simulated with Powerflow. The wake interaction remains the dominant source in the present heterogeneous configurations.",55,10

The novelty of the present research is that an advanced method is proposed to locate fictitious interior observers inside the scattering surface, contributing to that the incident acoustic pressure received by the fictitious interior observers can be efficiently computed. Numerical cases show that the developed method ensures high computational accuracy and significantly improves the computational efficiency compared with existing methods, showing an appealing application potential in efficiently predicting rotor noise scattered by the shaft and casing.

18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055952,"A systematic study is carried out to investigate the flow dynamics and mixing of liquid oxygen/kerosene bi-swirl injectors at supercritical conditions. The theoretical framework is based on the full conservation laws and accommodates real fluid thermodynamics and transport theories over the entire range of fluid states. Turbulence closure is achieved using large-eddy simulation. A grid independence study was conducted to ensure appropriate numerical resolution and accurate flow physics. The liquid-film atomization and breakup processes at subcritical conditions are replaced by the turbulent mixing and diffusion processes typical at supercritical conditions. Various injector geometries, with differences in the recess region, post thickness, and kerosene annulus width, are examined to explore the influence of geometry on mixing efficiency and flow dynamics. A critical mixing line is defined to measure the mixedness of propellants. The presence of a recess region is found to advance the interaction of liquid oxygen and kerosene and improve mixing efficiency. A thicker post of the inner swirler or a wider annulus leads to a larger spreading angle of the inner liquid oxygen film and intercepts the outer kerosene film in a broader area, thereby enhancing mixing in the recess region. The flow structures in the recess region are complex, and the kerosene mass fraction decreases significantly near the post surface, which might increase the thermal load on the surface in the case of reacting flows. Appropriate selection of the post thickness, recess length, and annulus width must be carefully determined for optimum injector performance. The present study offers useful information in bi-swirl injector design and in studies of the underlying flow physics of swirl injection under supercritical conditions.",55,10

The model was established based on the reactivity of different carbon phases (fibers and matrix), the surface recession control mechanism, and spatial characteristics of the composites to understand the origin of the ablation behavior. The level set method and the weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme were used to obtain the evolution of transient ablation morphologies on the microscale and the mesoscale. The multiscale thermochemical ablation model and numerical framework were validated by using experimental data from a small solid rocket motor and a submerged nozzle throat of large solid rocket motor.

A combined numerical–experimental approach relying on dual particle image velocimetry measurements and large-eddy simulations is used to optimize and validate a method allowing the reconstruction of spectral quantities from cross-correlations sampled at an arbitrary low sampling frequency from a Taylor-like hypothesis. The method, previously applied to a slowly streamwise developing boundary-layer flow, is refined so as to be able to better cope with flows having a higher degree of inhomogeneity. The accuracy and robustness of the resulting spectral estimates are evaluated in various characteristic regions distributed over the whole shock-wave/turbulent boundary-layer interaction flowfield thanks to the long-time large-eddy simulation database. Metrics allowing an a priori evaluation of the accuracy are also derived. Velocity spectra are then obtained from the experiments for the same locations.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055839,"A methodology is presented for prediction of dynamic instabilities arising from fluid–structure coupling. The inviscid compressible Euler equations are linearized about a steady-state solution and converted to the frequency domain for evaluation of the unsteady generalized aerodynamic forces used in the flutter solution procedure. The coupled fluid–structure interaction problem is formulated as a linearized stability eigenvalue problem. Using Schur complement factorization, an assumption of harmonic frequency response, and projection onto the structural modal basis, the stability equations are rewritten in a form well known as the flutter solution method. The scheme is used to study the flutter instability boundary of simply supported semi-infinite and square panels in the transonic and low supersonic region for mass ratio 0.1. The critical instability at subsonic Mach numbers is divergence (zero frequency), whereas oscillatory unstable modes are found for all Mach numbers greater than 1.0. At low supersonic Mach numbers ( for semi-infinite panel and for square panel), multiple high-frequency flutter modes become critical in a very narrow range of dynamic pressures. For higher Mach numbers, the classic supersonic flutter mode is recovered for both panels.",55,10
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055852,"Aeroelastic limit-cycle oscillations due to aerodynamic nonlinearities are usually investigated using coupled fluid–structure interaction simulations in the time domain. These simulations are computationally expensive, especially if a large number of limit-cycle oscillation solutions must be computed to study the Hopf bifurcation behavior in the immediate surroundings of the flutter point. To facilitate such bifurcation parameter studies, an adaptation of the well-known p-k flutter analysis method is proposed in this paper. In this method, the first harmonic of the motion-induced unsteady aerodynamic forces is no longer assumed to be solely determined by constant-coefficient frequency response functions. Instead, the nonlinear dependence on the oscillation amplitudes and the phase angle between the input degrees of freedom are additionally taken into account. Therefore, the first harmonic Fourier components of the aerodynamic forces are sampled and interpolated in advance. The limit-cycle oscillation solution is then found iteratively. The proposed amplitude-dependent p-k method is applied to a classic two-degree-of-freedom spring-mounted airfoil system, where the nonlinear aerodynamic forces are computed from Euler simulations. Fluid–structure interaction simulations are performed for validation of the method. Both methods show good agreement. Furthermore, the amplitude-dependent p-k method is shown to be a useful tool to rapidly study structural parameter variations.",55,10

Two different probabilistic approaches are compared alongside a deterministic method for the aeroelastic design of composite plate wings with uncertain ply orientations. The instability speed is found to be a discontinuous function of the lamination parameters, which are themselves functions of the ply orientations. A surrogate modeling approach is presented in which Gaussian processes are combined with support vector machines to emulate the discontinuous instability speed to efficiently propagate uncertainty through the model. The surrogate model is used to calculate the objectives of two optimization strategies: a reliability-based design, in which the probability of aeroelastic instability occurring within the design envelope is minimized, and a robust design, in which the mean and standard deviation of the instability speed are traded off. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize the layup, and reductions in the probability of failure of 94% are achieved in the reliability-based design using a design speed, relative to benchmark deterministic designs.

While calibrating and validating models, the choice of a metric can significantly influence the outcome, yet the published research discussing the role of metrics, in particular, varying levels of statistical information the metrics can contain, has been limited. This paper calibrates and validates the model predictions using alternative metrics formulated based on three types of distance-based criteria: 1) Euclidian distance (i.e., the absolute geometric distance between two points), 2) Mahalanobis distance (i.e., the weighted distance that considers the correlations of two point clouds), and 3) Bhattacharyya distance (i.e., the statistical distance between two point clouds considering their probabilistic distributions). A comparative study is presented in the first case study, where the influence of various metrics, and the varying levels of statistical information they contain, on the predictions of the calibrated models is evaluated.

For this purpose, a finite element model is divided into multiple segments along its span. For each segment, a modal analysis is carried out. Boundary grid points are defined on each segment and loaded by fictitious masses. The modal analysis produces a set of elastic modes and six rigid-body modes that have significant deformations near the boundary. These deformations facilitate high-accuracy integration of the segments into a coupled model, in which the fictitious masses are removed. The elastic modes are used as master modes that describe the deformation, whereas the rigid-body modes are used as slave modes to establish displacement compatibility between the segments. The modal analysis is carried out with the local segment attached to its own reference frame, yielding a local linear solution that is part of a global nonlinear analysis. Large rotations and displacements are provided by the rigid-body modes in a corotational framework.",55,10

Surrogates are used to predict strength of composite laminates in the design space by conducting an array of tests. It has been reported that an exploration strategy to test as many different configurations as possible is more effective than replication of fewer points for reducing test noise. The observation was based on analytical test functions and synthetic Gaussian noise. This paper first studies real experiments to check whether the previous observation stands. Test results of open-hole tension for composite plates that included 18 replicates per configuration were examined. A resampling procedure was developed that compared exploration and replication, and it was found that exploration proved to be more accurate for prediction than replication. Second, the major source of uncertainty for surrogate prediction was examined, which is variability of strength. The distribution of experimental open-hole tension strength was found to be not unambiguously independent and was identically distributed normal distribution as commonly assumed. The variation of specimen strength is correlated rather than independent at different configurations due to the between-batch variability. Consequently, the influence of distribution type was then investigated on an analytical test function with three synthetic distributions. The exploration strategy proved to be better than the replication strategy for all three distributions. It was found that the exploration strategy allows for higher-order polynomial surrogate to be used, which is a key point to improve characterization of a function with complex dependence on design parameters.",55,10
