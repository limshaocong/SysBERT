An integrated numerical model consisting of a dielectric barrier discharge electrohydrodynamic body force model and a computational fluid dynamics package called NavyFOAM is employed in this study. Comparison of current computational results against experimental data indicates reasonable agreement between the two studies for the baseline flow as well as controlled cases using two alternating current waveforms including sine and pulse-amplitude-modulated sine with different modulation frequencies. Performance of the actuator is also examined for square and pulse alternating current waveforms. It is found that, at the experimental conditions, the pulse-amplitude-modulated sine waveform provides the most lift enhancement in comparison with other waveforms used in this study, despite the least power input that it requires to operate. The effect of the input voltage amplitude on the performance of the actuator is also examined for the sine and pulse-amplitude-modulated sine waveforms. It is shown that, beyond a critical voltage, the sine wave is more effective in improving the aerodynamic performance of the airfoil than the other waveform.",54,8

Enhanced directional control using flow-control technology can potentially result in reduced fuel consumption and improved airplane performance. The numerical method is based on the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes formulation for overset grid systems. The flow control is modeled for an array of synthetic jet actuators mounted at the trailing edge of the stabilizer. Results of the validation for various flow conditions, actuation parameters, and port layouts are used to establish the accuracy of the numerical tool. The side-force increments on the tail due to flow control at various sideslip conditions are presented. Sensitivities to flow-control layouts, especially with respect to spanwise flow development, are also investigated. A practical approach to facilitate preliminary evaluations of active flow control with quick computational turnaround is proposed. It is shown that constant actuation can be used as proxy for predicting the effects of the unsteady actuation from synthetic jets. Its confirmation in the context of the current application has been invaluable for developing practical flow-control implementations. Aspects of integration are presented, and guidelines for preferred modes of actuation are put forth.",54,8
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054424,"Recently, a renewed interest toward vertical-axis wind turbines has developed, due to the increasing need of a rational utilization of renewable energy resources. In vertical-axis wind turbines, each blade undergoes a wide variation of angle of attack during one rotation, with important dynamic stall phenomena. Neglecting wake-to-wake interactions and curvature effects, a pitching airfoil is a good representation of the flow experienced by the blades of a vertical-axis wind turbine. In the present work, the flow around an Eppler 387 airfoil in pure pitching is investigated, exploring a parametric space tailored to vertical-axis wind-turbine applications. In such a case, the angle of attack varies in the range , resulting in large-amplitude pitching oscillations. The Reynolds number, based on the freestream velocity and the chord length, is set to . In this sense, the present work differs from earlier studies, where typically the combined heaving and pitching or pure pitching for propulsion purposes have been considered, which are characterized by higher frequencies and smaller amplitudes and mainly positive angles of attack. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the force coefficients and how their evolution is affected by the dynamics of the flow structures generated during pitch-up and pitch-down of the airfoil is presented. Furthermore, it is shown that a modified Strouhal number, which takes into account both frequency and amplitude, is an appropriate metric for the performance of an airfoil in these conditions.",54,8
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054408,"Rapid sensing of body motions is critical to stabilizing a flight vehicle in the presence of exogenous disturbances as well as providing high-performance tracking of desired control commands. This bandwidth requirement becomes more stringent as vehicle scale decreases. Many flying insects employ distributed networks of acceleration-sensitive sensors to provide information about body egomotion to rapidly detect forces and torques. In this work, a method for rapid sensing of force and torque using a distributed array of accelerometers, arbitrarily placed and rigidly affixed to a vehicle airframe, was developed. Simulations of the sensor array were performed to quantify the effects of sensor noise, sensor position error, and sensor number on acceleration state estimates. A hardware implementation of this distributed sensor array was designed and integrated into the avionics of a small quadrotor vehicle. The response of the array to induced acceleration stimuli was characterized. A linear state estimation matrix was derived from the calibration to directly estimate the total forces and torques exerted on the airframe. A force-adaptive control law utilizing the force and torque estimates provided by the sensor network was implemented to improve tracking of reference states while rejecting exogenous force and torque disturbances. Successful rejection of disturbances in the form of internal actuator variation and external wind gusts was demonstrated on the quadrotor vehicle in flight.",54,8
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054326,"Flapping of an insect wing can be broadly separated into sweeping, elevating, and rotational motions. The sweeping motion generates forward velocity, and the rotational motion imposes an appropriate angle of attack; both are vital to lift generation. However, the purpose of elevating motion in insect flight remains unclear. In this paper, the aim is to better understand the effects of elevating motion to lift generation and vortex structure development when rigid wings are subjected to three-dimensional simple harmonic motion and hovering hawkmoth flapping motion. Both experimental and numerical techniques are used, and results show that, among the different types of simple harmonic motions considered here, only figure-of-eight motions at a relatively low midstroke angle of attack (25 deg) outperform flapping motions without elevating motion. In this case, lift is enhanced by approximately 11% with insignificant cost to hovering efficiency. The lift enhancement could be attributed to rapid growth of the leading-edge vortex, due to an increase in instantaneous angle of attack when the wing elevates downward during midstroke. For the hawkmoth motion, a small elevating motion has minimal aerodynamic effects, whereas a large one causes reduction in lift due to detachment of the leading-edge vortex from the wing surface. Generally, elevating motion affects lift and power coefficients via four mechanisms: alteration of instantaneous angle of attack, introduction of radial force component, wake capture, and early shedding of leading-edge vortex. Although elevating motion confers a significant lift enhancement to specific sets of flapping-wing kinematics, it is generally detrimental to flight performance.",54,8
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054567,"In this paper, a triangular planar element is developed for a geometrically nonlinear structural analysis, which includes the drilling degrees of freedom using a corotational framework. Based on the assumptions of a small degree of strain and large displacement, the corotational framework allows an accurate geometrically nonlinear structural analysis. The presently improved corotational framework accommodates in-plane rotational behavior (that is, the drilling degrees of freedom) by using the corotational framework corresponding to a solidlike planar element. It focuses on triangular planar elements that will be useful for three-dimensional analysis using a reduced number of degrees while targeting a structure with a complex geometry, such as a flapping wing. Regarding the present analysis, validation by solving both static and time-transient problems is conducted. The fluid–structure interaction framework is then developed by using the present structural analysis. During this validation procedure, the present results are compared with those obtained with three-dimensional solid elements provided by the commercial software ANSYS. Finally, a relevant fluid–structure interaction analysis for the flapping wing is conducted and an examination of the usefulness of the present planar element is done through comparisons between experimental results and those obtained in earlier studies.",54,8
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054675,"Three different sets of experiments are designed to reveal the behavior of the vortex flow over a delta wing with different fin heights. A sharp-edged flat-plate delta wing with an 82.6-deg-sweep angle is tested in low-speed wind tunnels at angles of attack up to 35 deg. The same tests are performed on an identical delta-wing model but with a flat-plate dorsal fin. The ratio of the local fin height to the local wing semispan varies from 0.3 to 1.5. The results of smoke laser-sheet visualization, particle image velocimetry, and force measurement are obtained and presented. The test results show that the vortices over the delta-wing-alone model at high angles of attack and zero sideslip are stable, symmetric, and steady before vortex breakdown, but a low dorsal fin renders the originally symmetric vortices asymmetric at the same angle of attack; the flow recovers symmetry and conicity when a higher fin is added. These results are in agreement with predictions by the stability theory Cai et al. , (“ Stability of Symmetric Vortices in Two Dimensions and over Three-Dimensional Slender Conical Bodies ,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics , Vol.  null , 2003 , pp.  65 – 94 ). This agreement demonstrates that the absolute type of instability is responsible for loss of symmetry of the vortices over a delta wing with a fin within the range of tested conditions.",54,8
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054733,"The influence of an afterbody on an axisymmetric wake flow is investigated with two-component particle image velocimetry at a Reynolds number of based on the model diameter. The reattachment distance is found to vary from two to four step heights as the afterbody diameter is increased. Measurements performed on equivalent planar backward-facing step geometries reveal that the reattachment length scales similarly to a planar backward-facing step when the afterbody to main-body diameter ratio approaches unity. The distribution of turbulent normal and shear stresses reveals a progressive inhibition of the radial fluctuations for increasing afterbody diameter, whereas a proper orthogonal decomposition analysis highlights a concurrent weakening of the shear-layer flapping mode. For , the frequency spectrum of the time coefficient of the first proper orthogonal decomposition mode appears associated with the wake flapping motion and peaks in the range of . This frequency is associated with the recirculating flow unsteadiness observed in the azimuthal plane of the wake. The configuration without afterbody features an additional contribution at , which is associated with vortex shedding. The current results reveal the dependence of low-frequency unsteadiness upon changes in the afterbody diameter.",54,8
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054820,"Coherent structures formed within the laminar separation bubble on the suction side of a NACA 0018 airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of 100,000 and an angle of attack of 5 deg are investigated experimentally using a combination of surface pressure measurements; time-resolved flow visualization; and time-resolved planar two-component particle image velocimetry. The results show that strongly periodic shear-layer vortices form in the separation bubble due to the amplification of disturbances in the fore portion of the bubble. These structures feature strong spanwise coherence at rollup; however, they deform rapidly upstream of the mean reattachment location. Spanwise undulations in the vortex filaments develop in a nonperiodic fashion, with the spanwise wavelength shown to be approximately two times the streamwise spacing of the shed structures. It is demonstrated that these spanwise deformations lead to regions of local vortex breakup, which expand rapidly as the vortices approach the mean reattachment point. This is associated with a rapid decay of the spanwise coherence length, which reaches a constant minimum value typical of turbulent boundary layers just downstream of mean reattachment. The results demonstrate that the development of shear-layer vortices plays the fundamental role in the formation of the separation bubble, and the later stages of transition are directly related to the breakup of these structures in the aft portion of the separation bubble.",54,8
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054684,"The topology and evolution of three-dimensional flow past a cylinder of slenderness ratio mounted in a wind tunnel is examined for (based on the diameter of the cylinder) where steady-state solutions have been obtained. Direct numerical simulations were computed using an in-house parallel finite element code. The three-dimensional theory of separation is used to analyze and interpret the flow phenomena. Results indicate that symmetry breaking occurs at , while the first prominent structure is a horseshoe vortex downstream from the cylinder. At , two foci are observed, indicating the formation of two tornadolike vortices downstream. Concurrently, another horseshoe vortex is formed upstream from the cylinder. For higher Reynolds numbers, the flow downstream is segmented to upper and lower parts, whereas the topology of the flow on the solid boundaries remains unaltered. Pressure distributions show that pressure, the key physical parameter in the flow, decreases everywhere except immediately upstream from the cylinder. In addition, creation of critical points from saddle-node-type bifurcations occur when the streamwise component of the pressure gradient changes sign. Finally, at , an additional horseshoe vortex is formed at the wake of the cylinder. In all computations, an absence of critical points was observed on the free end of the cylinder.",54,8
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054632,"Direct numerical simulation is used to investigate the transition induced by three-dimensional isolated roughness elements in a supersonic boundary layer at a freestream Mach number of 3.5. Simulations are performed for two different configurations: one is a square planform roughness element, and the other is a diamond planform roughness element. The mean flow calculations show that the roughness element induces counter-rotating streamwise vortices downstream of the roughness element. These vortices persist for a long distance downstream, lift the low-momentum fluid from the near-wall region, and place it near the outer part of the boundary layer. This forms highly inflectional boundary-layer profiles. These observations agree with recent experimental observations. The receptivity calculations show that the amplitudes of the mass-flux fluctuations near the neutral point for the diamond-shaped roughness element are the same as the amplitude of the acoustic disturbances. They are three times smaller for the square-shaped roughness element.",54,8
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054669,"Three-dimensional shock control bumps have long been investigated for their promising wave drag reduction capability. However, a recently emerging application has been their deployment as “smart” vortex generators, which offset the parasitic drag of their vortices against their wave drag reduction. It is known that three-dimensional shock control bumps produce streamwise vortices under most operating conditions; however, there have been very few investigations that have aimed to specifically examine the relevant flow structures. In particular, the strength of the vortices produced as well as the factors influencing their production are not well known. This paper uses a joint experimental and computational approach to test three different shock control bump shapes, categorizing their flow structures. Four common key vortical structures are observed, predominantly shear flows, although all bumps also produce a streamwise vortex pair. Both cases with and without flow separation on the bump tails are scrutinized. Finally, correlations between the strength of the main wake vortices and pressure gradients at various locations on the bumps are assessed to investigate which parts of the flow control the vortex formation. Spanwise flows on the bump ramp are seen to be the most influential factor in vortex strength.",54,8
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054688,"Fluid–structure interactions that occur during aircraft internal store carriage were experimentally explored at Mach 0.58–1.47 using a generic, aerodynamic store installed in a rectangular cavity having a length-to-depth ratio of seven. The store vibrated in response to the cavity flow at its natural structural frequencies, and it exhibited a directionally dependent response to cavity resonance frequencies. Cavity tones excited the store in the streamwise and wall-normal directions consistently, whereas the spanwise response to cavity tones was much more limited. Increased surface area associated with tail fins raised vibration levels. The store had interchangeable components to vary its natural frequencies by about 10–300 Hz. By tuning natural frequencies, mode-matched cases were explored where a prominent cavity tone frequency matched a structural natural frequency of the store. Mode matching in the streamwise and wall-normal directions produced substantial increases in peak store vibrations, though the response of the store remained linear with dynamic pressure. Near mode-matched frequencies, changes in cavity tone frequencies of only 1% altered store peak vibrations by as much as a factor of two. Mode matching in the spanwise direction did little to increase vibrations.",54,8
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054350,"A stall inception model of centrifugal compressors is developed on the basis of the global stability analysis in the present paper. This model takes specific flow patterns and impeller geometry into account, which can be used to analyze the effect of blade design parameters on the stall limit of centrifugal compressors. In particular, the body force model and the solution of the stability eigenvalue equation are two important problems to be addressed in this frame. The spectral method and singular value decomposition are used to discrete stability equations to obtain the eigenvalues. By applying conservation laws, a perturbation-response form of the body force, specifically for centrifugal compressor, is also established to simulate blade behavior. Two different forms (the meridional model and the normal expansion model) are derived to make a comparison of grid independence and computation time. The capacity of these models is assessed against the experimental data of a NASA low-speed centrifugal compressor rotor. The results show that these models could be used to predict stall onset with acceptable accuracy and low computational cost.",54,8
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054438,"This paper presents the study of the tip-clearance flow in an axial compressor using several turbulence-modeling approaches: Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, and zonal detached-eddy simulation. Rotor simulations are carried out on the same mesh based on the zonal-detached-eddy-simulation requirements, and compared to experimental data. Zonal detached-eddy simulation brings significant improvements over Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approaches to reach accurate integral values, especially the total-pressure-gradient prediction near the casing, as well as to capture complex flow patterns near the casing. Whereas the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes method predicts only tip-leakage and induced vortices, the zonal-detached-eddy-simulation approach is able to reveal more complex phenomena as the tip-leakage vortex, the contra-rotative induced vortex, and numerous secondary vortices are captured. Because of their interaction with the tip-leakage vortex, secondary vortices roll up around it. This leads to the generation of smaller vortices. The interaction between the tip-leakage vortices and the incoming stator wake, the latter being made up of the blade wake itself along with a tip vortex and a hub vortex, is evaluated, and a tip-leakage-vortex-flutter phenomenon is detailed. A spectral analysis reveals a major difference between unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and zonal detached-eddy simulation concerning the tip-leakage-vortex disruption. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach dissipates the tip-leakage vortex across the weak shock present at the blade tip, and thus, captures only the first three harmonics of the blade-passing frequency. On the contrary, with the zonal-detached-eddy-simulation method, the first 10 harmonics are well captured, and the tip-leakage vortex further develops beyond the shock leading to a better prediction of velocity and pressure fluctuations.",54,8
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054861,"A deformable overset grid method is proposed to simulate the unsteady aerodynamic problems with multiple flexible moving bodies. This method uses an unstructured overset grid coupled with local mesh deformation to achieve both robustness and efficiency. The overset grid hierarchically organizes the subgrids into clusters and layers, allowing for overlapping/embedding of different type meshes, in which the mesh quality and resolution can be independently controlled. At each time step, mesh deformation is locally applied to the subgrids associated with deforming bodies by an improved Delaunay graph mapping method that uses a very coarse Delaunay mesh as the background graph. The graph is moved and deformed by the spring analogy method according to the specified motion, and then the computational meshes are relocated by a simple one-to-one mapping. An efficient implicit hole-cutting and intergrid boundary definition procedure is implemented fully automatically for both cell-centered and cell-vertex schemes based on the wall distance and an alternative digital tree data search algorithm. This method is successfully applied to several complex multibody unsteady aerodynamic simulations, and the results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method for complex unsteady flow problems, particularly for those involving simultaneous large relative motion and self-deformation.",54,8
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054659,"Experiments were conducted in the X2 expansion tube to measure vacuum ultraviolet radiation from shock layers representative of reentry conditions at flight equivalent velocities of 10.0 and . Cylindrical models of varying lengths were used to make measurements of different depths of radiating gases. Spectral emission measurements were made, imaging parallel to the surface of the models along the stagnation streamline. Ratios of integrated spectral bands were compared to quantify increases in radiance with increasing depth of radiating gas. Significant increases in observed radiance were measured with increasing model length. Comparisons were made with simulations that assumed an optically thin shock layer, and it was found that over 98.9% of the total vacuum ultraviolet radiation emitted was self-absorbed. Good agreement was found between the simulations and measurements of total radiance for the different depths of radiating gas. These results highlight the need to accurately quantify the opacity of a shock layer and spectral line broadening because it significantly increases the radiance emitted from the shock layer in the vacuum ultraviolet region.",54,8

This paper phenomenologically explores this interaction using a fundamental two-dimensional aerothermoelastic model under the assumption of an aluminum panel with simple supports. Specifically, an existing model is extended to examine the impact of transition onset location, transition length, and transitional overshoot in heat flux and fluctuating pressure on the structural response of surface panels. Transitional flow conditions are found to yield significantly increased thermal gradients, and they can result in higher maximum panel temperatures compared to turbulent flow. Results indicate that overshoot in heat flux and fluctuating pressure reduces the flutter onset time and increases the strain energy accumulated in the panel. Furthermore, overshoot occurring near the midchord can yield average temperatures and peak displacements exceeding those experienced by the panel subject to turbulent flow. These results suggest that fully turbulent flow does not always conservatively predict the thermo-structural response of surface panels.",54,8
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054758,"Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models are not very accurate for high-Reynolds-number compressible jet-in-crossflow interactions. The inaccuracy arises from the use of inappropriate model parameters and model-form errors in the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model. In this work, the hypothesis is pursued that Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes predictions can be significantly improved by using parameters inferred from experimental measurements of a supersonic jet interacting with a transonic crossflow. A Bayesian inverse problem is formulated to estimate three Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes parameters , and a Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to develop a probability density function for them. The cost of the Markov chain Monte Carlo is addressed by developing statistical surrogates for the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model. It is found that only a subset of the space supports realistic flow simulations. is used as a prior belief when formulating the inverse problem. It is enforced with a classifier in the current Markov chain Monte Carlo solution. It is found that the calibrated parameters improve predictions of the entire flowfield substantially when compared to the nominal/literature values of ; furthermore, this improvement is seen to hold for interactions at other Mach numbers and jet strengths for which the experimental data are available to provide a comparison.

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054653,"Adaptive high-resolution simulations of gaseous detonation using a hot-jet initiation were conducted in supersonic combustible mixtures with spatially nonuniform species. The two-dimensional Euler equations were used as the governing equations in combination with a detailed hydrogen–oxygen reaction model. Three different groups of mixtures, which represent various degrees of chemical reactivity, were investigated. The results show that, when the mixtures generally have a high degree of chemical reactivity, detonation initiation can eventually be realized successfully by Mach reflection as well as the deflagration-to-detonation transition mechanism, independent of the spatial distribution of the mixtures in the channel. A recurring four-stage sequence of detonation initiation, detonation attenuation, initiation failure, and detonation reinitiation can be identified. When the mixtures generally have an intermediate degree of chemical reactivity, detonation combustion can be fully realized in the channel, where different overdrive degrees are found in the upper and lower halves. After the shutdown of the hot jet, the overdriven detonation attenuates gradually, and eventually a slightly overdriven detonation and a slightly underdriven detonation are generated, which can be regarded as a new stable state of propagation. However, whether a detonation can be initiated successfully is determined by the spatial mixture distribution. In mixtures with low degree of chemical reactivity, detonation initiation can generally not be realized. In this case, successful detonation initiation should be realizable by using of a stronger hot jet.",54,8

Until recently, combustion efficiency was measured using indirect approaches such as a one-dimensional control volume calculation or a calorimeter and wall pressure tap measurements. A novel nonintrusive direct approach for the measurement of combustion efficiency is presented that combines the optical diagnostic techniques tunable diode laser absorption tomography and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. Experimental results are presented for measurements of the University of Virginia’s Supersonic Combustion Facility in both the scram and ram-modes of operation. The tunable-diode-laser-absorption-tomography/stereoscopic-particle-image-velocimetry method directly measures the converted hydrogen (via water vapor) mass flow rate exiting the dual-mode scramjet and compares this to the facility-measured injected hydrogen fuel mass flow rate. A complementary computational fluid dynamics study was performed and results are available for the scram-mode operating condition. The results reported show excellent agreement between the tunable-diode-laser-absorption-tomography/stereoscopic-particle-image-velocimetry-measured combustion efficiency and the computational-fluid-dynamics-predicted combustion efficiency for the scram-mode of operation, which are both near 99%.

With the growing efficiency of analysis methods, coupled with growing computing power, such Monte Carlo methods, which were computationally impractical in the past, can now be used to simulate real flight vehicles at industry level of complexity and accuracy and allow statistical analysis of aeroservoelastic behavior on a scope and with depth not possible before. This paper describes the development of a new, fully integrated computational capability for Monte Carlo simulations of uncertain aeroservoelastic systems and presents results that add important insights regarding their reliability and overall uncertainty. The new capability allows selection of uncertain variables at all levels of modeling in all disciplines involved. As an important example, the focus of the work described here is the sensitivity to uncertainty of the “notch-filter” approach, commonly used to decouple aeroelastic and structural dynamic behavior and stabilize unfavorable aeroservoelastic interactions in cases where such interactions lead to instability.

The key reason for employing the stress-recovery procedure is its computational efficiency compared to three-dimensional finite element analyses. The developed procedure is applied to an example flat plate under the influence of dynamic loading. Results from the developed procedure are discussed; they compare well to those from a benchmark three-dimensional finite element solution.
