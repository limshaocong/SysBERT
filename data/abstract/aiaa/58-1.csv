1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058731,"A novel high-frequency flow control strategy for mitigation of dynamic stall is demonstrated for the case of a finite wing using high-fidelity wall-resolved implicit large-eddy simulations. A NACA 0012 wing of aspect ratio is considered at freestream Mach number and chord Reynolds number . The wing undergoes an oscillatory pitching motion with reduced frequency and maximum angle of attack , resulting in deep dynamic stall for the baseline case. Very-high-frequency spanwise uniform low-amplitude pulsed forcing is imparted through a zero-net mass flow blowing/suction slot located on the wing lower surface near the leading edge. The imposed small fluctuations are amplified by the laminar separation bubble (LSB) and inhibit LSB bursting and the formation of large-scale dynamic stall vortices. By maintaining effectively attached flow throughout the pitching cycle, actuation provides a significant reduction in the cycle-averaged drag and in the force and moment excursions. In addition, the negative (unstable) net-cycle pitch damping found in the baseline case is eliminated.",58,1

Surrogates are also widely used in dealing with uncertainty quantification of expensive black-box codes where there are strict limits on the number of function evaluations that can be afforded in estimating the statistical properties of derived performance quantities. This paper compares and contrasts a wide range of surrogate types on an aerodynamic section data set that allows for design variation, manufacturing uncertainty, and damage in service, all solved with a high-quality industrial-strength Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver. This paper examines speed of training and model quality for different sizes of problem up to one where there are 26 input variables and nearly half a million CFD results in the available data set.",58,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058291,"This study investigates the accuracy of deep learning models for the inference of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solutions. This study focuses on a modernized U-net architecture and evaluates a large number of trained neural networks with respect to their accuracy for the calculation of pressure and velocity distributions. In particular, it is illustrated how training data size and the number of weights influence the accuracy of the solutions. With the best models, this study arrives at a mean relative pressure and velocity error of less than 3% across a range of previously unseen airfoil shapes. In addition all source code is publicly available in order to ensure reproducibility and to provide a starting point for researchers interested in deep learning methods for physics problems. Although this work focuses on RANS solutions, the neural network architecture and learning setup are very generic, and applicable to a wide range of partial differential equation boundary value problems on Cartesian grids.",58,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058437,"General expressions are derived in this paper for the aerodynamic force and moment on an arbitrary set of pitching and heaving foils from the vortical impulse theory in the limit of linearized potential, two-dimensional flow. Of special interest for studying the propulsion of some aquatic and aerial animals and small unmanned vehicles is the case of two oscillating foils in an aligned tandem configuration, for which analytical explicit expressions for the lift, thrust, and moment are obtained. In the limit of large separation distance, the expressions of a single oscillating foil for the forewing are recovered, but the hindwing is always affected by the unsteady wake of the forewing in the present inviscid model. Relatively simple expressions are obtained in the cases of two heaving foils and of two pitching foils, for which the optimal conditions generating a maximum thrust force and a maximum propulsion efficiency are mapped in terms of the nondimensional separation distance, reduced frequency, and phase shift, and discussed physically in relation to the optimal results for a single oscillating foil. The present theoretical results are compared with available experimental and numerical data, with good agreement for small amplitude of the oscillations and sufficiently high Reynolds numbers.",58,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058598,"The unsteady flows past a NACA0015 airfoil near stall at a high Reynolds number are investigated numerically using the delayed detached-eddy simulation with adaptive coefficient model. The unsteady feature is primarily represented by a low-frequency oscillation, attributed to the quasi-period movement of the separation point. Correlation analysis between the instantaneous lift coefficient and separation point location indicates that the two signals present nearly in-phase behavior. Other unsteady characteristics such as the trailing-edge vortex shedding and instability of the upper surface shear layer are also analyzed. Since the Strouhal number corresponding to the movement of the separation point based on the projected airfoil height varies significantly with the angle of attack, the normalized Strouhal number based on the length of the recirculation region is observed to have a value of approximately 0.036 and be insensitive to the angle of attack.",58,1

Some localized pressure waves are induced by the discharge, propagating at a speed of about . A fairly weak vortex is also induced, with a maximum velocity of about . Wind tunnel experiments are conducted on a wing–body combination with a 47 deg swept wing. Three actuator arrangements are tested by force measurements. For the full leading-edge actuation, obvious changes of the normal forces can be achieved at high angles of attack before stall, when the actuator works at the optimum reduced frequency of . However, the stall angle is not delayed under the actuation. For front-half actuation at the leading edge, the obvious control effect is obtained at large angles of attack (22–30 deg), while for rear-half actuation, the normal force gets a relatively modest increase at a broad range of attack angles (10–34 deg). The flow pattern obtained by particle image velocimetry shows that the actuation frequency mainly determines the number of chordwise vortices coexisting along the shear layer. It is hard to engender the reattachment vortex over the wing under high-frequency actuations (such as ).",58,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058555,"This paper studies the similarities between the three-dimensional (3-D) cellular patterns that appear in conditions of transonic buffet and subsonic stall, using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. The geometries are obtained from the extrusion of a two-dimensional (2-D) airfoil with an added sweep angle, and periodic boundary conditions are imposed at both ends. First, numerical simulations of transonic buffet are performed. The numerical solutions exhibit three-dimensional cellular flow patterns, forming what has been named buffet cells. The latter are convected in the spanwise direction when a sweep angle is added, leading to the superposition of two frequencies. The first one is independent of the sweep angle and is characteristic of the two-dimensional buffet. The second one increases with the sweep angle and is related to the convection of the buffet cells. These cells are reminiscent of the stall cells, which are well known for low-speed flow conditions. Second, solutions of the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for infinite swept wings in stall conditions at low speed are computed, showing the same convection of the cellular patterns. These results indicate that the discrepancies between 2-D and 3-D buffet are caused by the appearance of stall cells, which are the same as buffet cells.",58,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058488,"The proposed passive control method, blade-end slots, is implemented to reorganize the blade-end flow in a highly loaded compressor cascade under a wide incidence range at . Both experimental and numerical investigations are conducted to validate the control effect and reveal the control mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively suppress the corner separation and broaden the effective operating range. The total pressure loss in the measurement plane is significantly reduced, ranging as high as 18.4, 20.6, 24.3, and 39.4% under the incidence angle of , 0°, 2° and 4°, respectively. Flow details indicate that the blade-end slots can generate self-adaptive high-momentum jet flows through the pressure difference between blade pressure and suction surface. The self-adaptive jet flow reenergizes the local low-momentum fluid to reduce separation, and restrain its migration toward midspan. The low-momentum flows near the endwall on the pressure side are aspirated, thus weakening the cross-passage migration of low-momentum endwall flow into suction surface corner. Proportion of unseparated regions in the blade midspan is enlarged; consequently, flow capacities are improved. The attachment at the blade-end regions is enhanced, and the insufficient circulation originally found at the blade extremity is improved.",58,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058513,"Dynamically extendable blade chord sections show promise for reducing helicopter rotor loads. A rotor model based on an elastic beam concept, and capable of predicting helicopter power, is used. A stiff in-plane four-bladed rotor with a shape similar to the UH-60A rotor is used as a baseline for comparisons. For the control of the 4/rev (per revolution) vertical hub force, it is not beneficial to actuate the extendable chord at hover and low-speed flight. At a high speed of , the extendable chord, with a width of 10% rotor radius and responded to an extension magnitude of 10% chord length, obtained a maximum force reduction of 89.4%. The magnitude of the dynamic chord needs to be optimized according to the flight state. The performance can be enhanced by increasing the extension or width of the dynamic chord. The dynamically extendable chord was not suitable for reducing the 2/rev blade flapwise root bending moment. However, a 3/rev dynamic chord extension showed great potential in reducing the 3/rev flapwise root bending moment and the 4/rev rotor rolling and pitching moments simultaneously. The effectiveness of a 5/rev dynamic chord in reducing the 4/rev rotor rolling or pitching moment degraded significantly as compared with a 3/rev actuation.",58,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058519,"This study experimentally investigated the effects of repetitive laser energy deposition using a supersonic intake model with a central conical compression surface and a cross-sectional duct in a Mach 1.92 indraft wind tunnel: especially in the subcritical and buzz modes. A single-pulse energy deposition was observed to suppress the flow separation at the compression surface by “sweeping” a shock wave system with the thermal bubble generated by the energy deposition. The duration of the sweeping effect was approximately in the subcritical mode and in the buzz mode. Furthermore, repetitive deposition of laser pulse energies was observed to moderate instabilities in both modes, and it increased the pressure recovery by as much as 8%; also, the occurrence of buzz was delayed, thereby widening the stable, subcritical regime. In both modes, there was a threshold value for the laser pulse repetition frequency , which corresponded to the duration of the sweeping effect (e.g., in subcritical mode). Below this frequency, the increase in the pressure was proportional to the repetition frequency; whereas above , the effect per single pulse was reduced.",58,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058266,"This paper investigates the method for predicting the laminar-to-turbulent transition in the context of hybrid laminar flow control. Transonic wind tunnel experiments are used to support our study. The relation between the discrete hole velocity in wind tunnel tests and the continuous surface velocity used in the simulation is established. With the calibrated relation, the method, consisting of a boundary-layer code and linear stability theory framework, has successfully predicted the transition location at various conditions, within 4% chord error compared with the experimental results. Additionally, the simulation profile drag by the integration of momentum loss method matches the results of the experimental wake rake, and the difference is within 1.85 counts. The simulation results show that the microsized wall suctioning reduces the amplitude of cross-flow velocity and lowers the inflection point in the boundary layer, hence suppressing the cross-flow vortices. Hence, the laminar-to-turbulent transition is pushed aft significantly. Meanwhile, the experimental and simulation results show that the wall blowing degrades the HLFC benefit, and it needs to be avoided in applications. This paper concludes that the method can be applied in the hybrid laminar flow control transition prediction with the given perforated panel properties.",58,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058556,"Turbulent planar mixing layers of varying compressibility levels have been studied experimentally via flow visualization techniques, pressure measurements, and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The experiments were conducted for five different convective Mach numbers (, 0.38, 0.55, 0.69, and 0.88). For each case, inflow conditions were thoroughly documented with planar particle image velocimetry. Results indicate that the incoming boundary layers are thin (less than or equal to 9% of channel height) and fully developed. Schlieren and Mie scattering images show that for increased levels of compressibility the large-scale turbulent structures are less organized, and the Brown–Roshko rollers that are dominant in the incompressible case are not found. Three-component velocity measurements made on the spanwise-central plane via stereo particle image velocimetry confirm the reduction in the normalized growth rate with increasing that has been agreed upon widely. Turbulence statistics results show that the peak (normalized) streamwise normal kinematic Reynolds stress remains constant, while the spanwise normal, transverse normal, and primary shear kinematic Reynolds stress peak values all decrease with increasing . In addition, knowledge of all three normal stress components allows for the calculation of the full Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor, a novel result for compressible mixing layer experiments. Each anisotropy component remains constant across the shear layer center. As compressibility in the mixing layer increases, the streamwise normal stress anisotropy increases, transverse and spanwise normal stress anisotropies decrease, and the shear stress anisotropy remains constant. Conversely, the Reynolds stress correlation coefficient remains constant across all cases at approximately 0.47.",58,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058302,"Strongly swirling flow is widely encountered in engineering applications. However, accurate prediction of the flow is still challenging for turbulence modeling. The present study reports the assessment and validation of a newly developed self-adaptive turbulence modeling, denoted as very-large-eddy simulation (VLES), for the prediction of turbulent strongly swirling flow through a suddenly expanding circular pipe at Reynolds number of and , and the corresponding swirl numbers are 1.16 and 1.23, which are both very strongly swirling flow. The VLES method is a unified simulation approach enabling a seamless evolution from Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) to LES and finally approaching direct numerical simulation (DNS) depending on the numerical resolution. In the present work, a new proposed VLES turbulence closure model, namely, VLES BSL , and other two models, denoted as VLES and VLES , are applied for the strong swirling flow simulation. Two meshes containing about 0.9 million and 5.1 million cells are applied, with different mesh resolutions. The simulation results are compared with available experimental data and RANS results. It is observed that the present VLES models accurately predict the time-averaged and root-mean-square (rms) velocities compared with the measurements on both of the two meshes. The significant features of the present strongly swirling flow, including vortex breakdown and the vortex core precession, large recirculation region, and shear-layer instability, are well captured by the present VLES models. Furthermore, the anisotropy of the Reynolds stresses of the strongly swirling flow is also well predicted. Satisfactory predictions can be obtained using low grid resolution with the VLES models, which confirm the validity and accuracy of the VLES modeling for strongly swirling turbulent flow.",58,1

A rotating antenna of aligned microphones has been used in previous studies, and the measured spectra are shown to be a convolution of the true spectra with the transfer function of said antenna. Deconvolution algorithms that were previously developed for other fields of studies are presented. Test cases and processing of experimental data are used to assess their applicability. A hybrid approach of both deconvolution and interpolation, to artificially refine the azimuthal discretization, is found to be best at estimating both narrowband and broadband components of the spectra.",58,1

The objective of the present study is to develop a two-layer PANS closure for improved near-wall simulation capability. In the RANS context, the two-layer turbulence model displays superior near-wall behavior compared with other closures of similar order. Our goal is to adapt these near-wall closure advantages to PANS-SRS model. In the outer region of the PANS two-layer closure, a PANS turbulence model is employed. In the inner layer, an unresolved kinetic energy equation is solved. The eddy viscosity and dissipation are specified using algebraic equations based on known scaling relationships. The proposed model is evaluated in a turbulent channel flow of friction Reynolds numbers in the range of . Comparison with DNS data demonstrates that two-layer PANS is potentially an accurate and robust SRS approach.",58,1

Over the past few years, they have shown promise in enabling implicit large-eddy simulations within the vicinity of complex geometrical configurations. However, the cost of such simulations remains prohibitive. In this paper, the impact of number representation on the efficiency and efficacy of these methods is considered. Theoretical performance models are derived and assessed. Specifically, four test cases are considered: 1) the viscous Taylor–Green vortex, 2) flow over a circular cylinder, 3) flow through a T106c low-pressure turbine cascade, and 4) flow around a NACA 0021 in deep stall. It is found that the use of single (in lieu of double) precision arithmetic does not have a significant impact on accuracy. The performance of the resulting simulations was found to improve between 1.4 and 2.9 times.",58,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058357,"This paper provides a novel approach for mesh generation for materials that have distinct spatial components with a smooth boundary between them. Experimental data are used in pixel/voxel format to label elements in a generic finite element (FE) mesh of a representative volume element. The basis of this approach is a novel Potts energy formulation to allow integer optimization on the dual of the FE mesh. The Potts energy can be decomposed into two terms: the field energy/data cost and the interaction energy/smoothing cost. The field term is used to represent the likelihood of a grain label on an element based on the experimental voxel data. The interaction term encodes a prior on this labeling; in particular, it is used for smoothening the phase boundary. Energy minimization of this system leads to a multiway cut problem, which is solved using graph cuts. A multilabel energy minimization problem is formulated using a Potts form. This methodology allows capturing smooth boundaries in materials with nonequiaxed morphologies. Applications to polycrystalline microstructures and woven composites are presented. The extension to nonequiaxed morphologies is presented using the Riemannian distance measure. This procedure allows re-usability of an FE mesh by adaptively assigning pixel/voxel information to elements while preserving important features like the phase boundary surface length/area.",58,1

An alternative approach using liner configurations retaining realistic mass and volume constraints and having innovative 3D folded core geometries is investigated to ascertain its low-frequency noise absorption performance. The relative performance of various candidate 3D folded core designs is compared using a metric termed the low-frequency performance (LFP) metric, which is derived from Zwikker-Kosten Transmission Line (ZKTL) theory–based numerical studies. An LFP-based software tool is developed to optimize packing of 3D folded cavities. Experimental verification of absorption coefficient spectra conducted using additively manufactured test articles in normal incidence acoustic impedance tubes yielded good correlation with simulations, verifying the feasibility of this approach. For an optimized design, more than 100 Hz of continuous bandwidth with an absorption coefficient greater than 0.6 is shown to be possible in the 250–400 Hz range with a liner 38.1 mm (1.5 in.) thick. With current additive and hybrid manufacturing techniques attaining critical commercial maturity, 3D folded cavity liners could provide a promising practical solution to mitigate low-frequency airborne noise, especially in aerospace applications.",58,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058036,A computational study is presented of the nonlinear combustion instability of a multi-injector rocket engine. The study addresses a choked nozzle and a combustion chamber with 10 and 19 coaxial injector ports. Computations using a three-dimensional unsteady shear-stress transport delayed detached-eddy simulation method provide detailed time-resolved information about the combustion instability. The spontaneous longitudinal-mode instability is observed for the 10- and 19-injector geometries with a combustion-chamber diameter of 28 cm. The triggered tangential and longitudinal instability modes are obtained for the 19-injector geometry with a combustion-chamber diameter of 43 cm by pulsing the injector mass flux. It is shown that an oscillating combustion-chamber flow can be triggered to a new mode with a larger disturbance amplitude. The streamwise vorticity created by the instability impacts the heat release in a manner that supports the instability. A preliminary study of injector-size scaling effects is performed by comparison of the 10- and 19-injector combustors.,58,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058460,"A simplified formulation, based on treating the ratio of the heat release to the postshock thermal enthalpy as a small parameter, accommodating arbitrary chemistry descriptions, is shown to reproduce computationally the same variety of phenomena as more complex formulations for oblique detonations with supersonic postshock flow. The resulting small relative variations of velocity and thermodynamic properties across the reaction region are described by linearized Euler equations written in characteristic form, supplemented by the linearized Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions across the leading shock. The simplified formulation is used to analyze the interaction of the oblique detonation with a weak vortex sheet, for an Arrhenius irreversible reaction with an activation energy large compared with the postshock thermal enthalpy. The analysis reveals that, as , the product of the activation energy and the heat release divided by the square of the postshock thermal enthalpy, increases through values of order unity, decaying spatial oscillations, found for small values, are replaced by persistent nonlinear oscillations of finite amplitude for larger values. Beyond a critical value of the growth of the oscillation amplitude leads to the development of a singularity at the shock, an explosion, consistent with the formation of a triple point. Many related problems can be clarified with this formulation.",58,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058707,"A plate sinking in supersonic flow rapidly with pure acceleration was shown recently to have a flow structure and force behavior similar to those caused by a large-amplitude step motion, and this force evolution can be predicted by a nonlinear weighted Duhamel integral integrating a nonlinear solution due to large-amplitude forward step motions. In this paper, this previous study is extended to a more complex case, in which the plate sinks in supersonic flow with acceleration in the first stage and deceleration in the second stage, and stops sinking in the last stage. The flow structures are clarified numerically for each stage, according to whether the sinking is slow or fast compared to the horizontal wave speed, and the force-evolution behavior is displayed and related to the flow structures. It was found that a residual force exists during the motionless stage for fast sinking, due to the historical effect of wave evolution. In addition, although the nonlinear weighted Duhamel method predicts the force well for the first and second stages, it performs less well than a linear force method for the third stage, showing that a force method based on the forward step-motion model should be revised in the future.",58,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058564,"The concept of the generalized hypersonic equivalence principle for viscous flows is proposed in this paper. The traditional hypersonic equivalence principle applies only to the inviscid flows and pressure prediction. The present generalized principle indicates that the skin friction and the heat flux resulting from a steady viscous flow over a slender body could also be approximately analogous to the counterparts in an equivalent unsteady flow in one less space dimension. The key point is that the hypersonic velocity component perpendicular to the reduced unsteady flow plane should be retained and its evolution with time be properly treated to produce strong shear and dissipation effects. The generalized principle is specifically implemented by using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method to study the fundamental boundary-layer flow models and a practical complex viscous-interaction flow over a typical vehicle model. The results of the pressure, skin friction, and heat flux from the steady flows and the corresponding reduced unsteady flows are compared and analyzed. This study points out an inherent similarity between the hypersonic steady flow and the dimension-reduced unsteady flow, and also shows a potential application value in the engineering practice.",58,1

Starting from the original assumptions of Vincenti and Kruger (Introduction to Physical Gas Dynamics, Wiley, New York, 1965) and through the elaboration of a mathematical framework relying on a specific modeling hierarchy of balance equations for the moles of different species involved, it is shown that the extension of the frozen sonic flow method (FSFM) to the case of polyatomic molecules can be made well posed. Dedicated experiments have been conducted using a reentry simulation facility and varying the mass-averaged enthalpy in the range between 5 and . In particular, three different gas mixtures have been considered (using nitrogen as a hot feeding gas and adding cold oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane, respectively). The enthalpy ratios calculated by the FSFM, which were found to depend on the gas mixture, have been compared with the values determined using two alternate techniques, namely, 1) the heating rate method and 2) the calorimetric probe method. Given the extremely complex experimental conditions considered (high-enthalpy, low density, and supersonic reactive flows), the agreement between the theoretical and experimental results can be considered very satisfactory.",58,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058543,"The interplay of a gas–surface interaction and thermal nonequilibrium is still an open problem in aerothermodynamics. In the case of reusable thermal protection systems, it is unclear how much of the recombination energy is stored internally in the molecules produced by surface catalytic reactions, potentially leading to nonequilibrium between their translational and internal energy modes. A methodology is developed to calculate the energy accommodation coefficient using a rovibrational state-to-state chemical mechanism for a nitrogen mixture coupled with a generalized form of the catalytic recombination coefficient. The flow around a spherical body is simulated in hypersonic conditions, allowing study of the amount of energy deposited on the surface and stored in the recombining molecules. Internal energy quenching into translational energy is found, which is a phenomenon also observed experimentally, keeping the total energy transferred to the surface overall constant. The methodology developed for the application of a state-to-state model in the computational fluid dynamics framework coupled with catalysis is generic and applicable to a variety of other similar mechanisms.",58,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058607,"In this study, a simple model was developed to describe the mechanism behind a nonintrusive method that uses air glow discharge to simultaneously measure the gas density and temperature in low-density, short-duration hypersonic facilities. The developed model revealed that the emission intensity of the second positive band system of nitrogen molecules varies linearly with the gas density, which was firmly supported by spectroscopic observations characterizing the glow spectra. A laminar separated boundary layer was visually distinguishable via variations in the emission color reflected on a uniform positive column, along which traverse measurements were performed using miniature spectrometers. The experimental spectra agreed fairly well with synthetic ones calculated by substituting gas temperature distribution determined from computational fluid dynamics. In contrast, the temperature was not found to be a crucial factor determining the emission color distribution. The color was instead found to vary with the ratio of the emission intensity of the first positive band system to that of the second one. The principle of the variation in emission color implies that the mechanism explaining the variation will be more complex than what is assumed in existing models.",58,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058405,"The double swept waverider is a classic example of the planform-customized osculating-cone waveriders, delivering satisfactory performances over a wide range of velocities. The nonlinear increase in the lift of double swept waveriders at high angles of attack is of vital interest. In this paper, the aerodynamic performance of the double swept waverider is calculated and compared with single swept waveriders. The results suggest that the nonlinear increase in the lift of the double swept waverider is stronger than that of the equal-planform-area single swept waverider, and it increases with the Mach number. Some scholars have proposed the “vortex lift” to explain the nonlinear increase in lift, but it is controversial because the main lift of the waverider comes from the lower rather than the upper surface. This paper proposes that this nonlinear increase is related to the attachment of the shock wave influenced by the leading-edge sweep angle. The shock wave is more inclined to attach under the lower surface at a smaller sweep angle than a larger one as the angle of attack increases. When the shock wave attaches, the increase in pressure via the angle of attack is nonlinear, leading to a nonlinear increase in lift. When the shock wave detaches, the increase in lift is approximately linear.",58,1
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058689,"In this paper, a novel gas-kinetic harmonic balance method (HBM) is developed for unsteady flows with oscillating motions. Particularly, the emphasis here is on supersonic and hypersonic flows. Because of the presence of an additional source term in the harmonic balance equations, usually very small time steps are needed for explicit algorithms, and some factorization-based implicit algorithms may fail to converge in the case of higher frequencies. To achieve better convergence performance and robustness, a Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov method is adopted. By constructing a simplified preconditioning matrix, the lower–upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel scheme is employed as a preconditioner, so that the computational cost and memory requirement can be reduced. Considering that conventional spatial discretization schemes may encounter numerical difficulties and low robustness in high-Mach-number flows, a more general gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) is extended for the harmonic balance equations. As the HBM solves a mathematically steady problem, the present GKS focuses on evaluation of the time-independent fluxes at each cell interface and each subtime level. The gas-kinetic HBM is applied to a supersonic oscillating flat plate cascade and an oscillating panel in hypersonic flow. By comparison with other methods, the advantages of the developed method are demonstrated.",58,1
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058470,"A new surrogate modeling approach is developed that augments the loads from an analysis over an undeformed surface in order to account for the effects of static surface deformations in high-speed flows. The approach relies on pointwise data-driven surrogates to approximate the nonlinear flow mechanics and theoretical expressions to identify the surrogate input parameters. The pointwise nature of the model enables efficient construction with minimal assumptions on the surface deformation. The accuracy of the modeling strategy is evaluated relative to steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes analyses for prescribed deformations and quasi-static aerothermoelastic response prediction. Basic fluid loads models and conventional kriging interpolation models, where deformation is parameterized using global characteristic shapes, are also considered. The new surrogate approach yields normalized root mean square errors of less than 5% relative to steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes predictions of pressure and heat flux over prescribed deformations. Results for aerothermoelastic simulations highlight that the approach outperforms all other models in terms of predicting the thermo-structural response and fluid loads. In regard to computational requirements, the new approach affords a 93% reduction in the offline costs compared with conventional kriging models and is several orders of magnitude faster than Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations for online predictions.",58,1
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058514,"A study is conducted to evaluate four derivative estimation methods when solving a large sparse nonlinear programming problem that arises from the approximation of an optimal control problem using a direct collocation method. In particular, the Taylor series-based finite difference, bicomplex-step, and hyper-dual derivative estimation methods are evaluated and compared alongside a well-known automatic differentiation method. The performance of each derivative estimation method is assessed based on the number of iterations, the computation time per iteration, and the total computation time required to solve the nonlinear programming problem. The efficiency of each of the four derivative estimation methods is compared by solving three benchmark optimal control problems. It is found that, although central finite differencing is typically more efficient per iteration than either the hyper-dual or the bicomplex-step method, the latter two methods have significantly lower overall computation times due to the fact that fewer iterations are required by the nonlinear programming problem when compared with central finite differencing. Furthermore, although the bicomplex-step and hyper-dual methods are similar in performance, the hyper-dual method is significantly easier to implement. Moreover, the automatic differentiation method is found to be substantially less computationally efficient than any of the three Taylor series-based methods. The results of this study show that the hyper-dual method offers several benefits over the other three methods: both in terms of computational efficiency and ease of implementation.",58,1

To show the effect of the fractional derivative on nonlocality, the frequency spectra of the plates with different boundary conditions and symmetry modes are carried out for the different orders of the fractional derivative and different values of the length scale parameter . The vibration analysis is obtained by the Ritz energy method, whereas Chebyshev polynomials are used as admissible functions. The results of the frequency spectrum demonstrate that the nonlocal effect decreases and the results get closer to the values of the classical frequencies as the order of the fractional derivative approaches the classical derivative .",58,1
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058593,"This paper presents the development of an aeroelastic analysis formulation for the dynamic response of a flexible wing. The geometrically nonlinear structure is represented by a reduced-order model that accounts for the large-deformation effects on the inertia and stiffness terms. It is based on a system identification of a built-up finite element model and does not rely on a geometric nonlinear beam-based model as most of the state-of-the-art nonlinear aeroelastic frameworks do. The complexity of the wing structural layout is captured in the built-up finite element model as in traditional industry applications. To preserve a small number of states to represent the structural dynamics of the system, a modal approach is used in a nonlinear sense. Moreover, this approach is easily linked to computational fluid dynamics. For this study, the structural reduced-order model framework is integrated within the aeroelastic framework of the code CFL3D. Using this integrated solution, the aeroelastic response of a high-aspect-ratio wing is investigated.",58,1
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058418,"This paper answers the question raised in the title of this paper and shows that it is not true for systems in which the damping matrix is indefinite. It introduces a new paradigm in the theory of linear stability that gyroscopically stabilized unstable potential systems can be made stable, and even exponentially stable, by the addition of linear damping. Conceptually, the paper also points to a practical methodology for adding damping to such gyroscopically stabilized potential systems to render them exponentially stable. The methodology involves the simultaneous use of both dissipative damping or negative velocity feedback, and positive velocity feedback. The methodology is illustrated in detail on two-degree-of-freedom gyroscopically stabilized potential systems. In-depth stability analysis of such systems is provided. It is shown that they can always be made exponentially stable by using an uncountably infinite number of appropriate indefinite damping matrices. A connected region is proved to exist in the space of indefinite damping matrices for which such damped gyroscopically stabilized systems are guaranteed to be exponentially stable, and this region of exponential stability is analytically delineated. Numerical studies are provided to corroborate the analytical results.",58,1
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058118,"A general formulation is presented to linear multipoint constraints, underlying that the linkages of mechanical system dynamics are governed by kinematic constraint conditions. Both rigid and interpolated multipoint constraints are then described in a formulation based on the Lagrange multiplier adjunction. The proposed formulation can directly offer reaction forces, which are essential information to modeling linkages of mechanical components. In particular, in the interpolated multipoint constraints, the proposed formulation is more numerically stable than the conventional master–slave formulation that has invertible issues with respect to choice of the constraint nodes. The other aim of the work is to condense the original equations of motion into degrees of freedom at certain nodes only, named as condensation nodes, for better computational and modeling efficiencies. In the proposed Lagrange multiplier based formulation, accuracy of the reduced model can be improved by dynamic correction. The performance of the proposed method is theoretically evaluated by comparing the master–slave elimination, which is the most widely used approach of the multipoint constraints, and it is demonstrated through numerical examples.",58,1
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058561,"A new mixed-boundary model reduction technique is presented for nonlinear forced response analysis of mistuned bladed disks with shroud friction contacts. In contrast to conventional fixed- or free-mode component mode synthesis (CMS) techniques, blades are reduced in a mixed-boundary fashion. Accordingly, blade component normal modes with a more realistic mixed boundary condition (fixed at blade-disk interface and free at shroud contacts) are incorporated into the reduction basis. Afterward a modal synthesis based on loaded interface modeshapes of the disk is performed to reduce the disk component and the previously retained blade-disk interface degrees of freedom (DOFs). This results in a compact reduced order model (ROM) in which retained physical DOFs contain only shroud contact nodes. During the reduction steps, sector-level frequency mistuning is efficiently introduced into the ROM. In addition, the reduction basis is invariant of the mistuning pattern, which makes the ROM suitable for statistical characterization of nonlinear response levels. The final ROM is computed using one single sector only and with minimal computational effort. Numerical simulations revealed an improved accuracy of the ROM based on the mixed-boundary model in predicting the nonlinear forced response levels of a mistuned bladed disk with shroud friction contacts.",58,1
35,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058645,"In this paper, an enhanced response sensitivity approach is proposed for parameter identification of nonlinear time-delay aeroelastic systems. Two common aeroelastic models are investigated, namely, the aeroelastic system under the unsteady Theodorsen aerodynamic forces and the airfoil-store system under the steady incompressible flow. The work of this paper is mainly threefold. First, the motion equations of two aeroelastic models including time-delay signals are derived, and the response sensitivity analysis with respect to the system parameters is conducted. Then, parameter identification is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares problem, and the enhanced response sensitivity approach is developed to get the solution. Finally, numerical examples are studied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal that the proposed approach can give accurate, robust, and efficient identification of the parameters for time-delay aeroelastic systems.",58,1
36,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058529,"This study aims to develop a linear nonintrusive reduced-order model (NIROM) for facilitating combined fast parametric analysis and reconstruction of unsteady aerodynamic flow variables by using a novel signal interpolation approach, which is combined with a subspace-identification-based method. The NIROM is then applied to airfoil flutter and gust interaction problems where the assumption of linearized dynamics gives reasonably accurate estimates. In the traditional subspace-identification method, the training datasets of force coefficient signals corresponding to each flow parameter (like the Mach number and angle of attack) are required to generate the linear time-invariant system. The generation of the training signal for each flow parameter is the most computationally expensive process in any parametric reduced-order model (ROM). In the present work, the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) combined with the radial basis function (RBF) method is used for the interpolation of training signals at a specific flow parameter to reduce the overall computational cost. The conventional nonintrusive approaches are generally constrained by the number of output channels, and hence not suitable for the reconstruction of unsteady surface force distribution or flowfield variables. A few suitable sensor locations using the DEIM are selected as output channels of the subspace-identification method to realize the full datasets of surface force distribution over the airfoil. Finally, a suitable algorithmic structure is proposed to achieve unsteady distributive flow-variable reconstruction and parametric variation simultaneously. The current signal interpolation-based NIROM is applied to a wing section with two- and four-degree-of-freedom structural motions.",58,1
37,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058600,"Flow-induced flutter of elastic membranes has many applications in engineering, biology, and medicine; and recent advances in computational modeling are enabling the simulation of such problems in unprecedented detail. However, appropriate experiments that would allow comprehensive validation of such models are lacking. To fill this gap, low-Reynolds-number experiments were conducted on the flow-induced flutter of a suspended elastic membrane. This configuration has well-defined boundary conditions and exhibits a variety of flutter regimes, thereby making it a suitable case for validation. Silicon sheets of three different thicknesses are used as the material for the suspended membrane, and the other key variables in the study are the flow speed and the yaw angle of the membrane. The deflection and flutter motion of each membrane is measured using a high-speed imaging system. A variety of flutter regimes are observed for the parameters studied here, including nominally two-dimensional flutter as well as highly three-dimensional motion for nonzero yaw angles. Qualitative as well as quantitative features of the flutter are cataloged in order to provide a comprehensive dataset for validation.",58,1
38,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058465,"An approach based on the cohesive zone model for analyzing delamination in composite laminates under cyclic fatigue loading is presented. The proposed technique, called “min-max load approach,” is able to dynamically capture the local stress ratio during the progression of delamination. The possibility to know the local stress ratio is relevant in all the situations where its value is different from the applied load ratio and cannot be determined a priori. The methodology analyzes in a single finite element analysis two identical models with two different constant loads, the minimum and the maximum load of the fatigue cycle. The two models interact with each other, exchanging information to calculate the crack growth rate. At first, the approach has been validated in simulations of mode I and mixed-mode propagation using double cantilever beam and mixed-mode bending tests. Then, to prove the effectiveness of the developed methodology, a modified version of the mixed-mode bending test has been analyzed. Mode I and mode II components of the load are decoupled and applied independently, resulting in a local stress ratio different from the applied load ratio. The results obtained from the simulations, compared with the analytical model obtained using the corrected beam theory, show that the proposed approach is able to predict the local stress ratio and thereby to correctly evaluate the crack growth rate during the propagation of the damage.",58,1
39,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058384,"When a high-velocity projectile impacts a fluid-filled structure, hydrodynamic ram occurs from the overpressure caused by the transfer of energy and momentum from the projectile to the fluid, often with catastrophic effects. The critical damage is usually located at the seams/joints of said enclosure. A RamGun can be used as a less expensive alternative for assessing joint resistance to hydrodynamic ram. Numerical techniques are regularly used to supplement testing and to predict hydrodynamic ram damage in structures. This study was used to evaluate the viability of using a coarse mesh cohesive zone modeling technique to model a bonded joint in concert with LS-DYNA arbitrary Lagrangian–Euler fluid structure interaction algorithm to ascertain the joint resistance to hydrodynamic ram pressures generated in a RamGun. The ballistic testing approach was used to determine the failure pressure range for a joint that was used to calibrate the numerical model. The calibrated coarse mesh was able to predict joint failure in line with the test pressure values and also captured failure modes for various coupons of varying skin thicknesses. This will serve as a baseline for modeling and assessing joint failure in larger structures like fuel tanks and storage containers subjected to hydrodynamic ram.",58,1
