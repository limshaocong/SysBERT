The analytical method is general and can be applied to any higher-fidelity computational method such as free-wake methods or computational fluid dynamics analyses. In this work, the higher-order free-wake method WindDVE is used to compute tip-vortex rollup and wake expansion in the near wake of a highly loaded wind-turbine rotor. The resulting spanwise distributions of the blade flow angle serve as input to the analytical method that is subsequently tested for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory phase 6 rotor by implementing a corrected tip-loss factor into the blade-element code XTurb. It is found that a simple modification can be added to the classical tip-loss factor in blade-element momentum theory that leads to improved prediction of blade tip loads at no additional computational expense.",55,2

Inducing streaky base flows can suppress the growth of unsteady disturbances that would otherwise incite laminar-to-turbulent transition. Previous experimental and numerical works demonstrated the versatility of these miniature vortex generators in zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers. In this work, mean-flow disturbances developing from miniature vortex generators in adverse and favorable pressure-gradient boundary layers are measured systemically to assess the possibility of extending miniature vortex generator-based flow control to these scenarios. Boundary-layer streak amplitudes are measured across a range of Falkner–Skan values, and an empirical scaling is found based on existing results. The effect of streaks on transition in an adverse pressure-gradient boundary layer is also tested, and moderate increases to laminar flow extents are observed.",55,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055223,"The performance of active flow control on a NACA laminar airfoil at a poststall angle of attack of 20 deg is evaluated using discrete, wall-normal pulsed jets. The chord Reynolds number is 64,000, and actuation is implemented near the leading edge of the airfoil. For actuation periods equal to one convective period and two convective periods, the average lift coefficient increases monotonically as the actuation duty cycle is reduced, for a given blowing ratio. Flow reattachment is achieved following the termination of a short duration pulse, and the reattachment point propagates toward the trailing edge at a rate three times slower than the convective period of the flow. Extended jet off times can cause full separation to reoccur, should the reattachment point reach the trailing edge; however, optimal jet off times can cause suction pressure to extend over much of the airfoil chord. Higher duty cycle actuation results in a phase shift of the dynamics that appears to be commensurate with the duration of the jet. A disturbance initiated by the termination of the jet causes a delay in the redevelopment of the shear layer and the reattachment of the flow, prohibiting high lift values from being attained.",55,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054888,"This paper is a numerical investigation on model reduction and control system design of integrally actuated membrane wings. A high-fidelity electroaeromechanical model is used for the simulation of the dynamic fluid–structure interaction between a low-Reynolds-number flow and a dielectric elastomeric wing. Two reduced-order models with different levels of complexity are then derived. They are based on the projection of the full-order discretization of fluid and structure on modal shapes obtained from eigenvalue analysis and proper orthogonal decomposition. The low-order systems are then used for the design of proportional–integral–derivative and linear–quadratic–Gaussian feedback schemes to control wing lift. When implemented in the full-order model, closed-loop dynamics are in very good agreement with the reduced-order model for both tracking and gust rejection, demonstrating the suitability of the approach. The control laws selected in this work were found to be effective only for low-frequency disturbances due to the large phase delay introduced by the fluid convective time scales, but results demonstrate the potential for the aerodynamic control of membrane wings in outdoor flight using dielectric elastomers.",55,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054880,"This study focuses on the flow field of a round synthetic jet issuing into a crossflow. Six cases are investigated in which the jet-to-freestream velocity ratios range between 2.8 and 8.3. This corresponds to a medium-to-strong transverse jet, which is characterized using both two-dimensional hot-wire anemometry and particle image velocimetry techniques. A self-similar model is developed for the centerline trajectory and velocity of a transverse synthetic jet. The resulting scaling laws are validated with experimental data. The scaling coefficients are found to be independent of the synthetic jet strength (characterized by the stroke ratio) for large-velocity-ratio cases, provided that the jet velocity is calculated based on the momentum flux of the leading vortex ring of the synthetic jet. Furthermore, the velocity component parallel to the crossflow is enhanced over the crossflow velocity in the near field and fundamentally different from continuous jets. This can be explained by the induced effect of the asymmetric vortex rings in the near field, which are a result of the interaction between the crossflow and the synthetic jet.",55,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054937,"Wind-tunnel experiments were conducted on two symmetric airfoils with different thickness ratios as a test of the ability of Goman–Khrabrov-type models to predict the lift coefficient history during pitching maneuvers. The primary difference between the two airfoils was that the thin airfoil had no hysteresis in its lift curve during quasi-steady maneuvers, but static hysteresis was observed with the thick airfoil over a range of . Both airfoils exhibited dynamic hysteresis in the lift coefficient when the wing was pitching. The existence of static hysteresis had a strong effect on the lift response during periodic pitching and must be accounted for in the model. A modified version of the Goman–Khrabrov model was introduced that captured the static hysteresis behavior and the large-scale features of the dynamic hysteresis for the thick airfoil, even when the thick airfoil was in a deep-stall condition. Some deviations between model and experiment were observed at the highest angles of attack, which were attributed to the convection of the dynamic stall vortex and its backwash effect as it leaves the airfoil.",55,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055267,"Energy harvesting using flapping foils has attracted significant attention in the last 10 years. In contrast to conventional turbines, which rely on attached flow for high efficiency, a flapping-foil turbine exploits the separation of fluid flow near the nose of the foil to form a leading-edge vortex, resulting in high instantaneous forces. To reduce the computational cost of simulating a flapping foil undergoing high angles of attack (up to 90 deg), a discrete vortex method that incorporates leading-edge flow separation is used in this study. Corrections using semi-empirical functions are introduced to account for the effects of trailing-edge flow separation. Instantaneous lift and power coefficient as well as the mean power coefficient and efficiency from the discrete vortex method with separation corrections are compared against those from a dynamic stall model and computational-fluid-dynamics results obtained by the lattice Boltzmann method. The discrete vortex method provides better agreement with computational-fluid-dynamics simulations compared to the dynamic stall model.",55,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055120,"Empirical mode decomposition has been shown to be a valuable data analysis tool in a wide array of technical fields, and it has recently emerged as a useful technique for studying complex fluid flows. This technique is useful for separating relevant unsteady spatiotemporal scales from a signal through an adaptive, iterative data-processing algorithm. Traditionally, empirical mode decomposition has been used to study time-dependent single-dimensional signals, though it can also be useful for studying multidimensional flowfield data. For the current study, unsteady velocity measurements were acquired across the initial development region of a turbulent-plane mixing layer using time-resolved particle image velocimetry. Empirical mode decomposition was applied to the resulting velocity field measurements to decompose the flowfield into several unsteady modes. Single-dimensional empirical mode decomposition was used to understand the time-frequency behavior of the flow associated with the formation and pairing process of large-scale vortical structures. The resulting spectrogram clearly displayed a periodic influence of large-scale vortex structures produced by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, which also exhibited a phase relationship with the vortex pairing mechanism. A multidimensional empirical mode decomposition analysis was also conducted, which allowed the unsteady velocity field to be decomposed into scale-based modes with dependence on , , and dimensions. This analysis allowed the influence of small-scale turbulent structures within the flowfield to be separated from those associated with large-scale vortical structures produced by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability.",55,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055050,"A novel algorithm was developed to estimate scene depth by uniquely exploiting plenoptic image data. Plenoptic images allow multiple perspectives to be extracted from a single exposure from a single lens. Depth from disparity was calculated for every available perspective view using normalized cross correlation. This resulted in a large number of unique disparity maps, which were then combined in a least-squares sense, weighted by confidence coefficients to account for measurement uncertainty. The averaged disparity map was then transformed into a depth map using geometric optics. The accuracy of the algorithm was tested with a plenoptic camera on a small static target imaged throughout the depth of field. Depth was recovered with a standard deviation less than 5 mm, validating the algorithm.",55,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055199,"Entropy waves are an important source of indirect combustion noise and potentially contribute to the generation of thermoacoustic instabilities in gas-turbine combustors. Entropy fluctuations generated by unsteady combustion are known to disperse and diffuse as they convect toward the combustor exit. In this work, the propagation of entropy waves is investigated by means of experiments in a newly developed entropy rig and numerical simulations based on the large-eddy simulation approach. Both experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the amplitude of entropy fluctuations decays as a function of wave parameters and propagation distance, and it scales well with a local Helmholtz number . A new theoretical model for the computation of the entropy transfer function suitable for inclusion in low-order models for combustion instabilities is proposed. Assessment against numerical and experimental results shows the capability of the model to give a proper representation of the decay of entropy waves in terms of both magnitude and phase of the entropy transfer function. Furthermore, by comparison with the large-eddy simulation results, it is shown that, at low Helmholtz numbers, the contribution of the differential convection to the decay of entropy waves is dominant; whereas for high values of the Helmholtz number, the turbulent mixing and diffusion also become important.",55,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055278,"Implicit large-eddy simulation studies of low-speed circular cylinder flows at subcritical Reynolds numbers of both 2580 and 3900 are conducted. Focus is placed on the controversial profile shape of the streamwise velocity around one diameter downstream from the cylinder. The minimum dispersion and controllable dissipation scheme is employed for the reconstruction and the simple low-dissipation AUSM scheme is used as the Riemann solver. The combined numerical method performs well in the implicit large-eddy simulation of the separated flows. With the numerical method’s feature of controllable dissipation, the nonmonotonic effect of the numerical dissipation on the predicted length of the recirculation bubble is studied and explained. When the numerical scheme is excessively dissipative, the increasing of dissipation tends to turn the flow into laminar vortex shedding, leading to a greatly underestimated recirculation bubble and a V-shape profile. However, when the numerical dissipation is small, its mechanism of suppressing the perturbations magnified by the numerical dispersion will become important. Increasing the dissipation will then increase the predicted recirculation size by delaying the shear-layer transition and tends to show a U-shape profile result. For implicit large-eddy simulation, the dispersion should be minimized and the dissipation should be controlled to an appropriate level.",55,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055058,"The effect of the sliding friction has been important in calculating the heat flux of gas flow from the surface because there is some slip over the surface. There is not any temperature jump condition including the sliding friction part (viscous heat generation) in its derivation so far. In this paper, the Smoluchowski temperature jump condition is modified by considering viscous heat generation. This new temperature jump condition will be evaluated for three configurations in high-speed rarefied gas flow simulations using the computational fluid dynamics method, which solves the Navier–Stokes equations within the OpenFOAM framework: 1) the flat plate, with Mach number 2) the NACA0012 microairfoil, with Mach number ; and 3) the sharp 25–55 deg biconic case, with Mach number . The working gases are air and nitrogen. The airfoil case is simulated with various Knudsen numbers from 0.026 to 0.26, and the angles of attack are from 10 to 20 deg. The surface gas temperatures predicted by the new temperature jump condition give good agreement with the direct simulation Monte Carlo data, especially the NACA0012 microairfoil cases with the high Knudsen numbers ( and ) with an angle of attack of 20 deg.",55,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055061,"This paper presents new methodologies based on Mack’s amplitude method to estimate the start of transition in hypersonic wind tunnels when the second mode dominates the transition process. The methodologies rely on linear stability computations, measured or modeled tunnel noise, and experimentally determined second-mode breakdown amplitude and receptivity correlations. The first technique uses the measured pitot pressure fluctuations and correlations for the receptivity coefficient to estimate the initial amplitudes. The second technique replaces pitot pressure measurements with a freestream noise spectral amplitude model based on the parameters found in Pate’s correlation. The rationale behind this new model and new insight into Pate’s correlation are provided. The methods can successfully correlate Tunnel 9 and Tunnel F cone measurements at Mach numbers between 9 and 10, unit Reynolds numbers between 1.8 and 30 million per meter, and nose-tip radii between 1.5 and 12.7 mm. The standard error between the measured and predicted start of transition is approximately 14%, which corresponds to or 4% of the cone length. In comparison, predictions based on a constant transition factor yield a standard error greater than 40% and fail to predict transition in several cases.",55,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055220,"Laminar separation on the aftbody of an adiabatic circular cylinder was numerically investigated over a range of freestream Mach and Reynolds numbers using the free open-source program OpenFOAM. Simulations were performed assuming laminar, continuum, thermally perfect flow of nitrogen gas. Simulation predictions have been compared to various empirical correlations in the literature. Empirical formulations were presented for the pressure minimum location, separation location, and separation length on the cylinder aftbody. The effects of both Mach and Reynolds numbers on the separation location were examined by correcting for the change in viscosity across the shock wave. This was accounted for explicitly in the presented empirical formulations by deriving an expression for the viscosity change across the shock. A free-interaction theory was used to examine the wall-pressure distribution due to lip-shock formation on the aftbody. Over a range of Mach and Reynolds numbers, it was found that the profile of a free-interaction parameter was predictable and nearly Reynolds number and Mach number independent. This free-interaction parameter was a correlation between the properties at the onset of the interaction and the ensuing pressure rise. This provided a means to predict the lip-shock formation, provided the boundary-layer properties at the pressure minimum were known.",55,2

The performed large-eddy simulation has demonstrated good agreement with experimental data in terms of mean flowfield structures, surface pressure distribution, and surface flow pattern. Furthermore, the shock wave system, flow separation structure, and turbulence characteristics were all investigated by analyzing the obtained large-eddy simulation dataset. It was found that, for this kind of three-dimensional shock wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interaction problem, the flow characteristics in different regions have been dominated by respective wall turbulence, free shear layer turbulence, and corner vortex motions in different regions. In the reverse flow region, near-wall quasi-streamwise streaky structures were observed just beneath the main separation vortex, indicating that the transition of the pathway of the separation flow to turbulence may occur within a short distance from the reattachment location. The obtained large-eddy simulation results have provided a clear and direct evidence of the primary reverse flow and the secondary separation flow being essentially turbulent.",55,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055257,"Steady-state and scale-resolving simulations have been performed for flow in and around a model scramjet combustor flameholder. The cases simulated corresponded to those used to examine this flowfield experimentally using particle image velocimetry. A variety of turbulence models were used for the steady-state Reynolds-averaged simulations, which included both linear and nonlinear eddy viscosity models. The scale-resolving simulations used a hybrid Reynolds-averaged/large-eddy simulation strategy that is designed to be a large-eddy simulation everywhere except in the inner portion (log layer and below) of the boundary layer. Hence, this formulation can be regarded as a wall-modeled large-eddy simulation. This effort was undertaken to formally assess the performance of the hybrid Reynolds-averaged/large-eddy simulation modeling approach in a flowfield of interest to the scramjet research community. The numerical errors were quantified for both the steady-state and scale-resolving simulations before making any claims of predictive accuracy relative to the measurements. The hybrid Reynolds-averaged/large-eddy simulation results were also carefully scrutinized to ensure that even the coarsest grid had an acceptable level of resolution to meet accepted guidelines for large-eddy simulation and that the time-averaged statistics were acceptably accurate. The autocorrelation and its Fourier transform were the primary tools used for this assessment. Both simulation strategies accurately predicted the mean streamwise velocity distribution within the cavity, although the Reynolds-averaged simulations that used a linear eddy viscosity model tended to overpredict the strength of the primary cavity recirculation zone. Second-order moments of the velocity field were found to be highly sensitive to the turbulence model chosen for the Reynolds-averaged simulations, with all models overpredicting the intensity of the velocity fluctuations within the cavity flameholder. The hybrid Reynolds-averaged/large-eddy simulation results also overpredicted the velocity variances and covariances, unless a filtering operation was applied using a filter size that matched the control volume used to process the particle image velocimetry measurements. This observation suggests that a significant fraction of the turbulence energy was not resolved by the measurements. Taking this uncertainty into account, the second-order statistics extracted from the hybrid simulation strategy could not be shown to be any more accurate than the “best” Reynolds-averaged result.",55,2

The numerical errors were quantified for the steady-state simulations and at least qualitatively assessed for the scale-resolving simulations before making any claims of predictive accuracy relative to the measurements. The steady-state Reynolds-averaged results displayed a high degree of variability when comparing the flameholder fuel distributions obtained from each turbulence model. This prompted the consideration of applying the higher-fidelity scale-resolving simulations as a surrogate “truth” model to calibrate the Reynolds-averaged closures in a nonreacting setting before their use for the combusting simulations. In general, the Reynolds-averaged velocity profile predictions at the lowest fueling level matched the particle imaging measurements almost as well as was observed for the nonreacting condition. However, the velocity field predictions proved to be more sensitive to the flameholder fueling rate than was indicated in the measurements.",55,2

A high-frequency tonal noise is found to be radiated from the trailing edge of the main wing, and an intense low-frequency tone is detected in the pressure spectra. The instability mechanisms that produce the noise components are examined by phase averaging, autocorrelations, and proper orthogonal decomposition analysis.

18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055001,"To develop jet noise-reduction concepts, it is necessary to understand the physics underlying the noise-generation process. Decomposition of the sound field into azimuthal modes is one of the effective experimental methods that allows extracting subtle features of different types of noise sources. For turbulent flows, the interpretation of the noise analysis results using the azimuthal decomposition technique was developed by the authors in previous papers. In the present paper, a generalization of this method allowing the decomposition of the jet acoustic field into azimuthal modes by means of reduced number of microphones is developed. It is shown that jet noise measurements by only three microphones in each cross section allow reconstruction of three azimuthal mode directivities (axisymmetric, first, and second) for both low and moderate frequency bands. Furthermore, two-microphone measurements, provided the microphones are properly located, make it possible to reconstruct directivity of the axisymmetric mode and total directivity of the first and second modes. The latter method is shown to be suitable for using with an outdoor test bench. The modified methodology is first validated on a small-scale laboratory database. Next, it is applied to the jet of a real engine in ground tests. The information about the azimuthal modes properties may be used to investigate physical aspects of the large-scale jet noise sources.",55,2
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054898,"This paper presents a novel computational approach to characterize hot-spot formations due to impact in polymer-bonded explosives. As the shock propagates through the grain/binder interfaces, the subsequent mechanical and thermal processes lead to localized temperature spikes that can contribute to the ignition of the material and transition to detonation. Hot-spot characteristics are affected by small variations in the microstructure of the polymer-bonded explosive, and therefore require an accurate treatment of the wave propagation over sharp density gradients. For this purpose, a Lagrangian submodel, based on the microscale dynamical model, is used to track the grain/binder interface. Then, hot spots are characterized in terms of the intensity of the impact conditions. Statistical models for the hot spot’s size, temperature, and spatial distribution are generated using the microscale dynamical submodel. The approach uses a mechanistic hot-spot formation model to integrate the effects of the subresolution hot spot in a simulation at the macroscale. Two-dimensional simulations of a randomly packed polymer-bonded explosive sample show hot spots forming in the Estane® binder when using HMX crystals. This technique is then used in a simulation of the shock-to-detonation transition of a two-dimensional randomly packed polymer-bonded explosive. Owing to the inclusion of hot spots, the results show initiation and transition to detonation at relatively lower shock strengths, as seen in experiments.",55,2

To this end, the high-order spectral difference method is implemented with graphics-processing-unit computing. Hypervelocity kinetic-energy impactors are of practical interest, which generate high-pressure deformational shock waves in the target bodies upon impact. Due to the extremely short deformation time associated with hypervelocity impact, the material behaves in a similar manner to a compressible fluid, and the compressible Euler equations can be applied. To model the multiple material interactions, an -phase equation model is adopted into the spectral difference method. All simulations presented are solved with graphics processing units, producing solutions orders of magnitude faster than the central-processing-unit counterpart.

The objective functions for the single-objective optimization are the specific energy absorption and the cost, whereas the metrics for the multiobjective optimization are the two aforementioned along with the peak force, mass, and absorbed energy. By using the polymeric foam, an improvement of 28% on the specific energy absorption is obtained when compared to a component without this reinforcement. Compared to a baseline model, the optimum also reduces the cost by 40%. Three Pareto fronts are obtained with different combinations of objective functions.
