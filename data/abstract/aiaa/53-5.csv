This paper considers optimization from the perspective of information coordination during the solution process. This work aims to determine the potential impact of factors including the role of a system facilitator in managing system-level tradeoffs, the influence of an ideal information scenario, the choice of system variables, and the amount and form of passed information. The goal is not to develop the “best” communication structure or optimization algorithm, but to understand the significance of these factors. A traditional multidisciplinary design optimization coordination framework, a game theoretic approach, and a modified game theory approach are used to mimic design team behaviors. Results suggest these factors can influence the coordination process outcomes: The choice of system variable plays a significant role in the optimality of the final design; perfect information does not necessarily reduce the number of iterations or improve optimality; a system facilitator aids in making better design tradeoffs, though it is possible to achieve optimality without one; and the stability of the design cycle depends on the amount of passed information. This suggests a design team should carefully analyze the initial design space to determine an appropriate design formulation before applying optimization.",53,5

In particular, the UM Mach 2.75 Glass Tunnel with a semi-spanning 7.75 degree wedge was analyzed in attempts to explore key physics pertinent to SBLI’s, including thermodynamic and viscous boundary conditions. A fundamental exploration pertaining to the effects of particle image velocimetry (PIV) on post-processing data is also shown. Results showed an improvement in agreement with experimental data with key contributions by adding a laminar zone upstream of the wedge (the flow is considered transitional downstream of the nozzle throat) and the necessity of mimicking PIV particle lag for comparisons. All CFD analyses utilized the OVERFLOW solver.",53,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053085,"The present paper aims at investigating numerically the control of a 155 mm spin-stabilized projectile using the Coanda effect. The flight Mach number ranges from to . A tangentially blowing jet exits over a convex surface at the base of the projectile and creates flow asymmetry, which generates significant aerodynamic loads. First, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations are performed without projectile rotation. The jet extends 18 deg azimuthally, and numerous continuous blowing conditions are assessed. The variation of the normal force coefficient with respect to the jet momentum coefficient is presented for different freestream Mach numbers. The efficiency loss of the Coanda effect with supersonic jets is specifically discussed. Additionally, comparisons between overexpanded, adapted, and underexpanded supersonic jets are presented. In the second part, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations, accounting for a 400 Hz projectile rotation, are performed. Both continuous and periodic blowing are assessed. A pulsed jet is used in phase with the rotation to always act in a 90 deg sector centered in the lift plane. The resulting normal force benefits are more important than in the nonspinning case, and spin-averaged values lead to a nonzero normal force increment. Then, four pulsed jets equally distributed along the circumference of the projectile are simulated to further improve the control efficiency. The jet separation process is also investigated to determine the influence of the jet on the base pressure distribution.",53,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053134,"This paper presents a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method for computation of compressible turbulent flows in three space dimensions. A modified Spalart-and-Allmaras turbulence model is implemented and discretized to the same order of accuracy as that for the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The creation of curvilinear meshes for arbitrary three-dimensional configurations is achieved through the aid of a computational analysis programming interface, which enables direct communications with the computer-aided design module to determine the true positions of surface quadrature points for high-order geometric representations. A modified linear elasticity approach is used sequentially and is of crucial importance for reshaping the interior mesh to allow high-aspect-ratio curved elements in turbulent boundary layers. Requirements of the mesh parameters, including the wall spacing and viscous stretching factor, are studied; and it is concluded that, for attached turbulent flows, the conventional settings often used in low-order methods should be less stringent when a higher-order method is considered. Several other numerical examples, including a direct numerical simulation of the Taylor–Green vortex and turbulent flow over an ONERA M6 wing, are considered to assess the solution accuracy and to demonstrate the performance of high-order discontinuous Galerkin methods in capturing transitional and turbulent flow phenomena.",53,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053155,"Tests were conducted at the Cryogenic Ludwieg-Tube Göttingen to investigate the influence on onset of boundary-layer transition of thermal gradients on the model surface, whereby the temperature-sensitive paint technique has been used to detect transition. The laminar airfoil under investigation was tested at high Reynolds and at both low and high subsonic Mach numbers. The influence on boundary-layer transition of the temperature difference between the flow and the model surface due to the temperature drop occurring during a test run at the Cryogenic Ludwieg-Tube Göttingen was examined. Various combinations of flow conditions and angles of attack were employed to investigate different stability situations. Linear-stability computations, based on the experimental data, were also carried out. The unfavorable impact of surface temperatures larger than the adiabatic-wall temperature was identified to be dependent on the considered boundary-layer-stability situation. For certain stability situations, it was shown that a nonadiabatic model surface can strongly influence the boundary-layer transition location.",53,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053282,"Sensitivity analysis of structural systems is important for identifying important parameters that influence the dynamic response of a model. This paper describes an extension of the standard Newmark-beta algorithm to the multicomplex mathematical domain such that time-dependent, high-order, high-accuracy derivatives of dynamic systems can be obtained along with the traditional response. In particular, complex and bicomplex analyses were used to compute accurate first and second order derivatives of several example problems. These derivatives were shown to be highly accurate when compared to analytical and finite difference estimates. The method is general and any order derivative including mixed derivatives can be computed.",53,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053285,"Recurrence analysis of phase space trajectories reconstructed from scalar time series—a relatively new technique in the field of combustion dynamics—is proposed for analyzing combustion noise data. A demonstration based on the implementation of this analysis on combustion noise data acquired in experiments on an open bluff-body stabilized turbulent premixed flame is presented in this article. A combined analysis methodology involving conventional techniques: spectral analysis and proper orthogonal decomposition, together with recurrence analysis is found to be effective in identifying features embedded in combustion noise signals. In particular, the new perspective provides insights into the temporal transitions of pressure fluctuations between noise and periodic dynamics. The recurrence analysis technique, which is found to be instrumental in extracting the dynamical makeup of combustion noise signals in this work, is foreseen to be greatly beneficial for the analysis of experimental and numerical results on turbulent flows and turbulent combustion—processes that often involve an interplay between noise and deterministic dynamics.",53,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053309,"The transient blast response of a sandwich panel that consists of a compressible core with in-plane rigidity using the extended high-order sandwich panel theory is presented and compared with elasticity closed-form solutions. The mathematical formulation of the extended high-order sandwich panel theory for the transient dynamic response of sandwich plates is described along with a numerical investigation. The extended high-order sandwich panel theory formulation takes into account the shear resistance of the core and its compressibility, which is envisaged through nonidentical displacements of the upper and the lower facesheets and its in-plane rigidity. The equations of motion and the appropriate boundary conditions are derived using the Hamilton’s principle. A numerical investigation is conducted on a simply supported sandwich panel, and its results are compared with a benchmark elasticity closed-form solution. The results include deformed shapes at the first millisecond at various time steps; displacements of the various constituents, as well as various stress resultants in the facesheets; and stress distributions within the core and at its interfaces with the facesheets. The extended high-order sandwich panel theory and the elasticity benchmark results correlate very well. Finally, a summary is presented and conclusions are drawn.",53,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053362,"This paper proposes a new method of eigenvector-sensitivity analysis for real symmetric systems with repeated eigenvalues and eigenvalue derivatives. The derivation is completed by using information from the second and third derivatives of the eigenproblem, and is applicable to the case of repeated eigenvalue derivatives. The extended systems with a nonsingular coefficient matrix are constructed to calculate the particular solutions. An efficient approach is developed to compute the homogeneous solutions associated with the repeated eigenvalue derivatives. Different constraints for calculating the eigenvector sensitivities are derived and discussed. Four numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.",53,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053339,"In this paper, a full methodology to deal with microvibration predictions onboard satellites is described. Two important aspects are tackled: 1) the characterization of the sources with a pragmatic procedure that allows integrating into the algorithm the full effect of the sources, including their dynamic coupling with the satellite structure; 2) the modeling of the transfer function source receivers with a technique named in this paper as the Craig–Bampton stochastic method, which allows prediction of a nominal response and variations due to structural uncertainties as accurate as full Monte Carlo simulations but at a fraction of the computational effort. The paper then includes a statistical study of the data from the structural dynamic testing of the five identical craft of the Rapid-Eye constellation to set the magnitude of the uncertainties that should be applied in the analysis. Finally, the computational procedure is applied to the new high-resolution satellite SSTL-300-S1 and the predictions compared with the experimental results retrieved during the physical microvibration testing of the satellite, which was carried out at the Surrey Satellite Technology Limited facilities in the United Kingdom.",53,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053308,"In previous work, a complete dynamic inflow model for flow above the rotor disk was developed, and numerical results were presented in both the frequency domain and the time domain. In this paper, the inflow model is extended to all three components of inflow below the disk. The inflow model, which is expressed in terms of a finite number of states, is derived in a mathematically rigorous way. The essence of the extension is that if one computes the costates of the inflow equations (along with the normal states), then one can find the velocity in the hemisphere below the plane of the rotor disk (including the velocity within the wake) with accuracy equal to that of the flow above the rotor plane. The derivation is for the case of general skew angle. To optimize the results from the model, truncating the even terms included in the model is adapted to minimize the error norm for different skew angles. A divergence issue in the calculation of the Legendre functions of the second kind far away from the rotor disk is solved by utilization of a new scheme developed in this paper. Numerical comparisons with exact solutions for the component of flow in axial flow (given for some special cases) illustrate the effectiveness of the new model. The simulations also illustrate that the model is valid for either the frequency domain or the time domain.",53,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053374,"Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes predictions are reported for a single round jet at high Reynolds number and high subsonic Mach number (, ) excited by steady and pulsed control jets. Comparison has been made with experimental validation data to assess the ability of -based unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes modeling for predicting control-jet-driven flow control of near-field jet mixing and potential core-length reduction. The well-known overprediction of the clean (unexcited) core length with this level of turbulence closure remains, but taking this into account, the relative effect of control jets on core-length reduction was predicted remarkably well. For example, steady control jets and pulsed control jets in symmetric/antisymmetric modes indicated a core-length reduction (relative to the unexcited case) of in predictions, compared to in measurements. Comparison of radial profiles showed that unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes modeling was also able to predict the three-dimensional near-field behavior induced by control jets throughout the jet cross section. The vortex structures produced in the pulsed-control-jet predictions were compared. Symmetric and antisymmetric modes produced different vortex structures; these caused different levels of enhanced mixing in the two azimuthal modes and explained the better performance of antisymmetric pulsing.",53,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053407,"The current study reports structural modifications imposed in fully developed, turbulent channel flow by an isolated wall-mounted circular cylinder. The cylinder extended into the logarithmic layer of the flow, perturbing the larger flow scales that embody a significant fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds shear stress. Hot-wire measurements were made in the wake of the wall-mounted circular cylinder at multiple wall-normal and streamwise positions. Besides observing the expected mean velocity deficit in the wake of the cylinder, a secondary peak in streamwise Reynolds normal stress away from the wall was observed, coupled with suppression of the near-wall peak native to the incoming unperturbed, turbulent flow. These observations are similar to those made by Ryan et al. (“ Effects of Simple Wall-Mounted Cylinder Arrangements on a Turbulent Boundary Layer ,” AIAA Journal , Vol.  49 , No.  10 , 2011 , pp.  2210 – 2220 ) for a wall-mounted cylinder protruding into the logarithmic layer of a turbulent boundary layer. Premultiplied velocity spectra elaborated on these energy modifications, specifically the occurrence of two distinct energy peaks at two-thirds of the cylinder height and an attenuation of energy associated with larger flow scales close to the wall. All of these perturbations were found to decay with streamwise distance downstream as the flow relaxed toward the unperturbed state. A clear persistence of the structures at the aforementioned peak at two-thirds cylinder height, similar in scale to the very large-scale motions in canonical wall turbulence, suggests an environment preferring structures of such scale. The influence of the cylinder aspect ratio on the characteristics of the perturbed flow is evaluated, and a distinction in wake structure is identified.",53,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053376,"An experimental study is reported of underexpanded supersonic jet plumes issuing from a high-aspect-ratio convergent rectangular nozzle. Schlieren visualization, Pitot probe, and Laser Doppler Anemometry measurements are carried out to capture the plume development in the near field, and in particular the effect on the plume flow of a finite-length extended shelf or aft-deck attached to the lower nozzle wall. This creates asymmetry in the inviscid shock cell pattern and the entrainment characteristics, both of which influence shear-layer growth and plume trajectory. A net pressure force is induced on the aft-deck wall, which leads to transverse deflection of the jet plume once it leaves the aft-deck, both upward and downward, depending on aft-deck length and nozzle pressure ratio. For sufficiently high nozzle pressure ratio and a sufficiently long aft-deck, separation and reattachment of the plume from the aft-deck is observed. Detailed mapping of both mean velocity and turbulence in the plume near field has been carried out, enabling comparison of flow behavior for a clean nozzle and a nozzle with aft-deck. The data provided are proposed as a suitable benchmark validation test case for computational fluid dynamics studies of rectangular nozzle plumes with aft-deck interaction effects.",53,5

A large-amplitude limit-cycle oscillation has been observed beyond the linear flutter speed in both the computations and in a wind-tunnel experiment. The computations and experiments for the limit-cycle oscillation response of the several yawed plate aeroelastic models show that the inextensible plate theory produces results in good agreement with the measurements. Also, a comparison with results obtained using von Kármán’s nonlinear plate theory has been made.",53,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053416,"A numerical study of the fluid–structure interaction of an inclined tangent ogive-cylinder rigid body, mounted on torsion springs that can rotate in the pitching, yawing, and rolling directions, is conducted. The body is subjected to three-dimensional compressible laminar flow at a Reynolds number of 30,000 and a Mach number of 0.2. A second-order implicit finite difference scheme is employed for the flow equations, adapted to a curvilinear coordinate system, whereas the coupled structural equations, written using an Euler angle notation, are solved by a fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. A detailed investigation of two angles of attack, and , is described. For a fixed body at , the yaw moment changed smoothly with the location of the circumferential disturbance, whereas at the yaw moment was characterized by an almost square-wave variation behavior with bifurcation points at disturbance circumferential roll angles , , and . For an elastically mounted body, the response at for all disturbance locations resulted in large-amplitude periodic yawing and pitching moments. The response at resulted in large-amplitude moments, which occurred only for disturbance locations that coincided with the bifurcation points of the fixed body. The response at the bifurcation points was found to be quasi-periodic for , periodic for , and nonstationary for .",53,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053358,"A finite element method based approach is developed for studying the static, vibration, and buckling behaviors of curvilinearly stiffened plates in the presence of in-plane compressive and tensile stresses. The first-order shear deformation theory is employed for both the plate and the Timoshenko beam modeling. Interpolation functions are used to build the displacement mapping between the stiffener and the plate nodes to allow the stiffener to be placed anywhere within the plate. One of the advantages of the present method is that the plate need not be remeshed while the stiffener configuration is changed; another advantage is that the results obtained by the present method with a much fewer number of elements match well with the results obtained by using a commercial finite element method software. Several numerical examples are solved to study both the static and dynamic behaviors of stiffened plates. The effects of boundary conditions, stiffener eccentricity, stiffener curvature, stiffener-plate geometry parameters, in-plane load condition, stiffener-plate cross-section area ratio, and stiffness ratio on the static and dynamic behaviors of a curvilinearly stiffened plate are investigated. Results have shown that the behavior of the natural frequency parameter as a function of applied in-plane stress could be affected by the plate thickness, in-plane load condition, stiffener-plate cross-section area ratio, and stiffness ratio during compression only, but not when subjected to in-plane tension.",53,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053420,"The shock wave behavior generated from a single shot of pulsed nanosecond dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuator with varying pulse voltages in quiescent air was studied by experiments and numerical simulations. The experiments included using the schlieren technique, a fast response pressure transducer, and a two-velocity-component particle image velocimetry system to measure the propagation of the shock wave, the shock overpressure, and the shock induced flow, respectively. For the numerical simulation, a simple “phenomenological approach” was employed by modeling the plasma region over the encapsulated electrode as a jump-heated and pressurized gas layer. The present investigation revealed that the behaviors of the shock wave generated by the nanosecond pulsed plasma were fundamentally a microblast wave, and their speed and strength were found to increase with higher input voltages. The blast wave occured about 1 to after the discharge of the nanosecond pulse, which was dependent on the input voltages, and then it decayed quickly from a speed of around to a speed of around within about (2–3 mm from the actuator surface). The shock-induced burst perturbations (overpressure and induced velocity) were found to be restricted to a very narrow region (about 1 mm) behind the shock front and lasted only for a few microseconds. In a relatively long time period after the discharge of the plasma, a fairly weak induced vortex structure was observed. These results indicated that the pulsed nanosecond dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuator had stronger local effects in time and spatial domain.",53,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053427,"Within an aerodynamic shape optimization framework, an efficient shape parameterization and deformation scheme is critical to allow flexible deformation of the surface with the maximum possible design space coverage. Numerous approaches have been developed for the geometric representation of airfoils. A fundamental approach is considered here from the geometric perspective; and a method is presented to allow the derivation of efficient, generic, and orthogonal airfoil geometric design variables. This is achieved by the mathematical decomposition of a training library. The resulting geometric modes are independent of a parameterization scheme, surface and volume mesh, and flow solver; thus, they are generally applicable. However, these modes are dependent on the training library, and so a benchmark performance measure, called the airfoil technology factor, has also been incorporated into the scheme to allow intelligent metric-based filtering, or design space reduction, of the training library to ensure efficient airfoil deformation modes are extracted. Results are presented for several geometric shape recovery problems, using two optimization approaches, and it is shown that these mathematically extracted degrees of freedom perform particularly well in all cases, showing excellent design space coverage. These design variables are also shown to outperform those based on other widely used approaches; the Hicks–Henne “bump” functions and a linear (deformative) approximation to Sobieczky's parametric section parameterization are considered.",53,5
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053431,"The paper presents a direct method for predicting the acoustic-intensity vector field around an impedance scattering body. The results obtained from the present method, combined with the equivalent-source method, graphically display the acoustic-intensity vector field around the scattering body, and reveal the effect of surface impedance on the absorption of the acoustic energy. Three test cases (i.e., the plane wave scattered by a rigid sphere, and the sound of the stationary monopole and dipole point sources scattered by an impedance sphere) are carried out to validate the method. From the analysis of the computational error, it is suggested that the maximum length of the surface element should be less than one-tenth of the wavelength to ensure that the relative error is less than 3%.",53,5

The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are solved on overlapping grids using a multigrid method and time spectral method. A new implementation of the multigrid algorithm for overlapping grids is proposed to accelerate hovering and forward-flight computations. Using the time-lagged periodic boundary condition, the time spectral method is combined with the multigrid scheme to significantly improve the simulation efficiency of a helicopter rotor in forward flight. The resulting equations are solved by the implicit lower-upper symmetric-Gauss–Seidel scheme.
