The nominally sharp BFS in a previous wind tunnel experiment is approximated via a smooth shape with a specified maximum slope. The laminar basic state solutions with the BFS are computed by solving the Navier–Stokes equations over a curvilinear grid. The linear amplification of Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities from the effects of basic state modification due to the BFS is quantified in terms of the logarithmic amplification ratio (or factor) and computed with the harmonic linearized Navier–Stokes equations. The transition locations measured at nearly all test conditions with correlate well with a computed factor of , demonstrating the first successful stability-based transition criterion related to step excrescences. An explanation for this successful correlation is that the net destabilization due to the BFS is the dominant contributor to the resulting shift in the transition onset location. The effect of any additional receptivity near the BFS does not play an important role in determining the movement of the transition front.",58,9
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059368,"The low-frequency dynamics of turbulent flow downstream of a backward-facing step are examined by low-pass filtering the velocity fields from a long run-time large-eddy simulation. The low-frequency behaviors were found to set the location of streamwise reattachment. Examination of the instantaneous three-component velocity fields showed regions of flow where the streamwise velocity was momentarily driven all the way back to the step face. After the flow reaches the step, it is then directed along the step face in the spanwise direction, resulting in large regions of wall-normal vorticity . These large regions of vorticity are opposed by smaller regions of counter-rotating flow offset in the spanwise direction and were responsible for the spanwise variation of the reattattachment. The low-pass filtered streamwise velocity fields just above the lower wall showed significant spanwise oscillations with a mean wavelength of the streamwise low-pass filtered reattachment position of , consistent with previous studies at different Reynolds and Mach numbers. As the step geometry is homogeneous in the spanwise direction, this shows that this behavior is not the result of wall or edge effects, which is a conclusion that cannot easily be drawn from experimental studies with limited step-height-to-width ratios.",58,9
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058977,"Local shape control methods, such as B-spline surfaces, are well-conditioned such that they allow high-fidelity design optimization; however, this comes at the cost of degraded optimization convergence rate as control fidelity is refined due to the resulting exponential increase in the size of the design space. Moreover, optimizations in higher-fidelity design spaces become ill-posed due to high-frequency shape components being insufficiently bounded; this can lead to nonsmooth and oscillatory geometries that are invalid in both physicality (shape) and discretization (mesh). This issue is addressed here by developing a geometrically meaningful constraint to reduce the effective degrees of freedom and improve the design space, thereby improving optimization convergence rate and final result. A new approach to shape control is presented using coordinate control to recover shape-relevant displacements and surface gradient constraints to ensure smooth and valid iterates. The new formulation transforms constraints directly onto design variables, and these bound the out-of-plane variations to ensure smooth shapes as well as the in-plane variations for mesh validity. Shape gradient constraints approximating a continuity condition are derived and demonstrated on a challenging test case: inviscid transonic drag minimization of a symmetric NACA0012 airfoil. Significantly, the regularized shape problem is shown to have an optimization convergence rate independent of both shape control fidelity and numerical mesh resolution, while still making use of increased control fidelity to achieve improved results. Consequently, a value of 1.6 drag counts is achieved on the test case, the lowest value achieved by any method.",58,9
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058979,"Panel methods are frequently applied to aerodynamic shape optimization problems due to their fast turnaround time and ability to model arbitrary geometries. Despite being advantageous for design optimization, we have found that panel methods can predict nonphysical results for unconventional geometries. This paper presents robust methods to solve optimization problems using panel methods that are not susceptible to numerical errors. Important factors are highlighted with regard to choice in boundary conditions, induced drag calculation, wake modeling, and regularization. Two parameterization methods are introduced where wing geometry is defined locally by airfoils at discrete spanwise positions and regularized by filtering along the span. Such methods of defining the geometry locally enlarge the design space and allow the optimizer to converge to reliable designs. Results also suggest the following: 1) enforcing a Dirichlet boundary condition rather than a Neumann formulation provides significant cost savings in gradient calculations, 2) far-field force calculations should be adopted for optimization problems as numerical errors in surface pressure integration have a strong influence on the gradients, and 3) the additional design freedom of a B-spline parameterization can be disadvantageous as the low fidelity of the inviscid model cannot correctly capture aerodynamic properties of irregular airfoil geometries.",58,9
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059332,"This paper presents a kriging-based methodology for analyzing aeroelastic gust responses at high angles of attack. Linear analysis becomes inaccurate due to the flow separation at such conditions, thus requiring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. However, the computational expense associated with CFD simulations renders them impractical for analyzing a large number of gust responses. Kriging interpolation is a computationally efficient alternative. In this study, it facilitated the analysis of 2584 one-minus-cosine gust cases with varying mean angles of attack, gust-induced angles of attack, and gust lengths, performed outside the CFD environment, with the help of just 36 CFD simulations. The accuracy of the kriging-based aeroelastic gust analyses was indicated by the extensive validations presented here, and its limitations are also discussed. The results show that, at high angles of attack leading to incipient stall conditions, nonlinear gust responses are relatively lower than their counterparts obtained via linear analysis. However, this drop in the relative response changes drastically with gust length, and this behavior is significantly enhanced with an increase in the angle of attack. This indicates the importance of extensive high-fidelity gust analysis at high angles of attack for structural design applications.",58,9
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059127,"This paper presents a framework for the estimated state regulation of the lift force for a maneuvering wing during a transverse gust encounter. An expression for the effective angle of attack of the wing is derived and used to construct a modified Goman–Khrabrov (GK) model for wing–gust encounters. Experiments were carried out in the University of Maryland water towing facility to identify parameters in the modified GK model and to evaluate its ability to represent gust encounters of varying gust strengths. Using this gust-encounter model, an observer-based feedback controller for pitch actuation is constructed to regulate the coefficient of lift of a wing during a transverse gust encounter. Closed-loop control simulations provided pitching kinematics that mitigated the transient force response. Gust encounter experiments were performed using the control signal from simulation as an open-loop control signal during an encounter with a known gust. The lift force time histories of the gust encounter experiments with control show effective mitigation of the peak lift force. The wing experienced transient forces that merit further investigation, including an initial transient peak and a later undershoot that may be due to uncertainty in the start of the gust region.",58,9
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059428,"Large-eddy simulations (LESs) of low-Reynolds-number flow over a NACA0018 airfoil are performed to investigate flow control at the stall angle of attack (15 deg) by low-amplitude surface waves (actuations) of different types (backward/forward traveling and standing waves) on the airfoil’s suction side. It is found that the backward (toward downstream) traveling waves, inspired from aquatic swimmers, are more effective than forward traveling and standing wave actuations. The results of simulations show that a backward traveling wave with a reduced frequency (, where is frequency; , chord length; and , free flow velocity), a nondimensional wavelength (, where is dimensional wavelength), and a nondimensional amplitude (, where is dimensional amplitude) can suppress stall. In contrast, the flow over the airfoil with either standing or forward traveling wave actuations separates from the leading edge similar to the baseline. Consequently, the backward traveling wave creates the highest lift-to-drag ratio. For traveling waves at a higher amplitude , however, the shear layer becomes unstable from the actuation point and creates periodic coherent structures. Therefore, the lift coefficient decreases compared with the low-amplitude case.",58,9
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059269,"The wake of a circular cylinder was forced with a temporally modulated and spatially segmented dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuator. The temporal modulation was achieved by modulating the applied voltage signal with a square wave whose frequency was twice the vortex shedding frequency. The spatial segmentation was implemented by locating the buried electrodes only at certain spanwise locations along the cylinder in a square-wave pattern. Two blowing ratios (BRs), namely and 0.6, were implemented. In the case of , vortex shedding was significantly attenuated, and the frequencies of the most prominent peaks in the spectra of velocity fluctuations were considerably different along the span. Moreover, the subharmonic mode was found to be stronger behind the non-plasma-forming region compared to the plasma-forming region during forcing with . It also resulted in less drag compared to the unforced case. In the case of , the unsteadiness and the velocity defect in the wake increased compared to the unforced case. Finally, the performance of the segmented actuator was compared with a straight two-dimensional actuator by maintaining the same induced velocity. In this case, a “W”-shaped velocity profile was obtained during both the low- and high-power forcing. Modulated forcing with the straight actuator increased the drag compared to the unforced case.",58,9
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058692,"In this research, a loop-separation concept (LSC) is applied to a very flexible aircraft. Appealing features of this control architecture include decoupled control logic and the use of high-order models for controller design, thus not requiring model order reduction. The LSC consists of two control loops. The inner loop employs a linear quadratic regulator capable of stabilizing the aircraft while controlling the shape of the half-wings independently from each other by artificially stiffening the structure. Structural dynamics can potentially be used in the design of the inner-loop regulator. The outer-loop design is based on rigid-body outputs. The outer loops for tracking velocity, heading, sideslip angle, and altitude are designed using nonsmooth optimization techniques. Numerical results show that structural feedback in the inner loop yields better regulation performance and reduced structural deformations. The autopilot is capable of attaining the commanded reference with low control energy while meeting the maneuver requirements and regulating the elastic deformations of the wing.",58,9
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059255,"The flowfield around the rotor blades of a wind turbine is extremely complex due to the occurrence of several aerodynamic phenomena. It is all the more true for floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs), for which the six rigid-body motions of the floating platform can induce blade–wake interactions. Therefore conventional numerical approaches for wind turbine applications, such as Blade Element Momentum Theory, may be questionable for an accurate prediction of floating wind turbine aerodynamic loads. Consequently, the current paper investigates the aerodynamic behavior of an FOWT subjected to several idealized prescribed motions, representative of a wave movement, based on computational fluid dynamics simulations. These results, obtained on the NREL 5-MW wind turbine, are compared with previous results found in the literature and analyzed to provide a better understanding of the involved aerodynamic phenomena.",58,9
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059114,"Unsteady flow characteristics are investigated using wall-modeled large-eddy simulation for a 30P30N three-element airfoil with streamwise ice and horn ice accreted at its slat leading edge, respectively. The ice accretions cause massive flow separation above the slat, which results in a surface pressure plateau on the slat and further unloads the downstream wing elements. The above mentioned two ice shapes lead to lift decreases of 10.66 and 16.45% and drag increases of 44.58 and 59.42%, respectively. Ice-induced vortices first roll up due to Kelvin–Helmholtz instability above the slat with ice accretions, and the subsequent vortex pairing halves their characteristic motion frequency. The developed vortices, composed of multiscale structures, dominate the slat upper surface and are convected through the main element to aggravate the flow separation over the flap. Moreover, extremely strong acoustic resonance occurs in the iced slat cove, and its tonal frequencies are consistent with theoretical model predictions. These intense tones are believed to result from the elevated pressure fluctuations along the cavity free shear layer, which are in turn related to the propagation of the ice-induced pressure fluctuations from above the slat because their most dominant frequencies identified by proper orthogonal decomposition are nearly equal to the resonant frequencies.",58,9
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059206,"Ice formation on a wing poses a threat to aircraft safety because it changes the effective shape of the wing and considerably deteriorates the aerodynamic performance. The performance prediction of an iced airfoil requires an accurate turbulence model. In this Paper, a three-equation turbulence model for the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation is developed to determine the stall behavior of iced airfoils. The model is implemented using a linear eddy viscosity transition model as a baseline and is modified to appropriately simulate complex flow phenomena such as laminar separation, shear layer transition, and turbulent reattachment. The model also takes the nonequilibrium characteristics of turbulence into account. Different airfoils, including clean airfoils and three types of iced airfoils (horn ice, streamwise ice, and spanwise-ridge ice), are numerically tested. The results indicate that the present model demonstrates engineering accuracy in terms of the stall behavior prediction and can be adapted in a wide range of ice shapes. The relative errors of the predicted maximum lift coefficients of the iced airfoils are about 5% of the experimental values.",58,9
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058560,"An investigation is carried out to evaluate how an external uniform stream affects turbulent-jet coherent structures. The presence of this uniform stream outside the jet represents the effect of forward flight on the velocity field. Coherent structures are modelled as wave packets, and the flight effect is studied using the parabolized stability equations (PSEs). Measurements of mean base flows and axial velocity fluctuations on the jet centerline at assumed flight conditions are described. The velocity fields were supplied to a PSE model to retrieve the wave packet signatures of axial velocity fluctuations. Overall results are in good agreement with experimental measurements. There is an observed increase in wave packet wavelengths and phase velocities (with respect to the nozzle) as flight velocity increases. Also, axial amplification rates are determined and show stabilization in the near-nozzle region, which is confirmed by experimental power spectral densities on the jet centerline. This tendency holds as the freestream velocity increases.",58,9
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059295,"This experimental study explored the effects of axisymmetric sinusoidal excitation on structural and mixing characteristics in the equidensity jet in crossflow (JICF). Planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging of acetone seeded in the jet fluid was used in this quantification, where the jet Reynolds number was fixed at and crossflow velocity was varied. Jet-to-crossflow momentum-flux ratios ranged from , with a convectively unstable upstream shear layer (USL) in the absence of forcing, to , with a globally unstable USL. Sinusoidal excitation had a relatively significant influence on the convectively unstable JICF at larger values, especially when the USL was locked-in to the forcing frequency, causing the jet cross section to become more symmetric and causing molecular mixing, quantified in both centerplane and cross-sectional planes, to improve. For a globally unstable JICF, only sinusoidal forcing corresponding to clear lock-in conditions, close to the fundamental shear-layer frequency and/or at very high amplitudes, affected jet structure, with somewhat moderate improvements in molecular mixing. Typically, excitation conditions creating enhanced jet penetration and spread did not correlate directly with improved molecular mixing; there was a stronger correlation of improved mixing with creation of a more symmetric jet cross section, in some cases with a counter-rotating vortex pair structure.",58,9
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059203,"This paper considers the fusion of two aerodynamic data sets originating from differing types of physical or computer experiments. This paper specifically addresses the fusion of 1) noisy and in-complete fields from wind-tunnel measurements and 2) deterministic but biased fields from numerical simulations. These two data sources are fused in order to estimate the true field that best matches measured quantities that serve as the ground truth. For example, two sources of pressure fields about an aircraft are fused based on measured forces and moments from a wind-tunnel experiment. A fundamental challenge in this problem is that the true field is unknown and cannot be estimated with 100% certainty. A Bayesian framework is employed to infer the true fields conditioned on measured quantities of interest; essentially a statistical correction to the data is performed. The fused data may then be used to construct more accurate surrogate models suitable for early stages of aerospace design. An extension of the proper orthogonal decomposition with constraints is also introduced to solve the same problem. Both methods are demonstrated on fusing the pressure distributions for flow past the RAE2822 airfoil and the Common Research Model wing at transonic conditions. Comparison of both methods reveals that the Bayesian method is more robust when data are scarce and capable of also accounting for uncertainties in the data. Furthermore, given adequate data, the proper-orthogonal-decomposition-based and Bayesian approaches lead to surprisingly similar results.",58,9
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059207,"Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) yields a linear, approximate model of a system’s dynamics that is built from data. This paper seeks to reduce the order of this model by identifying a reduced set of modes that best fit the output. A model selection algorithm from statistics and machine learning known as least angle regression (LARS) is adopted. LARS is modified to be complex-valued, and LARS is used to select DMD modes. The resulting algorithm is referred to as least angle regression for dynamic mode decomposition (LARS4DMD). Sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition (DMDSP), a popular mode-selection algorithm, serves as a benchmark for comparison. LARS4DMD has the advantage that the sparsity parameter required for DMDSP is not needed. Numerical results from a Poiseuille flow test problem show that LARS4DMD yields reduced-order models that have comparable performance to DMDSP. Use of the LARS4DMD algorithm on particle image velocimetry data of a rotating fin confirms this conclusion on experimental data. Results further suggest that LARS4DMD may be slightly more robust to noise in the experimental data.",58,9
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059341,"Compressive sensing (CS) based fan noise mode detection methods have been developed recently by taking advantage of the fact that the fan noise sound field is usually dominated by a limited set of modes. It has been shown that the CS based methods require remarkably few measurements and can improve mode detection capability. However, the mode sparsity would be easily destroyed either due to strong noise interference or attenuation of spinning modes. In this Paper, a nonconvex CS method based on minimization algorithm is proposed for fan noise azimuthal mode detection. A series of numerical simulations shows that the new based CS method is more robust to measurement noise and can enhance the mode sparsity under background noise interference. In the case in which the background noise level is unknown, the new based CS method with level correction can successfully reconstruct the mode spectrum by using an underestimated noise level. Compared to the previous convex based CS method, the new based nonconvex CS method reduces the number of sensors and requires weaker constraints for sensor array, which is beneficial for optimal array design in practical tests. In addition, the new method can decrease the reconstruction error and improve the dynamic range. An experimental system is implemented to validate the new method. It is demonstrated that the new method can enhance the mode sparsity and improve the dynamic range by about 10 dB.",58,9

Recent progress has matured a number of independent implementations of flow solvers, error estimation methods, and anisotropic grid adaptation mechanics. Here, the interoperability of several separately developed unstructured grid adaptation tools is verified using analytic functions and the Code Comparison Principle. Three analytic functions with different smoothness properties are adapted to show the impact of smoothness on implementation differences. A scalar advection-diffusion problem with an analytic solution that models a boundary layer is adapted to test individual grid adaptation components. While optimal asymptotic error convergence rates are achieved with many grid adaptation tool combinations for the scalar problems, the scalar problems also illustrate known differences in grid adaptation component implementations and a previously unknown interaction between components. Laminar flow over a delta wing is verified with multiple, independent grid adaptation procedures to show consistent convergence to fine-grid forces and pitching moment.

The methodology is based on the entropy-adjoint approach, which corresponds to a standard output-based adjoint method with the output functional targeting areas of spurious generation of entropy.

In addition, the work reports on the parallel efficiency of the solver, which has been optimized through a multiconstraint domain decomposition algorithm available within the Metis 5.0 library. The reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of the approach are assessed by computing three test cases: the two-dimensional, laminar, chaotic flow around a square at ; and the implicit large-eddy simulation of the flow past a circular cylinder at and past a square cylinder at .

Full-field direct simulations with vibrational nonequilibrium are performed over uniform and stratified atmospheres, extending from a supersonic body to the ground level. The governing equations are the three-dimensional Euler equations, combined with the conservation equations for vibrational energies of and . The translational–vibrational energy exchange is evaluated using the Landau–Teller rate model. The full-field simulations reproduce the Drop test for Simplified Evaluation of Non-symmetrically Distributed sonic boom (D-SEND) #1, by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The computational results show that weak shock waves at a moderate relaxation time are dispersed, and the rise time occurs. A wave structure in one relaxing mode is classified according to the relaxation time. The effects of two relaxing modes are comparable to those obtained from a superposition of each mode. For a stratified atmosphere, the effects of vibrational relaxation at each altitude are similar to those for uniform atmospheres at the same altitudes. However, a wave structure does not monotonically change toward the ground, unlike the case of uniform atmosphere. Such a complex transition mechanism of wave structure in real atmospheric environments is clarified.",58,9

This creates an environment that is challenging to implement research diagnostics. The two most common diagnostics implemented in RDEs operating at speeds capable of defining the detonation wave are dynamic pressure transducers and ion probes. In the case of dynamic pressure transducers, hardware cost and excessive temperatures often dictate remotely coupled transducers, such as a semi-infinite tube pressure configuration in order to improve survivability. Ion probes, on the other hand, are much more robust and can be installed directly within the combustion annulus. However, the information obtained by ion probes in RDEs has been largely qualitative, with their primary use being wave tracking for speed and directionality. This paper presents methodology for determining quantitative ion concentrations from raw ion probe current–voltage data, using known geometry and appropriate electrostatic probe theory.

The mean flow behind the shock can be divided into three layers: outer layer, entropy layer, and boundary layer. With the forcing of an acoustic wave, the excited disturbances at downstream locations close to the nose include the fast mode in the boundary layer and the disturbances in the entropy layer and outer layer. Direct numerical simulations show that the disturbance in the entropy layer actually plays a key role in exciting the second mode. The whole process of receptivity is found to follow a three-stage route. In the first stage, the fast mode is excited in the boundary layer. Although it has a dominant amplitude initially, it experiences a significant decay. In the second stage, it is overtaken by the disturbance in the entropy layer. In the third stage, the latter enters the boundary layer and excites the second mode near the lower branch, which is due to a different mechanism of synchronism.",58,9

Streamwise and spanwise wall heat flux are compared to the experimental data that were obtained at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and the California Institute of Technology. In previous studies, there were concerns that portions of the flowfield were rarefied; however, after an in-depth analysis, we find the flowfield to be firmly in the continuum regime. Comparisons of heat flux at an instant of time in the simulations show good agreement with the experiments. However, averaged heat flux over a long period of time relative to the experimental test time are underpredicted and develop low-frequency periodic motion. To better understand the unsteadiness and three-dimensionality of the flowfield, we analyze the mass flux through a spanwise plane, and we perform sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition for the wall heat flux and midplane pressure.

A precise shock train leading edge detection technique is indispensable for controlling the shock train within the isolator. In this Paper, a reconstruction-flowfield-based shock train leading edge detection method is proposed. A flowfield reconstruction model based on a convolutional neural network provides instantaneous flowfield structure, and then image processing is carried out on these flowfield images to obtain the shock train leading edge. A supersonic direct-connect wind tunnel was used to collect all the data, which were then postprocessed to train the convolutional neural network model. The trained model successfully reconstructed the flowfield structure based on the measured wall pressure, and the reconstruction effects under different pressure transducer arrangements were compared. The flowfield reconstruction model provides a richer information source for shock train leading edge detection, and the detection accuracy can be greatly improved.

The explicit nature of these pertubatory forces is provided. It is shown that the matrices that describe these perturbatory forces are not required to commute with the potential matrix. The general positional perturbatory forces that bring about instability in the perturbed potential system are shown to include, as special cases, circulatory forces that do and that do not commute with the potential matrix. The condition on commutativity of matrices is quite stringent, and its removal has a significant effect on generalizing the conditions that lead to instability. The paper expands the generalized Merkin instability result to include more general, noncirculatory positional perturbations, and it eliminates restrictions imposed on the perturbations by commutation requirements. The structure of infinitesimal as well as finite perturbatory matrices that guarantee instability is obtained. Practical implications of the mathematical results to natural and engineered systems are given. It is pointed out that potential systems with two “nearly” equal frequencies of vibration are, in general, susceptible to instability, created by “small” perturbatory forces, where the terms nearly and small are quantified.",58,9
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058942,"This paper investigates the dynamics of a pitching and heaving aeroelastic wing undergoing large-amplitude limit-cycle oscillations influenced by a vortical wake from an upstream rectangular cylinder bluff body. The results show that under certain conditions, the limit cycle is annihilated. The conditions in which annihilation occurs are dependent on the limit-cycle frequency, bluff-body shedding frequency, and the magnitude of the mass coupling in the system. The low mass coupling configuration shows that vortical disturbances on the wing cause minor amplitude modulation until the shedding frequency is within a critical distance of the third harmonic of the limit-cycle oscillation frequency. Within this band, the amplitude modulations grow such that the pitch amplitude varies by up to 10 deg. When the mass coupling is increased and when the shedding frequency is within a critical distance of the third harmonic, the limit cycle is annihilated and the system returns to equilibrium. The annihilation phenomenon is caused by the addition of strong aerodynamic coupling between the vortex wake and the wing, influencing the limit-cycle kinematics such that the limit-cycle returns to the equilibrium position. The paper discusses both the kinematic and aerodynamic behaviors of wake-influenced aeroelastic limit-cycle annihilation.",58,9
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058760,"This paper describes an automated approach to deform an analysis mesh applied to a computer-aided design (CAD) model in response to a change in the shape of the CAD model. The process has been used to overcome a key issue that occurs during the shape optimization process. It is an advance over existing techniques because it works even when the boundary topology of the CAD model changes during the shape change, which other approaches cannot generally accommodate. To achieve the deformation, an analysis topology representation is created for each model, such that there is a one-to-one mapping between the analysis topology representing the models before and after the shape change. Strategies are presented to parameterize the superset entities in the analysis topology that have no global mathematical definition. The surface mesh is deformed in a way that allows the underlying surface/edge parameterizations to change, and it is shown how the domain mesh can be updated based on the surface mesh deformation. If the models before and after shape change have the same genus, then a small dimensional change in the shape of the model will result in meshes with the same topology, even if the topology of the underlying CAD representation has changed. This is highly desirable when evaluating sensitivities to a design change during an optimization.",58,9

Changes in stiffness, ratcheting strain, loss factor , loss modulus , storage modulus , dissipated energy , and potential energy with the number of fatigue cycles were measured at room temperature (RT), , and 50°C. It was found that fatigue lives were longer at than at RT and 50°C. Fatigue life at plastic strain threshold was decreased by about 98% of the joint lifetime at 50°C. The behavior of agrees qualitatively with and . The improved ductility of the SAJs at 50°C induces significant changes in and , and hence they can be used to monitor the integrity of the SAJs and early prediction of fatigue failure. At , the and behave approximately in a linear constant manner up to sudden failure without warning. Accordingly, safe design fatigue life based on time to first failure was applied to evaluate the stress versus number of cycles to failure curves of the SAJs at different reliabilities.",58,9
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058908,"A mechanics-based modeling approach is developed to rapidly predict damage in polymer matrix composites resulting from a low-velocity impact event. The approach is incorporated into a computer code that provides an efficient means to assess the damage resistance of unidirectional composite laminates with a range of layup configurations and impact scenarios. It is envisioned that the developed approach will aid in early design and analysis of composite structures where sizing and layup decisions must be made, and evaluating the feasibility of a large number of laminate configurations using numerical approaches such as finite element analysis is prohibitively expensive in practice. Therefore, the goal of the modeling approach is to predict the impact damage size given the laminate configuration and impact scenario. The tool is designed to run quickly (less than 2 min) to allow a large number of design cases to be investigated. The results presented demonstrate that the model is capable of efficiently predicting low-velocity impact damage size, shape, and location within an acceptable accuracy suitable for preliminary design and analysis of composite structures.",58,9
