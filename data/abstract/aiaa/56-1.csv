2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055360,"An optical tracking facility was used to record the free flight of the Monarch butterfly for a large number of sequential flaps. The system automatically tracked reflective markers, which were modified to reduce the effects of additional mass on the flight characteristics. Measurements were analyzed over 75 flights of 9 butterflies in a climbing trajectory covering a large range of climbing rates. The flapping frequency remained fairly constant at 9.8 Hz. The peak-to-peak flapping amplitude varied more significantly with an average of 246.4°. The phase offset between flapping and body undulation averaged 89°. The body oscillation amplitude was 4.9 mm. Simulations using Theodorsen’s equation coupled with a single mass dynamics equation resulted in a body motion that closely agreed with the observed data. The undulation amplitude increased with the flapping amplitude, but decreased with wing loading. Butterflies have the lowest wing loading among insects, consistent with their large body undulation amplitudes. The wing–body phase offset solely depends on the reduced frequency, a consequence of the timing between the noncirculatory and circulatory forces. These results suggest that this novel experimental framework can increase our understanding of biological flight and development of micro flapping robots.",56,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055739,"The effects of stroke deviation of a flapping model insect wing on its aerodynamic force production are studied by solving the Navier–Stokes equations. Stroke deviation of a flapping wing often takes the forms of various out-of-plane wing-tip trajectories that depend on the time variation of the stroke deviation angle. In the present paper, four typical wing-tip trajectories, referred to as cases A–D, were used to investigate the effect of stroke deviation by comparing the aerodynamic forces, flows, and power requirements of the flapping wings with and without stroke deviation. The stroke deviation has remarkable influences on the time course of the aerodynamic force of a flapping wing. The influences could be explained by two mechanisms: one is the added-rotation effect, which is introduced by the deviation angle of the wing; the other is the change in effective angle of attack of the wing, which is due to the angular speed of the deviation. In general, the stroke deviation only produces a small effect on the cycle-mean aerodynamic forces, because the changes due to stroke deviation could be roughly offset in a wingbeat cycle. The analysis of power requirements shows that stroke deviation will generally lead to an increase in energy consumption for insect flights, indicating that insects should have the tendency to maintain the flapping motion in a plane for hovering or low-speed flight, as is observed in nature.",56,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056048,"Airfoil stall at low Reynolds numbers is a complex nonlinear dynamic phenomenon, which is characterized by catastrophe and hysteresis. It is difficult but important to mathematically describe the stall points under different Reynolds numbers. In this paper, taking the clockwise hysteresis as an example, a modeling method is proposed to describe the boundary of static airfoil stall according to the topological properties and physical characteristics of airfoil stall. Through numerical simulations, the lift characteristics of an airfoil at different Reynolds numbers are computed, and it is found that Reynolds number can affect not only the catastrophe and hysteresis of airfoil stall, but also the size of the hysteresis loop. Next, the static stall at low Reynolds numbers and the dynamic behavior described by the cusp-catastrophic model are proved to have a similarity in spatial topology and physical properties. According to the topological invariant rules, the topological-mapping relationship between the catastrophe-point set of the cusp-catastrophic model and the stall points of the airfoil stall is established through the development of an accurate topological-transformation function. Consequently, the catastrophe lines described by the cusp-catastrophic model can be used to represent the static-stall boundary of the airfoil at different Reynolds numbers. The effect of model description is verified by comparing the model-predicted values with the simulated values, and the error is found to be less than 1%.",56,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056108,"The onset of unsteady separation and dynamic stall vortex formation over a constant-rate pitching airfoil is analyzed by means of high-fidelity large-eddy simulations. The flowfields are computed by employing a previously developed and extensively validated high-fidelity implicit large-eddy simulation approach based on high-order compact schemes. A NACA 0012 airfoil section is considered at a freestream Mach number of and chord-based Reynolds numbers of . The wing is pitched about its quarter-chord axis at a nominally constant nondimensional rate of from a small initial incidence to an angle of attack beyond the onset of dynamic stall. The unsteady boundary-layer behavior that precedes the dynamic stall vortex formation is described in detail. It is found that the process is characterized by the presence of a laminar separation bubble that contracts with increasing angle of attack as leading-edge suction builds up. Beyond a critical incidence, the laminar separation bubble breaks down and rapid suction collapse ensues. Abrupt turbulent separation follows, allowing the turbulent boundary-layer vorticity to coalesce into a coherent dynamic stall vortex. The remaining turbulent boundary-layer vorticity rolls up into a shear-layer vortex that imparts a much weaker signature on the surface pressure. Maximum surface pressure fluctuations of very high frequency are observed near the leading edge just before laminar separation bubble bursting. The fluctuation level drops significantly as the shear layer moves away from the airfoil surface.",56,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055921,"An experimental investigation has been conducted to examine the influence of a single leading-edge protuberance on the performance of a baseline NACA airfoil. Static aerodynamic forces of the airfoils have been measured as the angle of attack increased and decreased. A hysteresis loop of the lift coefficient around the stall angle is observed for the baseline airfoil, with a sharp decline of the lift coefficient during angle-of-attack increase and a delayed recovery during angle-of-attack decrease. It was discovered for the first time that both the decline and the recovery of the lift coefficient of the modified airfoil with a single leading-edge protuberance included two steps. When the first step happened, the lift coefficient reached an intermediate value between the maximum value and the poststall value of the baseline airfoil, and it remained almost constant within a range of angles of attack. Surface tuft visualization revealed that, during the first step of stall, one side of the modified airfoil was stalled with leading-edge separation, whereas the other side remained in a nonstall condition. When the second step of stall happened, both sides of the modified airfoil were stalled, except for an attached flow on the protuberance peak. This one-sided stall phenomenon indicated that one important role of the leading-edge protuberance might be confining the local stall region from extending spanwise, which is similar to the effect of a wing fence.",56,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056071,"Dynamic stall is observed in numerous applications, including sharply maneuvering fixed-wing aircraft, biomimetics, wind turbines, and most notably, rotorcraft. The associated unsteady loading can lead to aerodynamic flutter and mechanical failure in the system. The present work explores the ability of nanosecond pulse-driven dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators to control dynamic stall over a NACA 0015 airfoil. The Reynolds number, reduced frequency, and excitation Strouhal number were varied over large ranges: , , and , respectively. Surface pressure measurements were taken for each combination of Reynolds number, reduced frequency, and excitation Strouhal number. Phase-locked particle image velocimetry measurements were acquired for select cases. It was observed that the trends of effect of were similar for all combinations of Reynolds number and reduced frequency, and three major conclusions were drawn. First, it was observed that low Strouhal number excitation results in oscillatory aerodynamic loading in the stalled stage of dynamic stall. This oscillatory behavior was gradually reduced as increased and was not observed beyond . Second, all excitation resulted in earlier flow reattachment. Last, it was shown that excitation, especially at high , resulted in reduced aerodynamic hysteresis and dynamic stall vortex strength. The decrease in the strength of the dynamic stall vortex is achieved by the formation of large-scale structures induced by the excitation that bleed the leading-edge vorticity before the ejection of the dynamic stall vortex. At sufficiently high excitation Strouhal numbers , the dynamic stall vortex was completely suppressed.",56,1

The unsteady blowing in the form of a periodic square pattern at 25% duty cycle is provided at the excitation frequencies varying from 2 to 24 Hz for a fixed momentum coefficient. The flow structure is characterized at Reynolds number for the angles of attack varying from 7 to 20 deg. The results indicate that unsteady blowing through the leading edges of the planform is quite successful in elimination of localized separation from the surface of the planform. In comparison with the steady blowing, the periodic blowing at relatively higher excitation frequency induces substantial improvement in flowfield and demonstrates superior performance even at significantly lower total momentum.",56,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055796,"A parametric experimental study was performed with sweeping jet actuators (fluidic oscillators) to determine their effectiveness in controlling flow separation on an adverse pressure gradient ramp. Parameters that were investigated included actuator placement (that is, pitch and spreading angles, streamwise location) and actuator size. Microvortex generators were also used to provide a reference control case for comparisons. Surface pressure measurements and surface oilflow visualization were used to characterize the effects of these parameters on the actuator performance. Two-dimensional particle image velocimetry measurements of the flowfield over the ramp and hot-wire measurements of the actuator’s jet flow were also obtained for selective cases. The results suggest that an actuator with a wider jet spreading (110 versus 70 deg) placed closer (2.3 versus 7 boundary-layer thickness upstream) to the flow separation location provides better performance. Different actuator sizes obtained by scaling down the actuator geometry produced different jet spreading. Scaling down the actuator (based on the throat dimensions) from to resulted in similar flow control performance; however, scaling down the actuator further to reduced the actuator efficiency by reducing the jet spreading considerably. The results of this study provide insight that can be used to design and select the optimal sweeping jet actuator configuration for flow control applications.",56,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056255,"A numerical study is conducted to explore the unsteady nature of fluidic oscillators, which are responsible for generating sweeping jets for effective flow control of large-scale applications. Two- and three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and three-dimensional improved delayed detached-eddy simulations are employed to simulate and resolve the flow structures in the internal flow passages of a fluidic oscillator and an external flowfield in a quiescent flow condition. The predicted flow generated by an enlarged actuator with an outlet diameter of 25 mm using air as a working fluid is validated against measurements at various supply rates. A comparison of current computational results using two-dimensional and three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations with experiments indicates a reasonable agreement in the jet oscillation frequency. However, a significant discrepancy in the streamwise velocity field is observed between the two-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and experimental data. The three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation also underpredicts the jet width, and consequently overpredicts the extension of the jet in the axial direction downstream of the actuator exit. Excellent agreement in the jet oscillation frequency and internal and external flowfields is obtained at two supply rates between the three-dimensional improved delayed detached-eddy simulation and the measurements. Simulations are also performed for a small-scaled actuator with a hydraulic outlet diameter of 1.3 mm, with water as the working fluid. The predicted oscillation frequency of the jet is compared with the experiments. A scaling analysis is also conducted by analyzing and correlating the flow characteristics and key parameters of the two actuators’ scales.",56,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056157,"Active unsteady flow control experiments were performed on a natural laminar flow airfoil at . The goal of this study was to control boundary-layer separation across the trailing-edge region of the airfoil in off-design conditions. Active control of separation was achieved using a series of blowing slots at the location. An adaptive closed-loop controller was developed based on the empirical mode decomposition algorithm. This controller was capable of automatically identifying the frequencies of natural instabilities in the flowfield, which were then used to set the driving frequencies of the flow control system. The airfoil performance with closed-loop frequency control was compared against a canonical open loop actuation. The differences in flowfield characteristics between these two cases were investigated in detail using particle image velocimetry measurements across the trailing-edge region of the airfoil. Closed-loop frequency control was observed to be associated with more effective alleviation of flow separation, having a shear layer closer to the surface of the airfoil in comparison with actuation. The empirical mode decomposition algorithm was also used to simultaneously perform closed-loop control of the actuation frequency and amplitude to achieve a desired value of .",56,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056088,"This paper is a continuation of the paper recently published by Hue et al. (“Experimental and Numerical Methods for Transition and Drag Predictions of Laminar Airfoils,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 53, No. 9, Sept. 2015, pp. 2694–2712) that focused on transition and drag predictions of laminar airfoils. The extension of such studies to three-dimensional configurations representative of modern civil aircraft is a further step toward the implementation of natural laminar-flow technologies. The present work, therefore, focuses on validating the laminar design of a low-swept wing for business jet applications. In 2015, an experimental campaign was carried out in the European Transonic Windtunnel, and included laminar/turbulent transition measurements with temperature-sensitive paint at Mach and Reynolds numbers typical of cruise flight conditions. Subsequently, fluid dynamics computations were performed on this aircraft geometry either with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver using both Tollmien–Schlichting and crossflow transition criteria, or with a boundary-layer code using either database methods for transition location or exact stability analyses. In this paper, experimental and numerical transition predictions are compared for three representative cases corresponding to different angles of attack. The agreement that is achieved is satisfactory, and extended regions of laminar flow are observed on the wing at cruise lift levels. In these conditions, the drag reduction can account for 10–15% of the aircraft drag.",56,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056167,"A transition transport model has been coupled with the SSG/LRR- differential Reynolds stress model to form a new transition and turbulence model containing nine transport equations. The aim is to handle complex turbulent flow together with wall-bounded transitional flow for industrial applications. Based on the difference between the Menter SST turbulence model and the SSG/LRR- model, special treatments are introduced for the length-scale determining equation of the turbulence model and the transition onset function of the intermittency transport equation of the transition model. The final transitional Reynolds stress model is calibrated based on zero-pressure-gradient flat plate flow. Additionally, a study on grid influences based on flat plate flow has been conducted. As a result, the presented model is able to predict transitional flows, including Tollmien-Schlichting transition, by-pass transition, and separation-induced transition, as well as considering complex turbulent flows. The model is validated for a number of test cases, including two-dimensional airfoils and the DLR prolate spheroid. The results are compared against transitional computations using the Langtry & Menter SST model and fully turbulent computations using the standard SSG/LRR- model. The comparisons show that the nine-equation transition model has equal or higher accuracy as the SST model for different types of flows.",56,1

Three deterministic forms of upstream flow disturbances are considered, including sharp-edge gust, time-harmonic gust, and Taylor vortex models. The results obtained for the airfoil unsteady aerodynamic responses to gust perturbations with variable amplitude and duration are discussed in comparison with results from linearized inviscid incompressible unsteady aerodynamic theory to elucidate the importance of viscous effects in the considered flow regimes. Overall, the investigation reveals that the high-amplitude gust responses correlate well with inviscid theories, which is in contrast to the low-amplitude gust responses that appear to be strongly affected by viscous effects.",56,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056028,"An experiment investigating the nonlinear breakdown of hypersonic stationary crossflow waves has been conducted in a Mach 6 quiet tunnel. Secondary instabilities of the stationary waves were measured on a sharp, 7 deg half-angle cone at a 6 deg angle of attack, from 110 to 160 deg from the windward ray. A secondary instability was measured as it grew over a range of amplitudes until the onset of turbulence. The initial linear growth rate of the secondary instability was about , with a peak growth before breakdown of about from the sensor noise floor. At least two frequency bands of the secondary instability appeared to exist concurrently, with each spatially confined within a region of the stationary vortex. The instability wave speeds and frequencies were measured at several azimuthal locations. The wave group velocities were near the edge velocity, regardless of azimuthal location. The instability frequencies were between 140 and 300 kHz, and they generally decreased with the increasing azimuthal angle from the windward ray.",56,1

Simulations are performed for hypersonic boundary-layer flows over a 7 deg half-angle straight cone with varying bluntness at a freestream Mach number of 10. The steady and the unsteady flowfields are obtained by solving the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations in axisymmetric coordinates using a fifth-order-accurate weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme for space discretization and using a third-order total-variation-diminishing Runge–Kutta scheme for time integration. The calculated factors at the transition onset location increase gradually with increasing unit Reynolds numbers for flow over a sharp cone and remain almost the same for flow over a blunt cone. The receptivity coefficient increases slightly with increasing unit Reynolds numbers. They are on the order of four for a sharp cone and are on the order of one for a blunt cone. The location of transition onset predicted from the simulation including the freestream spectrum, receptivity, and the linear and the weakly nonlinear evolutions yields a solution close to the measured onset location for the sharp cone. The simulations overpredict transition onset by about 20% for the blunt cone.",56,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056126,"A configuration of prismatic elements in boundary layers created by marching a surface triangulation on viscous walls along certain directions is a typical mesh for viscous-flow simulations. The quality of the resulting elements and the reliability of the meshing procedure thus highly depend on the computing strategy used to determine the marching directions. In this study, the authors propose to compute a field of marching directions governed by Laplacian equations. This new approach can ensure the smooth transition of marching directions, and thereby lead to more desirable element shapes. In addition, the possible intersections of boundary-layer elements growing from the opposite sides of a narrow region can be identified by analyzing the vector field. With respect to the solution of the governing equation, the boundary element method is preferred because of its advantageous solution accuracy. Because the boundary element method only needs a surface-triangulation input, there is no need to create a volume background mesh. Following the aforementioned idea, a new hybrid prismatic meshing method is developed, and the capability of the method is demonstrated by meshing experiments on models with complex geometries.",56,1

The particle trajectories are computed by an Eulerian trajectory method. The effects of heat transfer and phase change on the particle trajectory and on the impact at the icing surface are taken into account. The computation of the evolution of the ice layer includes the contributions of ice and liquid water for mixed-phase conditions as well as the effects of erosion caused by ice crystals. Verification and validation benchmarks are carried out for a NACA 0012 airfoil and a streamlined shape with a curved cylindrical nose. It is shown that the ice thickness and shape are predicted accurately by the proposed method.",56,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055678,"Fixed point iteration is a common strategy to handle interdisciplinary coupling within a feedback-coupled multidisciplinary analysis. For each coupled analysis, this requires a large number of disciplinary high-fidelity simulations to resolve the interactions between different disciplines. When embedded within an uncertainty analysis loop (e.g., with Monte Carlo sampling over uncertain parameters), the number of high-fidelity disciplinary simulations quickly becomes prohibitive, because each sample requires a fixed point iteration and the uncertainty analysis typically involves thousands or even millions of samples. This paper develops a method for uncertainty quantification in feedback-coupled systems that leverage adaptive surrogates to reduce the number of cases for which fixed point iteration is needed. The multifidelity coupled uncertainty propagation method is an iterative process that uses surrogates for approximating the coupling variables and adaptive sampling strategies to refine the surrogates. The adaptive sampling strategies explored in this work are residual error, information gain, and weighted information gain. The surrogate models are adapted in a way that does not compromise the accuracy of the uncertainty analysis relative to the original coupled high-fidelity problem as shown through a rigorous convergence analysis.",56,1

In this paper, a Newton–Krylov optimization algorithm is applied to a set of complex aerodynamic optimization problems in order to investigate its behaviour and performance. The methodology solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with a parallel Newton–Krylov algorithm. Aerodynamic geometries are meshed using structured multiblock grids, which are then fitted with B-spline control volumes for mesh deformation and geometry control. A gradient-based optimization method is used, with adjoint variables calculated using a Krylov method. The optimization of the Common Research Model (CRM) wing is revisited, with a focus on the effect of varying geometric constraints and on the possibility of multimodality. In addition, several cases are presented that involve a high degree of shape change: two planform optimizations starting from a rectangular wing, and investigation of various wingtip treatments. The results characterize the methodology, demonstrating its robustness and ability to address optimization problems with substantial geometric freedom.",56,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056057,"An experimental characterization of the acoustic behavior and the flowfield past several wall-mounted porous fences is presented. Particle image velocimetry is conducted in the near field of the fences. It shows a spanwise periodicity (associated with the periodic geometry of the grid) of regions where well-defined wakes appear as opposed to regions with a lower mass flow rate influenced by strong recirculations. The acoustic behavior is characterized using a microphone array enabling the spatial location of noise sources to be determined. Broadband noise is observed for all grids except for the fractal square grid, where a clear peak appears. The intensity of noise spectra displays scalability with Mach number (dipoles), and the preferential frequency for the fractal square case is shown to scale with the freestream velocity (suggesting a shedding mechanism). For certain grids, the mean and instantaneous spatial locations of the noise sources also present a spanwise preferential arrangement coincident with regions where the flow presents well-defined wakes. Regarding the intermittency of the unsteady sources, they present smaller temporal width, separation, and spatial extent for increasing freestream velocity. However, the ratio between these quantities seems to be constant to within 6% for different Mach numbers.",56,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056023,"The dynamics of a supersonic jet emanating from a high-aspect-ratio rectangular nozzle is investigated using dynamic mode decomposition. In the analysis, dynamic mode decomposition is applied to flowfield data obtained from a large-eddy simulation and the significance of each extracted mode to the snapshot data series is determined using a sparsity-promoting method. Furthermore, in order to assess the validity of the resulting modes, they are compared with the unprocessed large-eddy simulation data in terms of frequency content, sound pressure levels, and space–time correlations. It is found that the accuracy of the modes predicted by the dynamic mode decomposition is sufficient and that the modes deemed as most important give a good representation of the jet flow dynamics. Moreover, the jet flow, at the simulated conditions, is known (from experiments) to be dominated by a screech mechanism. The dynamic mode decomposition methodology, as set up in the present study, is able to isolate the jet screech mode, and the frequency of the extracted mode is in excellent agreement with previous observations.",56,1

The three-dimensional compressible Favre-filtered Navier–Stokes equations in Cartesian form are solved by computational aeroacoustics methods. To handle the complex geometry of two closely spaced circular nozzles, the grid block interface flux reconstruction method for high-order finite difference scheme is used. The supersonic twin jet with fully expanded Mach number 1.358 is simulated in this study. A single jet operating at the same condition is also computed for comparison. It is found that the two coupling jets are both oscillating in flapping mode but out of phase with each other. Therefore the near-field pressure is symmetric about two planes, the midplane separating the two nozzles and the plane involving the two jets’ axes. The computed noise spectra are compared with the experimental data of Walker [“Twin Jet Screech Suppression Concepts Tested for 4.7% Axisymmetric and Two-Dimensional Nozzle Configurations,” AIAA Paper 1990–2150, 1990]. The dominant and first harmonic modes in the twin jet are amplified dramatically comparing with the single jet. An increment of 12 dB for the dominant component is observed, whereas 17 dB for the first harmonic. The predicted amplitudes of the screech tone and its harmonic agree well with the experimental data. Comparing with the single jet, a frequency shift of the screech tone in the twin jet is observed. The pressure field of the jet plumes is analyzed with the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method. The eigenvalues and most energetic eigen-modes are presented. The coupling mechanism of the twin jet is analyzed based on the DMD results. The upstream shift of the DMD modes in the twin jet indicates stronger interactions between the instability waves and the shock cells, which generate stronger tone noise. The stronger interactions in turn alter the shock-cell length and the convective velocity of the instability waves and result in the frequency shift of the screech tone in the twin jet.",56,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055526,"An experimental and computational fluid dynamics study is reported of supersonic jets issuing from a high-aspect-ratio rectangular convergent–divergent nozzle with and without a scarfed exit. Schlieren visualization and laser Doppler anemometry measurements captured near-field aerodynamic development of an unheated jet at overexpanded, design, and underexpanded conditions. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics predictions using an eddy viscosity closure (Spalart–Allmaras model) for clean and scarfed geometries were compared with measurements to examine the ability to capture nozzle scarfing effects. The measured plume shape for a scarfed nozzle was strongly affected at overexpanded conditions (a distorted four-lobe shape was observed), whereas a rectangular shape was retained for underexpanded flow although plume bifurcation occurred. The development of the plume shape and the mixing rate was a consequence of the strong vortices that occur with rectangular nozzles, with extra vortices introduced by scarfing. The nozzle exit static pressure changed dramatically when scarfing was added, influencing plume secondary flows and near-field development. The main features of scarfed jet development were predicted qualitatively correctly; the four-lobe overexpanded shape was reproduced but the strength of pressure-driven secondary velocities was overpredicted. The experimental data provided represent a challenging validation test case for computational fluid dynamics studies of three-dimensional supersonic jet plumes with scarfed interaction effects.",56,1

Nonlinear propagation of the rotor-locked pressure field generated in a turbofan intake duct is calculated by implementing a nonlinear weak-shock theory numerically via a combined time-/frequency-domain algorithm. The aim of the prediction method is to model the nonlinear attenuation and liner absorption of the rotor-locked pressure field within the intake duct. In this hybrid method, the time-domain approach provides a robust and accurate prediction of the nonlinear attenuation, whereas the frequency domain is required to represent the liner attenuation. The focus of this work is to compare the time-/frequency-domain method with time-domain or frequency-domain methods that have been developed previously to calculate the nonlinear propagation of the rotor-locked pressure field in either a rigid or lined intake duct, respectively. The capability of the time-/frequency-domain method to accurately calculate the nonlinear propagation of the rotor-locked pressure field, which can provide an engineering method for buzzsaw noise prediction, is demonstrated.",56,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056166,"To study the duct curvature effects on a shock train in rectangular hypersonic inlet/isolator models, four curved isolators are designed and tested at a freestream Mach number of 4.92. Strong interactions between the shock train and background waves are encountered. In small curvature isolators, the shock train intersects with the left-running or right-running shock stably, with the massive separation situated near the top or bottom wall, respectively; whereas the large separation always locates near the bottom wall in large curvature isolators. When the shock train switches from intersecting with one background shock to another, rapid forward movement occurs in large curvature isolators; whereas violent flow oscillations may appear in small curvature isolators. The radial pressure gradient direction in the shock train region alternatively changes from being centripetal to being centrifugal in small curvature isolators, whereas the direction remains centripetal in large curvature isolators due to the enhanced left-running expansion waves and right-running compression waves. In addition, the amplitude of the radial pressure gradient increases with the duct curvature, which induces significant secondary flow and accumulates a large amount of low-energy fluid near the bottom surface. On the other hand, the streamwise adverse pressure gradient in the shock train decreases with the duct curvature, resulting in a longer and weaker shock train, and the maximum sustainable backpressure ratio decreases with a percentage as high as 17% of that of straight isolator. Besides, the root-mean-square values of static pressure on the exit plane can be reduced to some extent by increasing the duct curvature. In general, large duct curvature has detrimental effects on the shock train characteristics, but adequate duct curvature can help to avoid violent flow oscillation and decrease pressure fluctuating level.",56,1

Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations based on a constant turbulent Prandtl number often give grossly erroneous heat transfer predictions in shock/boundary-layer interaction flows. This is due to the fact that the underlying Morkovin’s hypothesis breaks down in the presence of shock waves; thus, the turbulent Prandtl number cannot be assumed to be a constant. In this paper, a new variable turbulent Prandtl number model based on linearized Rankine–Hugoniot conditions applied to shock–turbulence interaction is developed. The turbulent Prandtl number is a function of the shock strength, and a shock function is proposed to identify the location and strength of shock waves. The shock function also simulates the postshock relaxation of the turbulent heat flux, which is akin to that observed in canonical shock–turbulence interaction. The model is combined with the well-validated shock-unsteadiness model and is applied to the complex shock topology observed in oblique shock/turbulent boundary-layer interactions. Comparison with experimental data shows significant improvement in the surface heat transfer rate in the interaction region, both for attached and separated shock/boundary-layer interaction cases. The shock function is also used to propose a robust form of the existing shock-unsteadiness model that simplifies the numerical implementation enormously.",56,1

Experimental schlieren images were compared with the wave patterns obtained from numerical simulations, showing good agreement. The shock interaction in the crotch region creates a very complex flow-field and an uneven distribution of the surface heat flux. An extremely high heat flux caused by a shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction, a shear layer attachment, or an impingement of the supersonic jets occurs over a narrow region. The numerical results indicate that the local surface heat flux can be up to 24 times the stagnation-point value computed using the Fay–Riddell correlation. Moreover, increasing the leading edge bluntness may have a significant negative effect on the thermal protection of the crotch caused by the shock interaction. Designing a hypersonic V-shaped leading edge involves a compromise between making the leading edge sharp enough to avoid a complex shock interaction flow and blunt enough to reduce the stagnation-point heat flux.",56,1

In this paper the influence of the helicopter configuration on its electrification is reported. The current study is based on a recently developed numerical approach in which the turbulent airflow around the rotorcraft is estimated via large-eddy simulations, whereas the particulate flow is computed via Lagrangian particle tracking. Also, this approach incorporates a model for the triboelectric charge transfer during particle–helicopter collisions that is briefly described herein. The configurations examined in the study include rotor systems equipped with two, three, or four blades. Also investigated are the effects of the rotor size and its rotational frequency. The current results predict that a helicopter with fewer blades accumulates less electric current, even though the charge on each individual blade is higher. Furthermore, the location of the charge buildup on the rotor disk depends strongly on the number of blades. Also, according to current computations, a reduction of the rotor size leads to a reduction of its electrification, even if the blade tip velocity is kept constant.",56,1

Instead of ordinary algebraic polynomials, the Legendre polynomials, which are mathematically orthonormal, are used as admissible functions. The present analysis is based upon the circular cylindrical coordinates, whereas toroidal coordinates have been used in general. The potential and kinetic energies of the torus are formulated, and upper bound values of the frequencies are obtained by minimizing the frequencies. Convergence to a four-digit exactitude is demonstrated for the first five frequencies of the torus. Comparisons are made between the frequencies from the present three-dimensional method, a two-dimensional thin-shell theory, and thin- and thick-ring theories. The present method is applicable to very thick shells as well as thin shells.",56,1
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055960,"The paper presents analyses that were performed with the EZNSS flow solver for the second Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop. The reference test cases for the Aeroelastic Prediction Workshop are based on two wind-tunnel experiments of the Benchmark Supercritical Wing, including a flutter test and forced excitation tests. Three cases are addressed at different transonic flow conditions: two cases at lower Mach numbers of 0.7 and 0.74 and 3 and 0 deg angles of attack, respectively; and one more physically complex case at Mach 0.85 and a 5 deg angle of attack. The cases are analyzed with the EZNSS code, using several computational setups and turbulence models. The simulations are able to predict relatively accurately the flutter response and the response to prescribed motion at the lower Mach number. The higher-Mach-number case, which involves a strong shock, separated flow behind the shock, and some flow unsteadiness, is more challenging. In the static analysis, different turbulence models yield different upper-surface shock positions, and none of the models are able to capture accurately the pressure recovery behind the shock. However, the unsteady aerodynamic response to prescribed pitch motion is simulated with good correlation to the wind-tunnel data. The paper also presents flutter predictions based on unsteady aerodynamic reduced-order modeling, thus validating and assessing the efficiency of the reduced-order modeling and the flutter prediction methodology.",56,1

Considering the higher-order effect of residual modes that are simply truncated in the Craig–Bampton method, the original finite element model can be more accurately reduced. In this formulation, unknown eigenvalues are considered as additional generalized coordinates, which can be eliminated by employing the concept of system equivalent reduction expansion process. The new component mode synthesis is named the higher-order Craig–Bampton method. The formulation of the higher-order Craig–Bampton method is presented, and its improved accuracy is demonstrated through various examples.",56,1

The sandwich beam is considered symmetric, with identical top and bottom facesheets. Only a pure moment loading is considered. The -integral coupled with laminate beam theory is employed to derive closed-form expression for the energy release rate in terms of the applied moments, geometry, and material properties. A scalar quantity is obtained to express the mode-mixity phase angle. It is shown that is independent of the applied loading conditions. The value of is found to be moderately influenced by reinforcement thicknesses.",56,1
