0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054590,"A theory based upon linearized governing equations is developed that describes the operation principles and design parameters for low-speed wind tunnels with longitudinal freestream oscillations. Existing measurements made in unsteady wind tunnels are shown to be consistent with the theory and targeted validation experiments performed in a variable-geometry blowdown-type wind tunnel revealed excellent correspondence with the theoretical results. In particular, the tunnel frequency bandwidth is proportional to the mean tunnel freestream velocity and inversely proportional to the test-section length and the square of the exit area to test-section area ratio. The acoustics equations reveal a “Helmholtz damping ratio” that is not only dependent on the tunnel geometry and exit area but also proportional to the freestream Mach number. At appreciable reduced frequencies, dynamic stall on the louver vanes increases pressure losses, thereby reducing the mean flow speeds. Varying the exit area results in louver-vane vortex shedding that can excite resonances, resulting in an apparent increase in the turbulence level. To achieve large freestream amplitudes and high-frequency bandwidths, substantial blockage, and therefore pressure losses, will be incurred; thus, large increases in the tunnel power factor should be anticipated.",54,6
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052694,"The results presented herein include SparkJet characterization studies with a focus on understanding the actuator efficiency during stage 1 and the resulting flowfield. Experimental cavity pressure and arc power measurements are used to estimate efficiency whereas experimental microschlieren images are used to visualize the flowfield and quantify the velocity of distinct flow features. The experimental measurements used to estimate efficiency during stage 1 of a single SparkJet cycle were acquired using a single orifice SparkJet design in a quiescent environment. The experiments evaluated efficiency as a function of cavity volume , orifice diameter (0.4–2.0 mm), and input energy (0.17–0.77 J per pulse). The results show that efficiency is a function of parasitic resistance in circuit components, high-temperature gas dynamics, and the ratio of input energy to internal energy of the cavity air, . The circuit design used here was approximately 80% efficient and the pressure-based efficiency decreased from 40 to 20% as increased from 5 to 60. Adjusting the pressure-based efficiency calculation to be a function of the measured arc energy, the conversion from arc energy to the energy available to raise the cavity pressure was 40–45% efficient. Using a SparkJet four-orifice array design (cavity volume of and each orifice 0.4 mm in diameter) in a quiescent environment, phase-averaged microschlieren images of a single SparkJet cycle reveal the rapid flow development when the first evidence of flow is seen after the SparkJet initiation and a well-developed jet is visible by . Also based on these calibrated images, the maximum jet velocity was estimated at .",54,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054298,"Edney type IV and type VII shock–shock interactions are complex hypersonic flow phenomena. They are characterized by a supersonic jet that reaches far into the flowfield. An experimental investigation of the inner jet structure is difficult, especially in cases where the jet is subject to high-frequency unsteady movements. The present paper provides insight into the jet structure and its movement by means of a highly resolved computational fluid dynamics analysis in thermochemical nonequilibrium that significantly exceeds the resolution of existing publications. Simulations of an Edney type IV interaction in nitrogen flow are presented. Advanced adaptation strategies allow for the identification and analysis of the mechanisms of the jet unsteadiness, resulting in a new classification of the unsteady flowfield behavior with respect to the periodic jet movement. This classification is based not only on wall quantities, but also on the core flowfield. The computations are supplemented by a grid sensitivity study. The second configuration is an Edney type VII interaction. This shock–shock interaction type was observed and defined in nitrogen flow by Yamamoto et al (Numerical Investigation of Shock/Vortex Interaction in Hypersonic Thermochemical Nonequilibrium Flow, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets, Vol. 36, No. 2, 1999, pp. 240–246. The present results demonstrate that this interaction may also be observed in carbon-dioxide-dominated flow with a gas composition similar to the Martian atmosphere. The results provide insight into the jet structure of this less known interaction.",54,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053905,"The relationship between the three-dimensional vortex structures and flow-separation zones generated by a shock wave/boundary-layer interaction within a low-aspect-ratio duct was studied using stereoscopic particle imaging velocimetry measurements. In this configuration, the interaction of the incident shock with all walls was important in controlling the flowfield; the three interactions coupled to produce a strongly distorted flowfield. Conditional sampling was used to construct the local probability of reverse flow maps, and thus quantify the distribution of regions of intermittent separation on both bottom-walls and side-walls. The latter regions were found to be significantly larger and more likely to separate than the former. Thus, it was concluded that the sidewall and corner flow interactions dominate in this configuration. A triple decomposition of motion was used to construct a three-dimensional representation of the vortex features generated by the interaction. The results indicated that the flowfield was dominated by three vortex systems: 1) the vortex associated with the sidewall swept-shock interaction; 2) a complex, possibly branched, vortex pair induced on the bottom wall; and 3) a vortex pair induced by the flow at the corner, which coupled the two interactions. The role of the three vortex systems on the onset of flow separation was also explored and discussed.",54,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054287,"During Busemann intake design, two constraints have to be considered. First, caused by the displacement of the boundary layer, the pressure levels in a Busemann intake were higher than the values predicted analytically; these effects were labeled viscous effects. Second, truncating the flowfield also changed the properties of the classical Busemann flow; these effects were labeled truncation effects, and it can be distinguished between truncating the intake at the leading edge and at the rear side. To take into account viscous effects, the boundary-layer displacement thickness was calculated with an integral method and added to the inviscid Busemann contour. To quantify leading-edge truncation effects, an oblique shock at the leading edge was assumed, and the pressure at the intake exit was corrected with the continuity equation. The change in flow properties during the rear-side truncation was calculated with a stream-thrust analysis. The effects were separately investigated with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and Euler simulations, respectively. After the viscous correction, the deviation between numerically and analytically calculated pressure level was below 10%. When truncating the intake, the numerically calculated average pressure and temperature levels were within 1% of the analytical values.",54,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054610,"In this study, the mean flow organization ahead and behind a supercritical cylindrical roughness element immersed in an incoming laminar boundary layer at edge Mach number 6.48 is investigated by means of schlieren visualization, infrared thermography, and planar particle image velocimetry. The schlieren images provide a general overview of the shock-wave system developing around the roughness element. The surface heat transfer map obtained with infrared thermography provides an overall description of the near-wall flow organization in the streamwise and spanwise directions. The off-surface flow topology is inspected with particle image velocimetry in the symmetry plane of the recirculation region upstream of the roughness element. The flow approaching the roughness element separates, forming a main recirculation region adjacent to the stagnation line at the cylinder leading edge. The reattachment vortex is responsible for a heat flux local peak in front of the protuberance. Secondary, more complex local foci and stagnation points are observed upstream of the roughness element, which also correspond to the local maximum of turbulent kinetic energy and surface heat transfer.",54,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054484,"The interaction of an isolated trailing vortex and the ground is investigated. An unsteady unperturbed flow is first calculated through a two-dimensional direct numerical simulation and then used as base flow for linear transient growth studies. The transient growth increases with Reynolds number and maximizes at streamwise wave number over the parameters considered. The most energetic initial perturbation is found to be located aside of the main vortex and convected by the base flow to the ground to interact with the separating boundary layer and the secondary vortex. Finally, the calculated perturbation is used to perturb the base flow in three-dimensional direct numerical simulation. It is observed that the secondary vortex and the rebound motion of the main vortex are both significantly suppressed. This observation indicates that the secondary structures are sensitive to external noise, and the widely reported secondary vortex and its induced rebound motion of the main vortex in two-dimensional direct numerical simulation would not appear or become much weaker in real conditions.",54,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054756,"Far-field drag extraction has the advantage over near-field integration of providing a phenomenological breakdown of drag. A decomposition into components linked to shock waves, viscous interactions, and lift-induced vortices is straightforward for steady flows. A formulation based on thermodynamic considerations is used at ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab and by its partners, but it is restricted to steady cases. A generalization to unsteady flows of the Van der Vooren formulation has been developed and tested on three unsteady cases previously. The proposed method allowed the breakdown of drag into the three usual components only; however, the induced drag coefficient remained ill-defined. This unsteady formulation is here modified to better express the induced drag. A new drag component is identified as a propagation and acoustics contribution. The new formulation is then applied to complex cases: two-dimensional and three-dimensional pitching cases, and an OAT15A profile subject to buffet simulated by zonal detached-eddy simulation computations.",54,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054687,"An analytical acoustic vector formulation is meaningful to visualize acoustic energy radiating from sources and to predict sound scattered by surfaces. This paper presents a vector wave equation of aeroacoustics, which is an exact rearrangement of the continuity and momentum equations, by following the idea of the acoustic analogy. Based on the vector wave equation, an alternative method is proposed to deduce the acoustic velocity formulations for thickness and loading sources. Moreover, both the time-domain and frequency-domain acoustic velocity formulations for the quadrupole source are deduced as well. The formulation solved by the time-domain numerical method is suitable for the quadrupole source in arbitrary motion, whereas the formulation related to the frequency-domain numerical method is valid for the rotating source. A numerical test case is carried out to validate the proposed acoustic velocity formulations for the quadrupole source. Up to now, all the time-domain and frequency-domain acoustic pressure and acoustic velocity formulations for the thickness, loading, and quadrupole sources have been developed, indicating that both the acoustic scalar and vector quantities can be computed directly by employing the acoustic analogy. Further research on the acoustic vector is discussed as well.",54,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054563,"A novel approach for the accurate prediction of launch environment acoustic physics is presented. Launch vehicles experience extreme acoustic loads during liftoff, driven by the interaction of rocket plumes and plume-generated acoustic waves with ground structures. In this work, a well-established hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation unstructured mesh solver is used to efficiently model the complex turbulent plume physics, and a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin solver is used to accurately propagate acoustic waves across large distances throughout the launch environment. The two solvers operate on separate overlapping meshes, and an innovative overset coupling approach is used to transmit the plume-generated acoustics to the far field in a one-way manner in which the turbulent plume prediction is unaffected by the outer acoustic propagation physics. The framework upon which the solvers are developed is described along with details outlining the overset domain connectivity and interpolation methods. Results are presented that demonstrate the accuracy of the capability for aeroacoustic predictions, and the merits of the approach are evaluated using a notional space launch system launch environment in which rocket plumes are represented by transient acoustic sources.",54,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054685,"Nitrous-oxide emissions and the equivalence ratio resulting in lean extinction of two adjacent gas turbine fuel/air nozzles are measured as the spacing between the two nozzles is varied. Two swirl-stabilized nozzle types are tested: a high-stability pilot design, and a low-emission design with a much lower swirl number. Jet A is used as the fuel. The lean blowout point is tested for both nozzle types at each spacing. Increased spacing results in blowout at a lower equivalence ratio, which is likely due to increased air velocity between the nozzles that occurs at closer spacings. The spacing has a dramatic effect on the nitrous-oxide emissions index (grams of nitrous-oxide produced per kilogram of fuel burned) for the three possible nozzle combinations. The nitrous-oxide index emissions are greatest when two nozzles are placed close, and they decrease as the internozzle distance grows. The excited hydroxyl radical (OH)* chemiluminescence imaging shows how the OH* intensity is greater on the side of the nozzles toward the neighboring flame. This is an indication that the heat release rate and/or temperature is raised in part of the flame due to the adjacent nozzle. The magnitude of the effects of nozzle spacing, both on emissions and lean blowout, are dependent on the nozzle design. Asymmetries in the flow and flame structure of the two nozzles appear when using two high-swirl pilot nozzles at larger nozzle spacings. This disturbs the emissions trend and causes an increase in nitrous-oxide production for this case.",54,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053384,"This article presents results of numerical simulations of the High Reynolds Number Aero Structural Dynamics wind tunnel configuration. The activities consist of the selection of relevant transonic test cases, the setup and simulation of the numerical models, and the comparison of computational and experimental results. Two steady (static coupling) and three unsteady (forced motion) test cases were selected, all in the transonic flow regime at Mach numbers up to 0.85 and Reynolds numbers up to 23 million. Good agreement between numerical and experimental data was obtained for both the steady and the unsteady test cases. It is shown that the consideration of the static elastic deformation of the wing is indispensable for both the steady and unsteady simulations. The unsteady simulations were executed in such a way that the elastic motion of the wing in a selected structural eigenmode was prescribed in a forced motion computational fluid dynamics simulation using grid deformation. This approach yields very satisfactory results in terms of the unsteady pressure distribution.",54,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054582,"This paper describes an effort toward characterizing the role of material plasticity on the structural response and operational life of compliant panels in high-speed flow. A fluid–thermal–structural–material interactions framework is used to investigate the response of elastic and elastic-plastic panels subjected to multiple loading cycles. The plastic material response is predicted using a nonlinear strain hardening law that accounts for cyclic loading. A fatigue analysis is conducted using a linear cumulative damage rule. A residual deformation on the order of one panel thickness is found to produce characteristically different responses for elastic and plastic panels. After several loading cycles, the onset of flutter for the permanently deformed panel increased beyond the time responses considered.",54,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054576,"This paper proposes a numerical approach to estimate the dynamic behavior of a typical aeronautical aluminum box-beam structure liable to buckling. The methodology is based on a nonlinear finite element model and an experimental modal analysis procedure. The finite element model deals with the coupled nonlinear static and dynamic problems in two steps: 1) determining the static equilibrium considering geometrical nonlinearities, and 2) solving for a linear small-amplitude free-vibration problem based on the tangential stiffness matrix from the current static equilibrium. To illustrate the proposed method, a finite element model is built for a simple supported box beam under a uniaxial compression load with different degrees of eccentricity. The numerical results are correlated with an experimental modal analysis procedure in pre- and postbuckling regimes. Based on this comparison, an updated model is proposed for adjusting the shape and magnitude of the initial imperfections based on linear buckling modes. The results are presented in order to illustrate the effect of the buckling phenomenon and initial imperfections on the dynamic behavior of the box-beam structure.",54,6
