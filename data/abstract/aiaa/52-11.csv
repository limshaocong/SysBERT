0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052682,"The theoretical foundations are formulated for extraction of skin-friction fields from surface mass-transfer visualizations with pressure-sensitive paint and sublimating coatings. The asymptotic form of the mass transport equation at a wall is expressed as the optical flow equation in the image plane. Then, a relative skin-friction field is obtained by solving the optical flow equation as an inverse problem via the variational method. For steady-state visualizations with pressure-sensitive paint and sublimating coatings, a relative skin-friction field can be obtained from a single normalized intensity image. Further, a superposition procedure of a snapshot solution and a variation solution associated with the unsteady effect is proposed to reconstruct an unsteady skin-friction field from a time sequence of pressure-sensitive paint visualization images. The capability of the proposed method is examined by applying it to pressure-sensitive paint visualizations in impinging nitrogen jets. This method is also used to extract skin-friction fields from sublimation visualization images on a delta wing in a low-speed flow and on a flat surface in fin shock/boundary-layer interaction at Mach 6. The skin-friction topology in these cases is revealed by using this method. In addition, the limitations of this method are discussed.",52,11

The results yield a mathematical framework that can be used to estimate the aerodynamic damping coefficient throughout the entire pitch cycle. The analysis is then applied to experimental data from attached, light, and deep dynamic stall conditions at freestream Mach numbers ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 and Reynolds numbers up to . The Hilbert-transform-based approach is used to demonstrate that the cycle-integrated aerodynamic damping coefficient masks the physics underlying the stabilizing and destabilizing mechanisms of the dynamic stall process. In particular, conditions that exhibit positive cycle-integrated aerodynamic damping may include time intervals of negative aerodynamic damping during the pitch cycle.",52,11
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052820,"One of the primary challenges in the development of high-speed systems is accurate and efficient prediction of the aerodynamic heating, particularly for lightweight systems where there is a potential for strong coupling between the aerothermodynamic loads and the structural response. A novel approach is developed that corrects heat flux predictions from a pointwise dependency on surface temperature in order to account for surface temperature gradients. This enables efficient construction of a computational fluid dynamics surrogate for aerodynamic heating without a priori assumptions on the surface temperature profile while also accurately maintaining the critical feedback behavior of the surface temperature profile for a coupled fluid–thermal–structural analysis. The method is compared, in terms of accuracy and efficiency, with a hierarchy of approaches for aerodynamic heating prediction. Comparison cases include simple flat-plate heating, as well as shock impingements in two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows. Typically, the approach yields less than 6% error relative to full-order computational fluid dynamics predictions, and it clearly outperforms all other simple prediction methods in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, it maintains excellent computational efficiency, enabling long-time-record fluid–thermal–structural analysis in complex three-dimensional flow environments.",52,11
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052732,"Formulating conceptual-stage aircraft design problems as geometric programs, which are a specific type of convex optimization problem, is proposed. Recent advances in convex optimization offer significant advantages over the general nonlinear optimization methods typically used in aircraft design. Modern geometric program solvers are extremely fast (even on large problems), require no initial guesses or tuning of solver parameters, and guarantee globally optimal solutions. These benefits come at a price: all objective and constraint functions, the mathematical models that describe aircraft design relations, must be expressed within the restricted functional forms of geometric programs. Perhaps surprisingly, this restricted set of functional forms appears again and again in prevailing physics-based models for aircraft systems. Moreover, it is shown that, for various models that cannot be manipulated algebraically into the forms required by geometric programs, compact geometric program models that accurately approximate the original models can often be fit. The speed and reliability of geometric program solution methods makes them a promising approach for conceptual-stage aircraft design problems.",52,11
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052858,"Dynamic mode decomposition is applied to investigate the unsteady flowfield around a pitching airfoil. The extracted flow structures are termed as dynamic mode decomposition modes. Analyses are performed for both attached flow and dynamic stall cases. Initially, flowfield data generated from numerical simulations are investigated. The effect of exclusion of the flowfield near the surface of the airfoil on the structure of the dynamic mode decomposition modes is examined. This is of vital importance for the experimental measurements, as the flowfield near the airfoil’s surface is difficult to measure using particle image velocimetry. In the latter part of the paper, dynamic mode decomposition modes extracted from the experimental data are analyzed. The structure of these modes are compared with the modes obtained from the proper orthogonal decomposition technique. Finally, effects of phase averaging on the modes are discussed.",52,11
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052887,"Application of aerodynamic flow control to the vertical tail of an aircraft could enable significant decrease in its size, with corresponding reductions in drag, weight, and fuel costs. Wind-tunnel experiments at a Reynolds number of 350,000 were conducted on a sweptback tapered vertical tail capable of sideslip rotation. The model used in the present work was approximately th scale with a NACA 0012 airfoil section. It was instrumented with an array of finite-span synthetic jet actuators distributed along the span, just upstream of the rudder hingeline. When the synthetic jets were activated, the side force coefficient was increased by a maximum of 0.17 (34%) over the baseline vertical tail. A primary objective of this work was to explore the effect of the orientation, location, and geometry of the synthetic jet orifices on control effectiveness. The parameters under investigation were orifice aspect ratio, spacing between adjacent orifice edges, the chordwise jet location, spanwise location, skew angle, and spanwise actuator density. This set of experiments suggested that the actuators’ spanwise spacing can be too dense (that is, maintaining constant individual jet strength and reducing the spanwise density of active actuators such that the total area-based momentum decreased, did not have a detrimental effect on side force enhancement for some conditions). The relative importance of other parameters that are typically used to quantify synthetic jet strength was also analyzed; the area-based momentum coefficient was determined to be a much more dominant factor than the blowing ratio and chord-based momentum coefficient.",52,11
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052890,"Complex interactions in fiber-reinforced composites between multiple failure mechanisms have made accurate failure prediction a daunting challenge. One approach to better identify failure mechanisms has been the use of volume average constituent stresses in the composite to predict the onset and outcome of failure in individual constituents. However, this approach was shown here to not conserve strain energy in the composite, which could potentially affect the accuracy of failure prediction under certain loading conditions. The focus of this work was to develop an expression for the discrepancy in strain energy, termed the interaction energy, and to numerically evaluate the influence of constituent properties, fiber volume fraction, and load combinations on the magnitude of this energy. The simulation results showed that interaction energy accounts for nearly 30% of the total strain energy in the composite for certain loading conditions in typical aerospace-grade carbon-epoxy composites, suggesting that existing constituent-based failure theories might be enhanced by incorporation of this energy into failure criteria.",52,11
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052864,"An experimental study was conducted to investigate the pressure fluctuations on the entire sidewall of a rectangular cavity with an of 5.67 using fast-response pressure-sensitive paint. Additionally, the performance of four different passive flow-control devices was quantified. Experiments were conducted in the Trisonic Gasdynamics Facility at the Air Force Research Laboratory at Mach 0.7 and 1.5. The frequency spectrum (including Rossiter tones) and sound pressure levels obtained from the pressure-sensitive paint measurements are validated against data taken with conventional dynamic pressure sensors. The complex flow phenomena over the cavity wall were visualized, and full-wall pressure spectra were calculated. The rod in crossflow showed the best peak suppression, followed closely by the flat spoiler. The large triangular steps showed moderate peak suppression, whereas the ridges did not suppress the peaks at all. High-resolution measurements of both temporal and spatial pressure fluctuations on the wall allowed for the visualization of sound pressure level distribution over the entire cavity wall. This revealed a strong dependence between the Rossiter tone modes and the spatial distribution of sound pressure levels that was not possible to resolve with traditional discrete pressure transducers.",52,11
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052850,"It is known that imperfectly expanded supersonic jets undergoing strong screech emit not only the fundamental screech tone but also multiple tones at the harmonics of the fundamental frequency. The dominant direction of radiation of the fundamental screech tone is in the upstream direction toward the nozzle exit. This is necessary to complete the feedback loop responsible for the generation of the screech tone. The harmonic tones, however, do not generally radiate in the same direction as the fundamental. For the th harmonic screech tone, there are distinct beams of radiation. Many of these beams are radiated in the sideline and downstream directions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the generation mechanism of the screech harmonics. It is proposed that the screech tone harmonics are produced by Mach wave radiation from supersonic traveling waves in the jet flow. These supersonic traveling waves are created by the interaction of the nonlinear instability wave of the jet flow and the shock-cell structure in the jet plume as well as by nonlinear wave–wave interaction. Based on the proposed generation mechanism, a formula is derived for the principal directions of radiation of the screech tone harmonics. The agreement of these predicted principal directions of radiation with the experimental measurements of Norum is used to validate the proposed tone generation mechanism.",52,11
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052849,"This paper describes a method for defining a coordinate system to parameterize a sampled Pareto frontier of a continuous multi-attribute design problem using a modified self-organizing map. By defining such a coordinate system, the design problem may be reformulated from to , where is a vector of design variables, is a vector of attributes, and is a vector of barycentric coordinates. Exploration of the design problem using as the independent variables has the following desirable properties: 1) Every vector corresponds to a Pareto efficient design, and every Pareto efficient design has a corresponding . 2) The number of coordinates is equal to the number of attributes, regardless of the number of design variables. 3) Each attribute has a corresponding coordinate such that the sign of is positive if the objective is to maximize and negative if the objective is to minimize (i.e., the attributes improve monotonically as their corresponding coordinates increase). This approach, named the “Pareto simplex self-organizing map” is easily implemented as a postprocessing step to sampling a Pareto frontier with multi-objective optimization. The construction of the coordinates and their use in design space exploration is demonstrated on a conceptual wing design problem.",52,11
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052903,"An active-flow-control study, using steady suction-and-oscillatory-blowing actuators, was conducted on an axisymmetric bluff-body model for a range of Reynolds numbers between and . Previous work on the same model demonstrated the experimental implementation and efficient drag reduction of the suction-and-oscillatory-blowing actuator system, including comparisons to computational fluid dynamics results. The current study presents a detailed analysis of the experimental data, coupled with a refined computational model toward a flow-physics understanding of the drag-reduction mechanisms of the suction-and-oscillatory-blowing active-flow-control system. The boundary-layer response was examined using time-averaged and phase-averaged hot-wire measurements conducted on the aft portion of the model where active flow control was applied. The drag-reduction behavior was scaled using multiple active-flow-control parameters associated with the unique and complex features of the suction-and-oscillatory-blowing active-flow-control system. The results show that the drag-reduction mechanisms associated with the suction-and-oscillatory-blowing actuation system include boundary-layer suction, wall-jet momentum addition, unsteady shear-layer excitation, the generation of thrust, and streamwise vortices.",52,11
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052905,"A new laminar–turbulent transition model for low-turbulence external aerodynamic applications is presented that incorporates linear stability theory in a manner compatible with modern computational fluid dynamics solvers. The model uses a new transport equation that describes the growth of the maximum Tollmien–Schlichting instability amplitude in the presence of a boundary layer. To avoid the need for integration paths and nonlocal operations, a locally defined nondimensional pressure-gradient parameter is used that serves as an estimator of the integral boundary-layer properties. The model has been implemented into the OVERFLOW 2.2f solver. Comparisons of predictions using the new model with high-quality wind-tunnel measurements of airfoil section characteristics confirm the predictive qualities of the model, as well as its improvement over the current state of the art in computational fluid dynamics transition modeling at approximately half the computational expense.",52,11
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052758,"Combustion instabilities characterized by large-amplitude self-sustained oscillations are detrimental to gas-turbine and aeroengine systems. To mitigate these unwanted oscillations, a dynamic actuator is generally implemented. In this work, combustion instability in a bifurcating tube with a loudspeaker implemented is investigated. The bifurcating system is different from conventional Rijke-type and T-shaped ones. It can produce nonharmonic “hot” and “cold” oscillating flows, which provides a useful platform to aid experimental research and teaching on combustion instability. To monitor the flow and acoustic fields in the bifurcating branches, two arrays of pressure sensors and an infrared thermal-imaging camera are implemented. When the loudspeaker attached near the open end of the bottom stem is not actuated, the tube is corresponding to an open-loop thermoacoustic system. To gain insights on the distinguishing characteristics of the flow and acoustic fields, two-dimensional numerical simulations and experimental measurement of the open-loop system are conducted first. Comparison is then made between the numerical and experimental results. Good agreement is obtained in terms of mode frequencies, mode shapes, and sound pressure level. Describing function analysis is then conducted to predict the limit-cycle frequency and amplitude. Finally, the loudspeaker is actuated via a multi-input/single-output tuning strategy to minimize the combustion oscillations. It is shown that actuating the loudspeaker results in the combustion system being stabilized via reducing the sound pressure level by approximately 45 dB, even when the fuel flow rate is slightly changed.",52,11
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052869,"The wall-temperature effects on the behavior of a shock-induced separation at Mach number 2.3 are experimentally investigated. Schlieren visualizations, velocity measurements with particle image velocimetry, and time-resolved hot-wire measurements are used to describe how the wall temperature influences the length and timescales of the interaction. It is shown that heating has a large influence on the size and on the low-frequency unsteadiness of the interaction, but influences only slightly the onset of the separation. Models, initially proposed to describe adiabatic shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction, are shown to be effective to obtain similarities for the length and timescales between the heated and adiabatic interactions considered at the same external conditions, as long as the heating effects on the friction coefficient are taken into account. Comparisons with cooled interactions at similar external conditions are also given.",52,11
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052922,"Aerodynamic shape optimization of aircraft configurations often ignores stability considerations. To address this, a method for the computation of static, dynamic, and transient aircraft stability derivatives and their sensitivities for use in gradient-based optimization is introduced and evaluated. Computational fluid dynamics in the form of a three-dimensional structured-grid multiblock flow solver with both Euler and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations is used. To compute the stability derivatives, a time-spectral formulation is used to compute an oscillating solution for the configuration of interest. From this oscillating solution, a series of linear regressions is performed to calculate the various stability derivatives. Because the solution is time dependent, it contains the information required to compute the transient, or “dot,” derivatives for the configuration. An adjoint method is used to compute the gradients of the stability derivatives of interest, enabling gradient-based stability-constrained aerodynamic shape optimization with respect to a large number of design variables. The computed stability derivatives are verified for an airfoil and validated for a generic unmanned combat aerial vehicle. The stability-constrained optimization of a wing demonstrates the viability and usefulness of the method for aircraft design optimization.",52,11
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052941,"This work investigates the effect of two-dimensional surface deformations on hypersonic boundary-layer stability. The deformations are obtained from previous research and represent the characteristic response of integrated thermal protection system panels due to combined aerodynamic and thermal loading. Boundary-layer stability is assessed using linear stability theory and the parabolized stability equations for several different cases, such as deformation direction, deformation location, multiple deformations in series, structural boundary condition, surface temperature, the combined effect of Mach number and altitude, and deformation-mode shape. The broad set of results provides important insight into the conditions where thermomechanical compliance can promote, or even possibly delay, hypersonic boundary-layer transition.",52,11
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052948,"A recently proposed modification to fully compressible schemes significantly improves the resolution of low-Mach-number features, tackling the problem of excessive numerical dissipation as the Mach number reduces. This paper explores the application of this modification to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations using second- and fifth-order in-space schemes. Following verification of the modeling approach, four test cases are employed to highlight the scheme performance, including a backward-facing step, a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the NACA 4412 airfoil (incorporating a trailing-edge separation), and finally a Mach 2.25 oblique shock-wave–boundary-layer interaction. It demonstrates first that the converged solution is grid- and scheme-independent, as expected, and that the low-Mach-number correction provides a significant improvement in low-Mach-number regions. Because this correction is easy to implement, computationally inexpensive, and stable, the conclusion is that it should be recommended for all existing Godunov-type Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solvers.",52,11
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052909,"Experiments were made for flow over a smooth circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers of , relevant to the initial transition from the subcritical to critical regimes. Pressure measurements on the circular cylinder show that at a fixed flow speed, two bistable states are observed. Further data analysis indicates that the characteristics of these two states, named states A and B, respectively, are distinctly different. Whereas state B is identified as the subcritical state, state A shows flow characteristics toward the critical regime, namely, a higher base pressure, a more unsteady vortex-shedding frequency, a lower Strouhal number, and a greater fluctuating energy in low-frequency components. The microelectrical mechanical system thermal-tuft measurements on the circular cylinder show that state A represents a situation in which separation bubbles are situated symmetrically on the two sides of the circular cylinder. The separation bubbles induce pronounced unsteadiness in the flow and tend to move upstream as the Reynolds number increases.",52,11

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052974,"This work is an experimental and computational investigation of acoustics and performance of a biconical and splined supersonic nozzle to identify the dependencies of noise components on the nozzle design. The convergent section and throat of a biconical supersonic nozzle were optimized with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver to optimize thrust and minimize internal losses. Far-field acoustics and the jet flowfield were measured and studied using large-eddy simulations at design, overexpanded, and underexpanded conditions. The biconical and splined nozzles are designed to be thrust matched at fully expanded conditions. The convergent section and throat contour do not significantly affect the turbulent mixing noise or shock-associated noise at most conditions. Analysis of the jet flowfield shows differences in shock structure, although the “global” shock strength remains relatively unchanged. A comparison of measurements and computations of mean velocity and turbulence shows minor differences in the shear-layer region and near strong shocks. Momentum thrust and pressure thrust were measured and compared with computational results. The contoured throat nozzle provides equivalent thrust with a 4% lower nozzle pressure ratio at the design condition with no acoustic penalty. At equivalent nozzle pressure ratios, the contoured nozzle provides 10% higher thrust with no increase in mixing noise or shock noise.",52,11
