0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052420,"Two methods that explicitly model airfoil geometry surface deviations for mistuning prediction in integrally bladed rotors are developed by performing a modal analysis on different degrees of freedom of a parent reduced-order model. The parent reduced-order model is formulated with Craig–Bampton component-mode synthesis in cyclic symmetry coordinates for an integrally bladed rotor with a tuned disk and airfoil geometric deviations. The first method performs an eigenanalysis on the constraint-mode degrees of freedom that provides a truncated set of interface modes, whereas the second method includes the disk fixed-interface normal mode in the eigenanalysis to yield a truncated set of ancillary modes. Both methods can use tuned or mistuned modes, where the tuned modes have the computational benefit of being computed in cyclic symmetry coordinates. Furthermore, the tuned modes only need to be calculated once, which offers significant computational savings for subsequent mistuning studies. Each geometric mistuning method relies upon the use of geometrically mistuned airfoil modes in the component-mode framework to provide a very accurate reduced-order model. Free and forced response results are compared to both the full finite-element model solutions and a traditional frequency-based approach used widely in academia and the gas-turbine industry. It is shown that the developed methods provide highly accurate results with a significant reduction in solution time compared to the full finite-element model and parent reduced-order model.",52,7
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052481,"This paper presents a computational investigation of the hysteretic buzz characteristics of a supersonic inlet under a complete historic path of a mass flow change. It is observed that the amplitude and frequency of inlet buzz suddenly change in spite of the gradual variation in the mass flow rate. Furthermore, inlet buzz is found to exhibit quite different behavior depending on the historic path of the mass flow rate change, which leads to the hysteretic inlet buzz phenomenon. To investigate the hysteretic characteristics of inlet buzz and to provide a physical explanation of such a phenomenon, a series of numerical simulations are performed with the following three stages. First, an inlet without a center body is calculated to validate the flow solver and basic resonance mode results. Second, an inlet under a decreasing mass flow rate condition is simulated. Last, the effect of an increasing mass flow rate on inlet buzz is examined. Through computations, multiple inlet buzz transitions from fundamental to higher buzz modes are obtained, in accordance with previous experimental observations. The three sets of the computed results are compared and discussed from the viewpoint of acoustics to explain the physical mechanism of the hysteretic buzz characteristics and the buzz transition phenomenon.",52,7

Correlations are obtained for the windward and centerline spray trajectories in terms of the principal variables, such as crossflow and liquid jet velocities and gas and liquid physical properties, as well as a function of pertinent nondimensional numbers (i.e., liquid to crossflow air momentum ratio and the channel and liquid jet Reynolds numbers). In addition, the effect of the process parameters on the shape and the streamwise area of the spray plume and spray penetration height is studied. In particular, the effect of liquid jet and crossflow air velocity on the penetration height and spray area is studied in detail. It is noted that, at a given pressure, temperature, and crossflow air velocity, there is an optimum liquid jet velocity that corresponds to a maximum spray area and an optimum atomization process.",52,7
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052558,"Model updating techniques are used to update dynamic finite element models of structures in light of experimental dynamic test data. While these techniques have been extensively developed and widely applied to structural dynamic finite element models, there is a need to develop and extend these techniques to vibroacoustic systems that involve an elastic structure enclosing a medium, like air. Examples of such systems are commonly found in aerospace, automotive, and some other applications. This paper develops a direct matrix updating formulation for vibroacoustic finite element models so as to allow the updating of the mass and stiffness matrix of both the structural as well the acoustic parts of the model by preserving their symmetry. A numerical example of a rectangular-box cavity backed by a flexible plate is presented to validate the updating method.",52,7
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052559,"Limit cycle oscillation for an airfoil in transonic air flow considering aerodynamic nonlinearity is studied. Transonic nonlinear aerodynamic forces are calculated by solving Euler equations or Navier–Stokes equations with respect to harmonic airfoil plunging/pitching motion, and then the aerodynamic describing functions and the superposition principle are used to build an equivalent linearized aerodynamic model in the frequency domain; hence, the transonic limit cycle oscillation solutions can be obtained by the frequency domain flutter analysis method. The procedures for building the aerodynamic describing function and obtaining the limit cycle oscillation solution are described in detail. Four examples are adopted to verify the accuracy of the present method. The Isogai wing model with NACA 64A010 airfoil is used as the first example to verify the accuracy of the transonic linear flutter solution of the present method. Another NACA 64A010 airfoil model with different structural parameters is then adopted to study its transonic limit cycle oscillation characteristics considering only aerodynamic nonlinearity, and the NACA 0012 airfoil model with both aerodynamic and structural nonlinearities is investigated for its transonic limit cycle oscillation properties. The NLR 7301 airfoil is studied for its limit cycle oscillation characteristics in inviscid and viscous transonic flows, respectively. The results obtained by the present method are in good agreement with those obtained by the existing research with the harmonic balance method and time-marching method. The limitations of the present method are also discussed.",52,7
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052567,"A new shock-fitting technique for unstructured two- and three-dimensional meshes has been recently proposed and developed by the authors. In the present paper, both global and local a posteriori grid-convergence analysis is used to quantitatively measure the discretization error and order of convergence of the numerical solutions obtained using this new unstructured shock-fitting technique. Specifically, the analysis has considered the numerical solutions of two different flows characterized by the presence of strong shocks: a transonic source flow and an hypersonic flow past a circular cylinder. It is shown that the shock-fitting technique allows to compute numerical solutions that converge, both pointwise and in a global sense, with an observed order of accuracy that is very close to the design order of the spatial discretization scheme and with very small discretization errors.",52,7
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052595,"The reactive flow through a model scramjet combustor is simulated using a hybrid large-eddy/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes technique. The scramjet configuration considered is similar to the one investigated at the Institute for Chemical Propulsion of the DLR, German Aerospace Center. The model scramjet consists of 15 fuel-injecting holes, located on the base of a wedge-shaped fuel injector, through which hydrogen is injected at sonic conditions. In the present study, only five of the 15 fuel-injecting holes are considered, and periodicity is assumed in the spanwise direction. Several parametric studies are conducted with a view toward determining the sensitivities of the predictions to modeling and algorithmic variations. Different grids (two different topologies), flux reconstruction methods (total variation diminishing and piecewise parabolic method), reaction mechanisms, and inflow boundary conditions (uniform and nonuniform) are used. To enhance fuel–air mixing, a synthetic eddy method is used to generate turbulence in the injector boundary layers and the hydrogen jets. Finally, a partially stirred reactor-type subgrid combustion model is used as a subgrid closure for the species production rates. The results show that, in all the cases, a lifted flame is predicted with varying standoff distances, heat releases, and shapes.",52,7
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052563,"The flowfield around an axisymmetric forebody at a high angle of attack produces a significant side force. This side force results from an asymmetric pressure distribution around the body due to an asymmetric vortex configuration. Numerical studies of open-loop control using mass blowing slots near the tip of the model have shown a proportional response of the side force over a range of momentum coefficient amplitudes. From the open-loop simulations, a prediction-error minimization method was employed to formulate a linear time-invariant model, which captured the dynamics of the side force response to different mass flow rates applied to either the port or starboard actuator. Based on the linear time-invariant model, a proportional–integral control law was developed for set-point tracking a prescribed side force. The development of the linear time-invariant model, and corresponding linear time-invariant feedback solution are presented to illustrate the model’s capabilities and limitations. The ability to track a set-point signal based on the linear time-invariant model and corresponding proportional–integral control law are shown. The results indicate that the bandwidth of the controller is limited to frequencies below the convective frequency due to the convective time delay. Finally, the linear time-invariant feedback solutions are compared to Navier–Stokes feedback simulations, which show very good agreement.",52,7
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052604,"The cost and time relative to model building could be reduced considerably by the introduction of additive manufacturing. To evaluate the feasibility of the technique to build practical models, a real fighter was adopted as the prototype and a resin–metal hybrid model fully deployed with control surfaces was designed, validated, and tested in the paper. Connection structures that can ensure reliable connections and enable angle adjustment of control surfaces were designed in detail. Based on a careful worst-case analysis from computational fluid dynamics calculations, finite element analysis analyses for strength and stiffness validations were conducted, which shows the safety of the model in testing. First eigenfrequencies of the hybrid model and the metal model were calculated with the FEA method, and the comparison indicates resonance clearance improvement of the hybrid model duo to a remarkable weight reduction by nearly 50% to the metal one. Most aerodynamic coefficients of the hybrid model obtained from wind-tunnel testing are consistent with those of the metal model, from which it can be concluded that the hybrid model can replace metal models in the aerodynamic study for aircraft in the subsonic domain. The efficiency to build models was also improved significantly.",52,7
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052608,"A fundamental research study of the supersaturation region is presented. This region is mapped in the NASA Langley 31-Inch Mach 10 Air Wind Tunnel freestream flow using physical probes (total temperature and pitot) and a nonintrusive offbody diagnostic (laser Rayleigh scattering). Data from all three methods are acquired simultaneously. Facility stagnation pressures spanned 1.0–10.0 MPa (150–1450 psi), and stagnation temperatures spanned 357–1000 K (184–1350°F). Each instrument has its own unique supersaturation region over which quantitative measurements can be obtained. The extent of each supersaturation region is a unique function of the sensitivity of the instrument selected to flowfield clustering. Laser-Rayleigh-scattering-measured density results agree to better than 15% with the freestream density computed using the GASPROPS code over a significant fraction of the supersaturation region. Evidence is presented showing that the “frozen” vibrational nonequilibrium Boltzmann population of and molecules inhibit clustering and condensation. This is the physical mechanism responsible for creating the supersaturation region. In direct conflict with the assumption in all hypersonic literature from the past 50 years, evidence is presented indicating that no hypersonic or hypervelocity freestream in which nucleation is occurring contains a frozen vibrational nonequilibrium population. This population is effectively eliminated by interacting with clusters.",52,7
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052631,"A simplified four-unknown shear and normal deformation plate theory is proposed. It is used to study the response of multilayered angle-ply composite plates due to a variation in temperature and moisture concentrations. The effects of temperature and moisture concentrations on the material properties and the hygrothermal response of multilayered angle-ply composite plates are studied. A number of examples are solved to illustrate the numerical results concerning bending response of multilayered angle-ply composite plates subjected to hygrothermal effects. It is suggested that temperature-dependent and/or moisture-dependent material properties ought to be used in the analysis of laminated plates subjected to hygrothermal loads. Additional comparisons between the present theory and the classical, uniform, and parabolic shear deformation plate theories are made to show how the effect of transverse normal strain is highly significant.",52,7
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052588,"Analysis of the acoustic signature produced by truncated ideal contour and thrust-optimized parabolic nozzles is conducted during both fixed and transient (startup) operations. The truncated ideal contour nozzle experiences free-shock separation flow, whereas the thrust-optimized parabolic nozzle experiences both free-shock separation and restricted-shock separation flow states during startup. This study provides a direct comparison of the acoustic signature produced during free-shock separation and restricted-shock separation flow states while operating under identical nozzle pressure ratios. During a transient episode, the continuous wavelet transform is used to compare the acoustic signatures produced by the nozzles. The truncated ideal contour nozzle demonstrates a gradual increase in broadband frequency energy with increasing nozzle pressure ratio and with broadband shock noise appearing at higher nozzle pressure ratios. The thrust-optimized parabolic nozzle, however, displays a much larger sensitivity to the nozzle pressure ratio. In particular, the free-shock separation to restricted-shock separation transition, which occurs around nozzle pressure ratio 24.4, is weakly revealed in the acoustic signature along sideline angles to the nozzle. At nozzle pressure ratio 13, the acoustic signal observed at shallow angles to the nozzle decreases abruptly across a broad range of frequencies. The latter phenomenon is attributed to the formation of an open-ended subsonic core surrounded by a supersonic annular flow in the thrust-optimized parabolic nozzle during free-shock separation operations of the nozzle, which does not occur in the truncated ideal contour nozzle.",52,7
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052745,"A large-eddy simulation/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model is applied to three high-speed mixing layers and three sonic injection flows to generate data suitable for evaluating two current Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models for turbulent mass diffusivity. These models solve transport equations for concentration variance and dissipation rate and differ in the constitutive relation for the turbulent mass diffusivity and the form of the evolution equation for the dissipation rate. The predictive capability of the large-eddy simulation/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model is assessed through simulations of an air–air mixing-layer experiment and a sonic ethylene injection into a Mach 2.0 airstream. This model provides good predictions of the mean velocity, turbulence intensity, and rms temperature fluctuation throughout the shear layer flowfield but slightly over-predicts the spreading rate of the mixing layer. The simulation of the sonic injection is in generally good agreement with the experiment but underpredicts the level of jet entrainment. Four other large-eddy simulation/Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes data sets, involving the replacement of the lower airstream in the mixing-layer configuration by an argon stream and a helium stream, and a replacement of the injectant gas in the sonic injection experiment with argon and helium are also generated. All data sets are “mined” to extract turbulent mass diffusivities, concentration variances, and scalar dissipation rates associated with the resolved eddy motion. The results show that both models can be optimized to achieve a good match with the exact scalar variance production rate.",52,7
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052585,"The current paper evaluates the control authority of electric arc plasma actuators on a supersonic axisymmetric base flow for several actuator geometries, frequencies, forcing modes, duty cycles/on-times, and currents. The disturbances were tracked in time with phase-locked schlieren imaging and particle image velocimetry. The actuators caused moderate influences on the axisymmetric shear-layer velocity profile and base pressure. The most substantial changes to the shear layer and base pressure were noted for the highest current and duty cycle experiments. At 1 A and 20% duty cycle, the base pressure was reduced by 3.5%. Similar changes were noted for all modes and a range of Strouhal numbers from about 1.11 to 3.33 (10–30 kHz). Increases in duty cycle between 4 and 20% caused a nearly linear decrease in base pressure. Disturbances were tracked at all frequencies and translated along the shear layer at a convective velocity of . A fairly clear trend of increasing velocity disturbance amplitude correlating to increasing base pressure changes was noted. Moreover, the ability of the disturbances to stay well organized farther down the shear layer also appears to be a significant factor in the actuators’ effect on base pressure. Consistent with these observations, it appears that increased duty cycle causes increased shear-layer disturbance amplitudes.",52,7
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052649,"The flow past a microramp immersed in a supersonic turbulent boundary layer is studied by means of numerical simulations with the implicit large-eddy simulation technique and experiments conducted with tomographic particle image velocimetry. The experimental data are mostly used to verify the validity of the numerical results by ample comparisons on the time-averaged velocity, turbulent statistics, and vortex intensity. Although some discrepancies are observed on the intensity of the upwash motion generated by the streamwise vortex pair, the rates of the recovery of momentum deficit and the decay of streamwise vortex pair intensity are found in good agreement. The instantaneous flow organization is inspected, making use of the flow realizations available from implicit large-eddy simulation. The flow behind the microramp exhibits significant large-scale unsteady fluctuations. Notably, the quasi-conical shear layer enclosing the wake is strongly undulated under the action of Kelvin–Helmholtz (K–H) vortices. The resulted vortices induce localized high-speed arches in the outer region and a deceleration within the wake associated with ejection of low-momentum fluid. Because of the presence of the K–H vortex, the streamwise vortex filaments exhibit downward and outward motions. The further evolution of vortical structures within the wake features the development of K–H vortices from arch shape to full ring in the far wake, under the effects of the streamwise vortices, which induce an inward motion of the vortex legs and eventually connect the vortex at the bottom.",52,7
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052607,"The strand/Cartesian-grid approach provides many advantages for complex moving-body-flow simulations, including fully automatic volume grid generation, highly scalable domain connectivity, and high-order accuracy. In this work, the authors evaluate methods of handling sharp corners with strand grids through combinations of strand vector smoothing, multiple strands emanating from a single surface node, and telescoping Cartesian refinement into corner regions of the near-body grid. A new discretization strategy is introduced to better tolerate mesh skewness induced by strand smoothing. These approaches are tested for unsteady, laminar, and high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows. For standard viscous high-aspect-ratio grids, smoothed strands with telescoping Cartesian refinement provide the most accurate results with the least complexity. Mesh discontinuities associated with the use of multiple strands at sharp corners produce more error than with smoothed strands. With both strand approaches—vector smoothing and multiple strands—targeted Cartesian refinement is critical to capture features near sharp corners that strand grids alone are too coarse to capture.",52,7
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052668,"Localized arc filament plasma actuators were used to control pressure fluctuations in a cavity with a depth of 12.7 mm and length-to-depth ratio of 4.86. The rear wall of the cavity is inclined 30 deg with respect to the upstream flow, and the cavity length is 61.7 mm. Five actuators were uniformly distributed along the span of the cavity, 1 mm upstream of the cavity leading edge. Experiments were conducted in a flow with a Mach number of 0.6 and a Reynolds number based on the cavity depth of . Forcing was conducted quasi-two-dimensionally (all actuators operated in phase) and three-dimensionally (actuators operated out of phase). The objective of the research was twofold: first, to demonstrate that the peak tone as well as the broadband pressure fluctuations can be suppressed in a strongly resonating cavity, and second, the resonance can be re-established and the peak tone as well as the broadband pressure fluctuations can be amplified in a weakly resonating cavity. Time-resolved pressure and particle-image-velocimetry measurements were used to assess the effectiveness of the actuators and to explore the physics of the flow. Although both quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional controls were successful in controlling the flow, the control was less sensitive to forcing frequency change in the latter in achieving the first objective. The results also showed that, although there are many forcing frequency options in achieving the first objective, the options are limited to frequencies near the dominant (even though weak) Rossiter modes in re-establishing the feedback in a weakly resonating cavity.",52,7
