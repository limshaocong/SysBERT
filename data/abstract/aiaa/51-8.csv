0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052248,"The Navier–Stokes equations were solved using a high-fidelity time-implicit numerical scheme and an implicit large-eddy simulation approach to investigate plasma-based flow control for supersonic flow over a compression ramp. The configuration included a flat-plate region to develop an equilibrium turbulent boundary layer at Mach 2.25, which was validated against a set of experimental measurements. The fully turbulent boundary-layer flow traveled over a 24 deg ramp and produced an unsteady shock-induced separation. A control strategy to suppress the separation through a magnetically-driven surface-discharge actuator was explored. The size, strength, and placement of the model actuator were based on recent experiments at the Princeton University Applied Physics Group. Three control scenarios were examined: steady control, pulsing with a 50% duty cycle, and a case with significant Joule heating. The control mechanism was very effective at reducing the time-mean separation length for all three cases. The steady control case was the most effective, with a reduction in the separation length of more than 75%. The controller was also found to significantly reduce the low-frequency content of the turbulent kinetic energy spectra within the separated region and reduce the total turbulent kinetic energy downstream of reattachment.",51,8
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051861,"A method to obtain a spatially developing equilibrium supersonic turbulent flat-plate boundary layer suitable for direct numerical simulations or large-eddy simulations of viscous/inviscid interactions is described. A steady counterflow actuator with properties based on a dielectric barrier discharge is employed to trip an incoming laminar boundary layer. The resulting unstable shear layer transitions rapidly and breaks down to generate the desired turbulent boundary layer. A fifth-order bandwidth and order optimized weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme using Roe fluxes is used along with sixth-order viscous terms to simulate this process. The properties of the boundary layer are exhaustively analyzed on meshes of 65, 37, and 20 million grid points. The fine-grid solution agrees with the mean flow and statistical properties observed in the literature, and is used as a truth model to investigate results on smaller meshes. The medium-grid solution reproduces the fine-grid behavior with modest differences in some quantities. The coarse-grid solution shows delayed transition and reproduces some flow quantities with significant discrepancies in others. Anticipated coherent structures are observed to exist on all grids. An examination of the length scale and timescale of the turbulence shows no signature of the tripping mechanism.",51,8
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052260,"This work seeks to provide a closed-form analytical solution for the transverse vortical wave generated at the sidewall of a circular cylinder with headwall injection. This particular configuration mimics the conditions leading to the onset of traveling radial and tangential waves in an idealized liquid rocket engine chamber. Assuming a short cylindrical enclosure with axisymmetric injection, regular perturbations are used to linearize the problem’s conservation equations. Flow decomposition is subsequently applied to the first-order disturbance equations, thus giving rise to a compressible, inviscid, acoustic set responsible for driving the unsteady motion and to an incompressible, viscous, vortical set driven by virtue of coupling with the acoustic mode along both the sidewall and headwall. While the acoustic mode is readily recovered from the wave equation, the induced vortical mode is resolved using boundary-layer theory and an expansion of the rotational equations with respect to a small viscous parameter, . At the outset, an explicit formulation for the leading-order vortical field is derived and verified numerically. A radial penetration number akin to the Stokes or Womersley numbers is identified and found to control the penetration depth of the viscous boundary layer forming above the inert sidewall. This parameter is based on the transverse oscillation mode frequency and scales with the squared ratio of the Stokes layer and the chamber’s characteristic radius.",51,8
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051811,"The dynamics of transitional and turbulent boundary layers is explored via a hybrid vortex filament/finite volume simulation scheme in which vortical structures are identified without the constraints imposed by the traditional assumption that they are synonymous with rotational regions. Vortex furrows consisting of elongated, streamwise-oriented, raised perturbations to the wall vorticity layer overlying low-speed streaks are found to be the principal structural element appearing during the Klebanoff-type transition. A number of dynamical properties of the furrows are considered, providing new insights into such questions as why hairpinlike rotational regions form that occur both singly and in pairs, why and how low-speed streaks form and why they persist, and why mushroomlike shapes and “pockets” are found in smoke visualizations of boundary layers. The physical picture of the boundary layer that emerges from the consideration of the dynamics of the vortex furrows provides some insights into why turbulence in the boundary layer is self-sustaining.",51,8
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051860,"Within the scope of a flight research project involving dynamically scaled models, active flow control was investigated for a modified NACA airfoil. At low-Reynolds-number conditions, the aerodynamic performance of the modified NACA airfoil is considerably reduced by flow separation. Computational-fluid-dynamics simulations of the natural (uncontrolled) and controlled flow were carried out and provide the basis for a detailed analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms. The simulation results for the natural uncontrolled flow compare well with wind-tunnel measurements. Simulations and experiments show a large trailing-edge separation at low angles of attack and a leading-edge separation bubble at high angles of attack. To control the laminar separation and improve the overall performance of the airfoil at the low-Reynolds-number conditions, time-periodic blowing and suction through a spanwise slot is employed. A strong dependence of the effectiveness of the active flow control on the forcing parameters, such as forcing frequency and forcing slot location, is found. In addition, linear stability analysis is employed to identify the instability mechanisms that are responsible for the effectiveness of the flow-control approach.",51,8
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052399,"In the present study, new nonpolynomial shear-deformation theories are proposed and implemented for structural responses of laminated-composite and sandwich plates. The theories assume nonlinear distribution of transverse shear stresses, and also satisfy the traction-free boundary conditions at the top and bottom layers of the laminates. The governing differential equations are derived for a generalized shear-deformation theory by implementing the dynamic version of principle of virtual work and calculus of variations. A generalized closed-form solution methodology of the Navier type is implemented to ensure the validity and efficiency of the present theories for bending, buckling, and free-vibration responses of the laminated-composite and sandwich plates. It is observed that the proposed formulation in conjunction with the solution methodology is capable of handling all existing five-degree-of-freedom-based shear-deformation theories. The comparison of results also shows that the adequate choice of shear deformation leads to an accurate prediction of structural responses. The influence of shear deformation on the type of analysis performed is also observed in this study. The theories are also capable of an efficient prediction of the responses of structures at a similar computational cost as that of other equivalent single-layer theories.",51,8
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052289,"Reynolds-averaged turbulence models can result in large numerical error at flow discontinuities like shock waves. This is due to the nonconservative nature of the source terms in the governing equations. In this paper, the turbulence model is used to compute the canonical interaction of a normal shock with homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The characteristics of the nonconservative error is studied as a function of shock strength, grid resolution, and upstream turbulence level. The model equations are cast in an equivalent conservation form that gives physically consistent results at a shock wave. The predicted amplifications of turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate match direct numerical simulation data and linear theory estimates over a range of Mach numbers.",51,8
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052080,"Synthetic jet actuators are investigated for rapidly maneuvering airfoils that are regulated by a closed-loop control system. To support active flow-control simulations performed here, the closed-loop system and vehicle dynamics are coupled with computational fluid dynamics. High-frequency sinusoidal pitching simulations with and without synthetic jet actuation indicate that the current synthetic jet actuators provide bidirectional change in aerodynamic forces during rapid maneuvers whose time scales are of the same order as the flow time scales. Responses of a wind-tunnel airfoil are well represented in the current simulations, which allows us to predict the response of the system for dynamic conditions representative of free flight. The control system is able to execute rapid free-flight maneuvers. It is observed that the controller is responding to small fluctuations caused by vortex shedding from the trailing-edge actuators.",51,8
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052239,"The combination of structural material and fluid pressure may result in a morphing structure with integrated shape-change and stiffness functions. In a cellular arrangement, distributed actuation, high control fidelity and a multitude of morphing shapes can also be achieved. The moving isosurface threshold topology optimization method was used to design the cell shapes, and the optimality of the method is shown via use of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. This optimization method was applied to the case of a morphing NACA 0012 trailing edge. The optimal shapes were found to be structures featuring arches that enclose the pressurized fluid and elongate along the cell edges, resulting in overall bending or elongation for various architecture networks. An experimental model based on the optimization results was fabricated for demonstrative purposes and deflection was achieved for this 15 cell parallel-type morphing trailing-edge prototype.",51,8
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052269,"This paper presents an experimental and numerical study of the folding, stowage, and deployment behavior of viscoelastic tape springs. Experiments show that during folding the relationship between load and displacement is nonlinear and varies with rate and temperature. In particular, the limit and propagation loads increase with the folding rate but decrease with temperature. During stowage, relaxation behavior leads to a reduction in internal forces that significantly impacts the subsequent deployment dynamics. The deployment behavior starts with a short, dynamic transient that is followed by a steady deployment and ends with a slow creep recovery. Unlike elastic tape springs, localized folds in viscoelastic tape springs do not move during deployment. Finite-element simulations based on a linear viscoelastic constitutive model with an experimentally determined relaxation modulus are shown to accurately reproduce the experimentally observed behavior, and to capture the effects of geometric nonlinearity, time and temperature dependence.",51,8
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052235,"This paper presents a zonal detached-eddy simulation of a leading-edge stall airfoil in poststall conditions. Different detached-eddy-simulation-type methodologies are first evaluated and discussed and the paper presents in detail the results obtained with the mode 1 of the zonal detached-eddy simulation that is based on a prescribed switch between the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and the large-eddy simulation regions. The results obtained with the selected approach are presented and compared to detailed experimental results including unsteady pressure measurements and unsteady velocity flowfield measurements acquired using time-resolved particle image velocimetry and laser Doppler velocimetry. Important features of the flow are correctly captured by the computation and good agreements are observed with experiments on pressure distribution, separation location and aerodynamic forces. The unsteady properties of the calculation are also compared with unsteady measurements showing that the frequency indicating that the vortex shedding is correctly predicted in the computation. Detailed analysis of the mixing-layer and the wake properties highlights some deficiency of the computations that are fully analyzed. Especially, the grid resolution in the early stages of the mixing layer appears to be of primary importance for the present application. The detailed comparisons of the zonal detached-eddy simulation result with the experimental data allow general requirements to be drawn for further improvements.",51,8
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052232,"The effects of pulsation intensity on the flow and mixing characteristics of acoustically excited swirling double-concentric jets were studied experimentally. The central jet was excited with various pulsation intensities. The flow evolution process, jet spread width, velocity instabilities, and jet dispersion characteristics were examined by the flow visualization, edge-detection technique, hot-wire anemometer, and tracer-gas concentration detection, respectively. As the pulsation intensity was increased over 0.16 one vortex ring was induced during each excitation cycle. This induced vortex ring evolved downstream and suddenly broke up into turbulent eddies at a distance downstream from the jet exit. The dispersion and mixing were simultaneously dominated by two mechanisms: 1) the breakup of the induced vortex ring into turbulent eddies, and 2) the near-field entrainment of the induced vortex rings. The former was more important at pulsation intensities smaller than about 0.5, whereas the latter was more prominent at pulsation intensities larger than approximately 0.5. The results of flow visualization as well as the measurements of velocity, fluctuation intensity, turbulence time and length scales, and tracer-gas-concentration distributions showed close correlations in interpreting the flow and mixing characteristics. Exciting the swirling double-concentric jets at a pulsation intensity of 1.0 might increase the mixing index by 90% over the unexcited jets.",51,8
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052217,"This paper presents a method for defining a barycentric coordinate system on a -objective Pareto frontier that is constructed from nondomination levels calculated over subsets of the objectives taken at a time. Unlike past approaches, these “nondomination-level coordinates” are not limited by the dimensionality, convexity, or curvature of the frontier, and they have an inherent meaning as relative preferences for the competing objectives. This intuitive behavior makes the coordinates particularly useful as the basis for parametric models of the frontier and for conducting sensitivity studies and interactive trade-space exploration. The method is demonstrated on three mathematical example problems exhibiting different geometric properties and on a conceptual wing-sizing problem.",51,8
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052319,"This paper presents an experimental investigation of the control of airfoil aerodynamics at a low Reynolds number of within a wide range of attack angle using a leading-edge-protuberance technique. The essence of the technique is to manipulate flow around the airfoil by replacing the straight leading edge of a baseline airfoil with a sinusoidal wavy airfoil. Whereas the lift and drag forces and the lift-to-drag ratio were measured using a three-component force balance, the flow was mainly measured using a particle-image velocimetry. The sinusoidal protuberances effectively suppressed airfoil stall, and the corresponding aerodynamic performance was impaired to some extent. Meanwhile, control significantly improved the airfoil aerodynamics in the poststall region, for example, , leading to a maximum 25.0 and 39.2% increase in lift coefficient and lift-to-drag ratio, respectively, and a maximum 20.0% decrease in drag coefficient. The protuberances may influence control performance in a similar way with low-profile vortex generators. The flow physics behind the observations were discussed in detail.",51,8
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052268,"A multipoint optimization approach is used to solve aerodynamic design problems encompassing a broad range of operating conditions in the objective function and constraints. The designer must specify the range of on-design operating conditions, the objective function to be minimized, a weighting function based on the mission or fleet requirements, and a set of performance and geometric constraints. Based on this designer input, a weighted-integral objective function is developed. The numerical optimization problem is then formulated as a constrained multipoint problem with the weight assigned to each operating condition determined by a quadrature rule. The approach is illustrated with several design problems for transonic civil transport aircraft and is extended to the formulation of aircraft range and endurance objective functions for use in the design of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The results demonstrate that the approach enables the designer to design an airfoil that is precisely tailored to the problem specification. Pareto fronts are presented as a means of providing the designer with information on tradeoffs that can be used to guide the problem specification.",51,8

Centrifugal forces caused by the spinning of the stage could drive the liquid propellant away from the outlet of a propellant-management device, resulting in malfunction of the system. A simplified model of the propellant-management device is studied, which includes two parallel disks segmented with radially mounted baffles and a central tube. The stability of the menisci between the disks under the influence of the central tube meniscus is examined with Surface Evolver simulations and drop-tower experiments.",51,8
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052247,"The geometrically nonlinear behavior of modern soft-core sandwich plates is studied. For this purpose, a specially tailored geometrically nonlinear finite element that is based on a high-order sandwich plate theory is developed. The theory uses a von Kármán type of geometrical nonlinearity in the face sheets and account for shear and through the thickness deformability of the core. The conversion of the theory to a specially tailored finite element extends its applicability to a wide range of structural layouts, allows the use of standard numerical techniques, and simplifies the coupling with other elements. Yet it avoids the need for meshing through the thickness of the plate. The application of the specially tailored finite element to the geometrically nonlinear analysis of in-plane and out-of-plane loaded sandwich plates explores many interesting physical phenomena. Among them, the evolution of localized instabilities during a globally stable load-deflection behavior, the development of localized diagonal wrinkling patterns, and their impact on the interfacial stresses are listed. The development of unique load resisting mechanisms and, particularly, the evolution of these mechanisms along the geometrically nonlinear response path are also detected. The paper discusses these effects and their role in the geometrically nonlinear behavior of the soft-core sandwich plate.",51,8
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052415,"Density and density-gradient values were quantified for subcritical to supercritical jets, and a novel method was applied for calculating the core lengths using the structures detected across the entire jet center plane. Jet spreading angles were also calculated, and a model was proposed for the spreading angle dependence on the chamber-to-injectant density ratio. A detailed comparison was provided with existing theoretical models and experimental data for both core lengths and spreading angles. Single and binary species mixtures were used to study the injection and mixing characteristics of both subcritical and supercritical jets.",51,8
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051655,"Monte Carlo techniques are used to estimate the integrals of a function using randomly generated samples. The interest in uncertainty quantification and robust design makes calculating the expected values of such functions (e.g., performance measures) important. Recent developments in scramjets, aircraft technology forecasting, structural reliability, and robust low-boom aircraft designs use Monte Carlo techniques to ensure the appropriate quantification of uncertainties. Because of high variance and slow convergence, Monte Carlo techniques require a large number of function evaluations, limiting the fidelity of the tools that can be used to predict performance. Stacked Monte Carlo is presented, which is a new method for postprocessing an existing set of Monte Carlo samples to improve integral estimation. Stacked Monte Carlo is based on combining fitting functions with cross-validation and should reduce the variance of any type of Monte Carlo integral estimate (importance sampling, quasi-Monte Carlo, etc.) without adding bias. An extensive set of experiments is reported, confirming that the stacked Monte Carlo estimate is more accurate than both the unprocessed Monte Carlo estimate and the estimate from a functional fit. Stacked Monte Carlo is applied to estimate the fuel-burn metrics of future commercial aircraft and sonic boom loudness measures, and the efficiency of Monte Carlo is compared with that of more standard methods. It is shown that for negligible, additional, computational cost, significant increases in accuracy are gained.",51,8
