The near-wall microscopic fluid problem is addressed by solving for the Stokes flow with a boundary element method, yielding slip lengths for all the surface shapes considered. Such lengths are then used in Navier boundary conditions of the macroscopic, turbulent problem, which is solved by direct numerical simulations. The results of the direct simulations demonstrate that inward-contracting riblets enjoy an additional drag reduction when compared to the base, triangular configuration, whereas outward-protruding riblets experience a skin-friction increase. The results are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model.",56,6
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056565,"This paper presents an experimental investigation of the oscillations of the leading-edge vortex breakdown locations over a slender delta wing with a 75 deg sweep angle. Here, a new mechanism is proposed, the vortex–secondary-flow interaction, responsible for the quasi-periodic antisymmetric interaction of the leading-edge vortex breakdown locations; the induced secondary flow in the symmetric plane continuously transfers the disturbance induced by the leading-edge vortex breakdown from one semispan to another, as well as the corresponding positive feedback. Therefore, the oscillations of the leading-edge vortex breakdown locations are synchronized in an opposite phase by the induced secondary flow. The experimental results are consistent with this interaction mechanism. Moreover, a new small-scale oscillation of the leading-edge vortex breakdown location is observed upon the application of an improved peak-valley-counting method. Its frequency is in the range of the helical mode instability.",56,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056877,"Transient energy growth suppression is a common control objective for feedback flow control aimed at delaying transition to turbulence. A prevailing control approach in this context is observer-based feedback, in which a full-state feedback controller is applied to state estimates from an observer. The present study identifies a fundamental performance limitation of observer-based feedback control: whenever the uncontrolled system exhibits transient energy growth in response to optimal disturbances, control by observer-based feedback will necessarily lead to transient energy growth in response to optimal disturbances for the closed-loop system as well. Indeed, this result establishes that observer-based feedback can be a poor candidate for controller synthesis in the context of transient energy growth suppression and transition delay; the performance objective of transient energy growth suppression can never be achieved by means of observer-based feedback. Further, an illustrative example is used to show that alternative forms of output feedback are not necessarily subject to these same performance limitations and should also be considered in the context of transient energy growth suppression and transition control.",56,6

A hypersonic inlet model using the new control method is designed and investigated by both experimental and numerical methods. The results show that the prediction method can yield acceptable prediction accuracy. The inlet using the new fluidic shock control method can maintain the shock-on-lip condition at both Mach 4.92 and 5.74. Compared with the existing fluidic shock control methods, the total pressure recovery of the inlet using the new fluidic shock control method is further increased by 3.46% while the mass flow rate of secondary flow used to control the ramps shock is reduced by 28.82%. Therefore, the new fluidic shock control method not only eliminates the complex coupling of the valve opening with the isolator pressure distribution, but also obtains a better inlet performance with less secondary mass flow rate.",56,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057043,"Because of the rising cost and scarcity of helium, new methods to ensure buoyancy for lighter-than-air vehicles are being sought. One alternative under study uses an internal vacuum to reduce the weight-to-buoyancy ratio. It is a novel approach, but the vacuum presents challenges for the vehicle’s structure. The structure must have minimum mass while preventing buckling and excess stress throughout the frame and membrane. The structure under analysis is a hexakis icosahedron with a membrane covering. Achieving minimum mass involves optimizing the structure under loading conditions. Finite element analysis and direct-search methods are employed, providing an optimal design under various regimes. Specifically, ABAQUS is used as the finite element analysis modeler, and mesh-adaptive direct search is the optimization scheme. Overall size is a concern, and so one objective is to reduce the diameter of the vehicle as much as possible, using materials available at this time. To date, the smallest design analyzed had a diameter of 20 ft (6.096 m). This research demonstrates the feasibility of two designs, one at 15 ft (4.572 m) and another at 4 ft (1.2192 m). The problem formulation includes multiple black-box objectives and constraints. Results for various designs investigated are presented and compared.",56,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056794,"A local wall shear-stress vector measurement technique has been developed using a thin circular plate, referred to as a sublayer plate, which is attached to the wall in the sublayer of a near-wall turbulent flow. The pressure difference between the leading and trailing edges of the plate is correlated to the known wall shear stress obtained in the fully developed turbulent channel flow. A circular sublayer plate surrounded by eight pressure taps is designed to measure the wall shear-stress vector. The curvature of the round edge of the circular plate slightly reduces the sensitivity to the wall shear-stress magnitude in comparison with a rectangular plate. The circular plate can successfully detect the flow direction over a wide-range flow angle. The circular plate with eight pressure taps has a higher resolution in the measurement of the wall shear vector for a small angle of attack using the ratio of the pressure differences at two taps adjacent to the tap showing the maximum stagnation pressure.",56,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056304,"Polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paints with reduced surface roughness were developed for measuring unsteady pressure fields in transonic flow. Four types of polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paints, each having different properties (such as particle size, mass content, and solvent), were formulated and applied to transonic wind-tunnel tests of a supercritical airfoil. The effects of surface roughness on the unsteady transonic flow on the airfoil were evaluated at Mach 0.74 at a Reynolds number of . It was found that all four polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paints could be used to measure time-series pressure distributions, but the location of the shock wave and the root-mean-square pressure fluctuations differed, depending on the type of polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paint. Among the tested polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paints, having an arithmetic surface roughness of and a cutoff frequency of 3 kHz yielded practically the same data as a clean airfoil. Using this polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paint, propagation of pressure waves and oscillation of shock waves on the airfoil were clearly captured. A spectral analysis revealed that the fundamental frequency of shock-wave oscillation agreed very well with that calculated based on the mechanism proposed in previous studies. These results showed that the selected polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paint is an effective means by which to study transonic buffeting on airfoils and three-dimensional wings.",56,6

A broad range of gap depths and widths is modeled that can be sufficient to generate localized pockets of reverse flow. Boundary-layer profiles are computed using a Navier–Stokes solver, permitting a thorough investigation of all configurations considered. The linear stability of Tollmien–Schlichting waves is then examined using parabolized stability equations and linearized Navier–Stokes formulations, with the former method giving excellent agreement with the latter for all disturbances studied, including within separated boundary layers. Tollmien–Schlichting disturbances are amplified by deeper and wider gaps, with a correlation derived by relating the increase in the factor with the gap dimensions and freestream Reynolds number.",56,6

A local spatial linear stability theory analysis with Newtonian eddy model of a profile extracted from the strongly curved section did not indicate any spatially growing steady modes. An unstable steady mode could be identified when the quasi-laminar assumption was made. The mode shape roughly agreed with the observed steady flow structures. Further analysis revealed that this mode was most strongly amplified when the frequency was nonzero. Based on a comparison of the Reynolds stress profiles upstream and inside the cascade, it is argued that the unstable mode may affect the mean flow through a modification of the Reynolds shear stresses.",56,6

Recent methods used to model the response of flight and road vehicles to unsteady flow disturbances, as well as modeling approaches for the dynamic effects of active flow control, are presented in the framework of a feedforward/feedback control architecture. Limitations of the achievable control performance are discussed. For instance, the lift reversal and the delay time required for the lift increment to reach its maximum value are responsible for limiting the bandwidth that can be achieved with active flow control of separated flows. An estimate of the practical gust bandwidth that can be controlled with aircraft is made.",56,6

Simple phenomenological models that connect the jet deflection to the feedback flow are developed. Several geometric variations are considered to explore the characteristic scales and phase relationships associated with the jet oscillation and to assess the proposed phenomenological model. Examination of the internal fluid dynamics of the oscillator indicates that the sweeping jet mechanism is related to the evolution of the separation bubble in the mixing chamber. A detailed analysis suggests that the distance from the initial jet attachment point to the outlet junction is the most appropriate length scale associated with the oscillation frequency, and the results show that the jet oscillation frequency is inversely proportional to this length scale.",56,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056111,"The goal of the present study is to investigate the flow separation control process over a NACA 0015 airfoil model in a wind tunnel under the actuation of the nanosecond dielectric-barrier discharge plasma actuators at Reynolds numbers of 268,000 and 463,000. Detailed force measurements were carried out together with flowfield measurements employing time-resolved particle image velocimetry techniques. Both the force and particle image velocimetry measurements indicated that the nanosecond dielectric-barrier discharge functions as a trip device at the narrow range of angle of attack just around the stall angle, where a bistable mode exists for the original airfoil, which exhibits a leading-edge stall behavior. The particle image velocimetry measurements have shown that the few initial plasma discharges have much stronger effects on the separated flow compared to the subsequent plasma pulses, which is possibly due to the fact that the separated shear layer is altered and the separation location has shifted downstream, hence leading to the most receptive location moving away from the plasma actuation location. The separated flow undergoes a short period of transient flow state before reaching a quasi-periodic flow state. The transient flow state clearly exhibits a stronger tendency of flow attachment to the airfoil surface with less fluctuation compared to the subsequent quasi-periodic flow state. With the increase of the actuation frequency, the flow separation is further suppressed and delayed farther downstream under the conditions studied here.",56,6

A theoretical thrust model is proposed to establish that the thrust increases to a maximum and then drops steadily as the pressure monotonically increases over a pressure range from 10 to 90 kPa. A formula for revealing the relationships among the pressure, permittivity, dielectric thickness, and operating voltage is derived from the model. This formula shows that a higher operating voltage and smaller ratio of dielectric thickness to permittivity can lead to a higher pressure at the point of maximum thrust. The theoretical results are consistent with the experimental results. The results can be used to determine the optimal operating pressure for a single dielectric barrier discharge thruster.",56,6
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056704,"This Paper presents a nonlinear frequency-domain solver for the vortex lattice method. Assuming a periodic solution, the wing circulation is represented in time by a Fourier series without the assumption of small-amplitude oscillations and with a prescribed wake. The linear system of the vortex lattice method is developed in the frequency domain, allowing the periodic solution to be formulated as a steady problem. Two different approaches are proposed to solve the nonlinear system of equations, an iterative segregated approach and a direct frequency-domain approach. The method is verified against two-dimensional Theordorsen theory as well as three-dimensional solutions from the doublet lattice method and the time-domain unsteady vortex lattice method. The spectral accuracy of the method is demonstrated as is its capabilities of capturing nonlinear effects from wake intersections. The resulting time-spectral vortex lattice method solver is computationally efficient with precision comparable to the time-domain unsteady vortex lattice method solver, thus making the approach interesting for aerospace applications.",56,6
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056285,"The Paper presents a new methodology for the numerical estimation of the Green’s functions in complex external aeroacoustic configurations. Computational aeroacoustics is used to propagate multifrequency signals from focus points to microphones. The method takes advantage of the sparsity of the Green’s functions in the time domain to minimize the simulation time. It leads to a complex sparse linear regression problem. To solve it, the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is adapted. The method is first applied on the case of the diffraction by a rigid sphere. Results are studied both in terms of Green’s function estimation and aeroacoustic beamforming. They show that the Green’s functions are obtained with a good accuracy and enable localization of acoustic sources placed behind the diffracting object. The methodology is then applied on a NACA0012 two-dimensional wing in a potential flow for which the Green’s function is not known analytically. The use of the reverse-flow reciprocity principle enables reduction of the complexity of the estimation problem when there are more scan points than microphones. It is shown that it is possible to take advantage of the presence of diffracting objects to improve the capability of detection of a sensor array.",56,6

UTCart consists of an automatic Cartesian grid generator based on an octree structure and a compressible flow solver that uses an immersed boundary method with a turbulent wall function for the wall boundary condition. Using the UTCart grid generator, the medium grid (approximately 50 million cells) around the NASA Common Research Model is generated in 43 min. For the prediction of the drag coefficient at the cruise condition, the difference between the medium-grid result and the grid-converged value is 24 drag counts (8%). For the fine-grid (approximately 97 million cells) result, the difference reduces to 15 drag counts (5%). Although the drag coefficient is slightly overestimated, the componentwise aerodynamic coefficient shows a consistent trend of grid convergence. Furthermore, the qualitative flow features, including flow separation at high angles of attack, agree well with the experimental data and the computational results on conventional body-fitted grids.",56,6

Such a tool will be of significant value for evaluating low-cost analytical methods needed for tradeoff studies and fine tuning of low-order computational models for engine performance and noise prediction. For turbulence representation, the system offers two approaches: the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, and a zonal approach that treats the part of the flowfield upstream of the fan by unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and the remaining part (the interstage, outlet guide vane, and exhaust regions) by improved delayed detached-eddy simulation combined with a volume synthetic turbulence generator for triggering the scale-resolving capability of the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation. Details of the proposed methodology are outlined, including problem statements for simplified (“duct-only”) and full (including the entire nacelle and external flow) configurations. The results are presented, demonstrating the capabilities of the methodology and its validation by means of comparison of the mean and unsteady flow characteristics with experimental data for the NASA source diagnostic test.

18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056567,"Flat plate experiments investigating flow development downstream of normal shock wave–laminar boundary-layer interactions are reported. Laminarity is desirable for low drag, but problems are expected at shock interactions due to separation, leading to unsteadiness and large boundary-layer growth. A flat plate with elliptical leading edge profile is used to generate a laminar boundary layer, which encounters a Mach 1.2 normal shock at a Reynolds number of . Upstream of the interaction, the boundary layer is too thin for detailed measurement, but schlieren images are presented and laser Doppler velocimetry results reported downstream. For comparison, similar measurements are then made with trips located upstream. Far downstream, shape factor and skin friction are seen to be independent of incoming boundary-layer state, contrary to expectations: although separation does occur in the laminar case, it is very thin and the anticipated impact on the boundary-layer health is not seen. In fact, an equilibrium turbulent boundary layer is recovered far sooner downstream and is thinner than in the tripped cases, which exhibit attached turbulent interactions. In summary, normal shock wave–laminar boundary-layer interactions did not exhibit the anticipated detrimental effects, and instead appear quite benign.",56,6

The computational domain is segregated into Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and large-eddy simulation regions. An upwind convective flux discretization method and shear-stress transport turbulence models are applied to the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes region, and the low-dissipative convective flux discretization method and improved delayed detached-eddy simulation are applied to the large-eddy simulation region. To generate turbulence at the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation interface, a synthetic-eddy method is employed. The geometries and boundary conditions of the model scramjet combustor are based on an experiment conducted at German Aerospace Center. The turbulent hydrogen diffusion flame is modeled using the steady flamelet approach. A total of nine computation cases are examined to analyze the influence of the numerical methods.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056539,"A flamelet-based combustion model is proposed for the prediction of wall heat transfer in rocket engines and confined combustion systems. To account for convective heat loss due to the interaction of the flame with the wall, a permeable thermal boundary condition is introduced in the counterflow diffusion flame configuration. The solution of the resulting nonadiabatic flame structure forms a three-dimensional manifold, which is parameterized in terms of mixture fraction, progress variable, and temperature. The performance of the model is first evaluated through a direct numerical simulation analysis of an diffusion flame that is stabilized at an inert isothermal wall. The developed nonadiabatic flamelet model is shown to accurately predict the temperature, chemical composition, and wall heat transfer. Combined with a presumed probability density function closure, the model is then applied to large-eddy simulation of a single-injector rocket combustor to examine effects of heat transfer on the turbulent flame structure in rocket engines.",56,6
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056858,"Inlet distortion is typically encountered during off-design conditions on civil aircraft and in S-ducts in military aircraft. It is known to cause severe deterioration to the performance of a gas-turbine engine. As intakes become shorter, there is an increased interaction between the inlet distortion and the downstream fan. Previous studies in the literature use Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes or unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes to model this unsteady interaction, due to the substantial computational cost associated with high-fidelity methods such as large-eddy simulation/direct numerical simulation. On the other hand, it is well known that turbulence models have limitations in terms of predicting distorted flows. In this paper, a mixed-fidelity approach is proposed and employed to study the intake–fan interaction at an affordable computational cost. The results demonstrate that there are two mechanisms via which the fan affects the separated flow. First, the suction effect of the fan (effective up to almost half of the chord length upstream of the fan) alleviates the undesired distortion by “directly” changing the streamline curvature, intensifying the turbulence transport and closing the recirculation bubble much earlier. Second, the enhanced turbulence in the vicinity of the fan feeds back into the initial growth of the shear layer by means of the recirculating flow. This “indirect” feedback is found to increase turbulence production during the initial stages of formation of the shear layer. Both the direct and indirect effects of the fan significantly suppress the inlet distortion.",56,6

This approach is able to accurately and efficiently predict the unsteady aerodynamics, boundary-layer separation, lift and drag, and the stress and structural deformation of the flexible membrane wing. The focus of this paper is on the systematic validation of this coupled solver for a specific membrane configuration, where extensive experimental measurements are available. Comparisons between the present simulations and experiments are made for the following quantities: 1) mean membrane shape; 2) dominant membrane oscillating frequencies under various conditions; 3) flowfield visualizations; 4) instantaneous velocity field; 5) membrane displacement response to instantaneous flowfield; 6) use of rigid and flexible membranes; 7) distribution of mean velocity field; and 8) distribution of turbulence intensity.

Thanks to the wall model, at the present Reynolds number, the grid spacing and the time-step size are increased by one order of magnitude compared with the traditional wall-resolved large-eddy simulation, and the high-fidelity large-eddy simulation can be applied to the buffet phenomena, which include the very low-frequency shock-wave oscillation. The results demonstrate the capability of the present wall-modeled large-eddy simulation for predicting the buffet phenomena. The present wall-modeled large-eddy simulation successfully predicts the buffet onset in the Mach number sweep, the buffet frequency, and turbulence statistics without the use of any ad hoc corrections.

The approach is limited to large-aspect-ratio wings that can be discretized into multiple, streamwise, independent strips; and the well-documented “strip theory” with sweep corrections is applicable. This formulation allows the extension of Leishman’s indicial functions (“Validation of Approximate Indicial Aerodynamic Functions for Two-Dimensional Subsonic Flow,” Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 25, No. 10, 1988, pp. 914–922) to three-dimensional wings but also restricts the present method to attached flows. However, when supported with two-dimensional steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations, the present method predicts flutter speeds that are within 10% of that predicted by two-dimensional time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Application of the proposed method for a large-aspect-ratio wing is validated by comparing the predicted flutter boundary against wind-tunnel experiments. More importantly, the current method predicts the transonic dip phenomena observed in the experiments but not predicted by NASTRAN analysis. This is achieved at several orders-of-magnitude lower computation time than high-fidelity time-accurate computational fluid dynamics simulations. The level of accuracy obtained at such an extremely low computation time makes the present approach very suitable for applications in conceptual design studies of large-aspect-ratio transonic vehicles.",56,6

Coupling among disciplines contributes significantly to the computational cost of analyzing a system and can become particularly burdensome when coupled analyses are embedded within a design or optimization loop. In many cases, disciplines may be weakly coupled, so that some of the coupling or interaction terms can be neglected without significantly impacting the accuracy of the system output. Typical practice derives such approximations in an ad hoc manner using expert opinion and domain experience. This work proposes a new approach that formulates an optimization problem to find a model that optimally balances accuracy of the model outputs with the sparsity of the discipline couplings.

As a specific example, the spatiotemporal evolution of the flowfields in swirl injectors is considered. The prediction accuracy of the mean flow features for new swirl injector designs is assessed, and the flow dynamics is captured in the form of power spectrum densities. The framework also demonstrates the uncertainty quantification of predictions, providing a metric for model fit.

However, uncertainties are unavoidable in the design of active control systems. Thus, in the design process of an LQR controller, it is important to deal with these uncertainties, which are always bounded and have a great influence on the final performance of the closed-loop system. In this paper, the nonprobabilistic reliability concept is extended to the selection of weighting matrices for determining the LQR controller. First, a new uncertainty propagation analysis method for an active control system is presented. To adapt to the special problem of controller design, a novel nonprobabilistic reliability index is proposed. The reliability and safety margin of the closed-loop system can be continuously characterized by this modified nonprobabilistic reliability index. The weighing matrices used to design the LQR controller via the Riccati equation are finally determined by solving a reliability-based optimization problem. The proposed method preserves the excellent characteristics of LQR control theory and provides a quantitative method for selecting the weight matrices for LQR controller design in consideration of the inherent uncertainties. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.
