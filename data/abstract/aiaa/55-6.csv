Computations use the US3D Navier–Stokes solver to simulate Mach 6 flow at Reynolds numbers of and , which are conditions used by quiet-tunnel experiments at Purdue University. Distributed roughness with point-to-point height variation on the computational grid and maximum heights of is used with the intent to emulate smooth-body transition and excite the naturally occurring most unstable disturbance wavenumber. Cases at the low-Reynolds number condition use three grid sizes, and hence three different roughness patterns, and demonstrate that the exact flow solution is dependent on the particular roughness pattern. The same roughness pattern is interpolated onto each grid, which yields similar solutions, indicating grid convergence. A steady physical mechanism is introduced for the sharp increase in wall heat flux seen in both computations and experiment at the high-Reynolds number condition. Evolution of disturbance spanwise wavelength is computed, and is found to be more sensitive to Reynolds number than roughness, indicating that the disturbance wavelength is primarily the naturally occurring, flow-selected wavelength for these cases.",55,6

Methods to identify and track these features are necessary for characterizing the flowfield, and robust detection methods could be exploited as an aerodynamic flow control sensor. This paper details a new approach to detect and track near-wall vortices by applying crease detection methods to locate their signatures in a wall static pressure field. The method is used to locate vortex signatures in pressure-sensitive paint measurements on the upper surface of a delta wing and to track the movement of a vortex downstream of a micro vortex generator using a grid of discrete pressure taps. The latter case demonstrates that the position of a near-wall vortex could be tracked experimentally using a coarse wall pressure distribution.",55,6

At the exit of a pipe nozzle of diameter , the jet is characterized by a nozzle pressure ratio of 4.03, an exit Mach number of 1, a fully expanded Mach number of 1.56, and a Reynolds number of . Four distances between the nozzle and the plate of , , , and are considered. Snapshots of vorticity, density, pressure, and mean velocity flowfields are first presented. The latter results compare well with data of the literature. In three cases, in particular, a Mach disk appears to form just upstream from the plate. The convection velocity of flow structures between the nozzle and the plate, and its dependence on the nozzle-to-plate distance, are then examined. The properties of the jet near pressure fields are subsequently described using Fourier analysis. Tones emerge in the spectra at frequencies consistent with those expected for an aeroacoustic feedback loop between the nozzle and the plate as well as with measurements. Their amplitudes are particularly high in the presence of a near-wall Mach disk. The axisymmetric or helical natures of the jet oscillations at the tone frequencies are determined. The motions of the Mach disk found just upstream from the plate for certain nozzle-to-plate distances are then explored. As noted for the jet oscillations, axially pulsing and helical motions are observed, in agreement with experiments. Finally, the intermittency of the tone intensities is studied. They significantly vary in time, except for the two cases where the near-wall Mach disk has a nearly periodic motion at the dominant tone frequency.",55,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055137,"A co-simulation strategy for modeling the unsteady dynamics of flying insects and small birds as well as biologically inspired flapping-wing micro-air-vehicles is developed in this work. In particular, the dynamic system under study is partitioned in two subsystems (the structural model and the aerodynamic model) that exchange information in a strong way. The vehicle or insect system is modeled as a collection of rigid bodies and lifting surfaces that can undergo deformations such as spanwise twisting, in-plane bending, out-of-plane bending, and an arbitrary combination of these deformation mechanisms. To account for the loads associated with the airflow, an aerodynamic model based on an extended version of the unsteady vortex-lattice method is used. The motion equations are integrated by using a fourth-order predictor-corrector method along with a procedure to stabilize the solution of the resulting differential-algebraic equations. The numerical results obtained for the unsteady lift and dynamics of a fruit fly in free hover flight are found to be in close agreement with prior experimental results reported in the literature. Furthermore, the inclusion of an adequate wing deformation pattern results in an increase of the lift force compared with that of a rigid wing surface, pointing to the importance of wing flexibility on aerodynamic performance. From the findings reported in this paper, it is believed that the numerical simulation framework presented here could serve as a computational tool for further studies of flying insects and micro-air-vehicles.",55,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054407,"Tethered lifting bodies have attracted significant attention from surveillance, communications, and (most recently) wind energy domains. As with many aerospace systems, the costs of full-scale testing act as a bottleneck to development, especially when accurate dynamic models do not exist, as is the case with a number of lifting-body designs that deviate from the traditional aerostat shape. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of using a laboratory-scale water channel-based test platform for the dynamic characterization of tethered systems with rigid lifting bodies, focusing on a lighter-than-air wind energy system as a case study. The platform overcomes the financial burden of full-scale testing, which simultaneously alleviates the short-term need for high-fidelity dynamic models and aids in the long-term development of high-fidelity models. In this paper, it is shown how a dimensional analysis provides a qualitative correlation between full-scale and th-scale flight behavior, as well as how this laboratory-scale platform is used to evaluate different lifting-body designs.",55,6

This study investigated a flat-plate body with an elliptic leading edge and blunt trailing edge, with and without trailing-edge spanwise sinusoidal perturbation. Base-pressure measurements were used to quantify the base-drag reduction associated with spanwise sinusoidal perturbation. In addition, particle-image-velocimetry measurements were performed in the near wake with and without spanwise sinusoidal perturbation, and a proper-orthogonal-decomposition analysis was used to analyze the velocity data. The findings suggest that the spanwise sinusoidal perturbation redistributed the relative kinetic energy, which enhanced the streamwise vortices and suppressed the von Kármán–Bénard vortices as a result.",55,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055560,"Tri-electrode plasma actuator (TED-PA), which has a third electrode with DC high voltage, can generate stronger jet than that of conventional two-electrode plasma actuator. However, the behavior of the jet in TED-PA is totally different from that in a conventional plasma actuator; the induced jet is deflected upward. To clarify the jet deflection mechanism and performance improvement mechanism of TED-PA, the discharge plasma and flow field are numerically simulated. The results show that the jet deflection appears in both cases of negative and positive DC voltage; a rightward jet from the AC electrode and a leftward jet from the DC electrode are generated, and the collision of the two jets generates the upward jet. The jet becomes stronger by the DC high voltage due to two factors: negative body force generation around the DC electrode and positive body force enhancement around the AC electrode. The negative body force generation results from the drift motion of the positive ions in the positive DC voltage case, and, on the other hand, that of the negative ions in the negative DC voltage case. The positive force enhancement is due to the electric field intensification by the DC voltage.",55,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055354,"The ability of vortex generators to reduce the unsteady distortion at the exit plane of an S duct is investigated. The three components of the velocity at the aerodynamic interface plane were measured using a stereo particle velocimetry system with high spatial resolution. This enabled an assessment of the synchronous swirl distortion at the duct exit. A total of nine vortex generator cases have been investigated with a systematic variation of key design variables. Overall, the vortex generators change the duct secondary flows and separation and are able to substantially restructure the flowfield at the aerodynamic interface plane. The pressure distortion could be reduced up to 50%, and a reduction in pressure loss of 30% was achieved for the mean flowfield. The vortex generators had a substantial influence on the unsteadiness of the flowfield with a reduction in peak swirl unsteadiness of 61% and an overall reduction of unsteady swirl distortion of 67%. They also suppressed the primary unsteady flow switching mechanism of the datum configuration, which is associated with the oscillation of bulk and twin swirl regimes. Consequently, extreme events that lead to high swirl intensity are suppressed, which lower by 45% the maximum swirl intensity for the vortex generator cases.",55,6

Therefore, there is a need for a better understanding of the complex characteristics of the distorted flow at the exit of S-shaped intakes. This work presents a detailed analysis of the unsteady swirl distortion based on synchronous, high-spatial-resolution measurements using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. Two S-duct configurations with different centerline offsets are investigated. The high-offset duct shows greater levels of dynamic and steady swirl distortion and a notably greater tendency toward bulk swirl patterns associated with high swirl distortion. More discrete distortion patterns with locally high swirl levels and the potential to impact the engine operability are identified. The most energetic coherent structures of the flowfield are observed using proper orthogonal decomposition. A switching mode is identified that promotes the alternating swirl switching mechanism and is mostly associated with the occurrence of potent bulk swirl events. A vertical mode that characterizes a perturbation of the vertical velocity field promotes most of the twin swirl flow distortion topologies. It is postulated that it is associated with the unsteadiness of the centerline shear layer.",55,6

There is a need for a better understanding of the main flow mechanisms that promote flow distortion at the exit of S-shaped intakes. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the main coherent structures in an S-duct flowfield based on a delayed detached-eddy simulation. The capability of this numerical approach to capture the characteristics of the highly unsteady flowfield is demonstrated against high-resolution, synchronous stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements at the aerodynamic interface plane. The flowfield mechanisms responsible for the main perturbations at the duct outlet are identified. Clockwise and counterclockwise streamwise vortices are alternately generated around the separation region at a frequency of , which promote the swirl switching at the duct outlet. Spanwise vortices are also shed from the separation region at a frequency of and convect downstream along the separated centerline shear layer. This results in a vertical modulation of the main loss region and a fluctuation of the velocity gradient between the high- and low-velocity flow at the aerodynamic interface plane.",55,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055395,"This paper proposes a family of high-pressure capturing wing configurations that aim to improve the aerodynamic performance of hypersonic vehicles with large volumes. The predominant visual feature of such configurations is a thin wing called a high-pressure capturing wing attached to the top of an upwarp airframe. When flying in the hypersonic regime, high-pressure airflow compressed by the upper surface of the vehicle acts on the high-pressure capturing wing and significantly augments lift on the vehicle with only a small increase in drag, producing a correspondingly high increase in its lift-to-drag ratio. A series of numerical validations were carried out on the basis of both inviscid and viscous computational models in which ideal cones with different cone angles and combined cone–waverider bodies with different volumes were used as airframes. The results clearly demonstrate that a configuration using a high-pressure capturing wing has a significantly higher lift (with a correspondingly high value of lift-to-drag ratio) than one without a high-pressure capturing wing, especially for vehicles with large volumes. This paper contains a preliminary, results-based report of the conditions under which high-pressure capturing wing configurations were tested.",55,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055463,"A method to estimate buffeting loads on lifting surfaces immersed in turbulent streams using steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation solutions is presented. A generalization of a model developed by Liepmann (“On the Application of Statistical Concepts to the Buffeting Problem,” Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 19, No. 12, Dec. 1952, pp. 793–800.) that is based on thin airfoil theory and statistical concepts is employed. Mean flow and turbulence-derived quantities required by the method are supplied by steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation model data. The shear-stress transport turbulence model is used here. The predictive capability of the method is assessed by comparison to unsteady turbulence simulations of the stream buffeting the lifting surface. A half-step is also taken wherein turbulence simulation results are used to close the Liepmann model, allowing that model’s performance to be isolated from the impact of using a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model. The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye rotodome exposed to a compressible turbulent plume is used as a test case. The half-step results show that the Liepmann model itself performs well when both the upper and lower surfaces of the rotodome are within the stream. Estimates obtained using steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation-based results within the Liepmann model compare less favorably due to mean flow prediction differences. But, they are reasonable and have been found to be useful in an environment where a large number of cases needs to be quickly analyzed.",55,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055172,"High-fidelity computational modeling and optimization of aircraft configurations have the potential to enable engineers to create more efficient designs that require fewer unforeseen modifications late in the design process. Although aerodynamic shape optimization has the potential to produce high-performance transonic wing designs, these designs remain susceptible to buffet. To address this issue, a separation-based constraint formulation is developed that constrains buffet onset in an aerodynamic shape optimization. This separation metric is verified against a common buffet prediction method and validated against experimental wind-tunnel data. A series of optimizations based on the AIAA Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group’s wing–body–tail case are presented to show that buffet-onset constraints are required and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Although both single-point and multipoint optimizations without separation constraints are vulnerable to buffeting, the optimizations using the proposed approach move the buffet boundary to make the designs feasible.",55,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055475,"The numerical prediction of transition from laminar to turbulent flow has proven to be an arduous challenge for computational fluid dynamics, with few approaches providing routine accurate results within the cost confines of engineering applications. The recently proposed transition model shows promise for predicting attached and mildly separated boundary layers in the transitional regime, but its accuracy diminishes for massively separated flows. In this effort, a new turbulence closure is proposed that combines the strengths of the local dynamic kinetic energy model and the widely adopted transition model using an additive hybrid filtering approach. This method has the potential for accurately capturing massively separated boundary layers in the transitional Reynolds number range at a reasonable computational cost. Comparisons are evaluated on several cases, including a transitional flat plate, NACA 63-415 wing, and circular cylinder in crossflow. The new closure captures the physics associated with a separated wake (circular cylinder) across a range of Reynolds numbers from 10 to 2 million and performed significantly better in capturing performance and flowfield features of engineering interest than existing turbulence models. The transitional hybrid approach is numerically robust and requires less than 2% extra computational work per iteration as compared with the baseline Langtry–Menter transition model.",55,6
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055563,"A proper-orthogonal-decomposition analysis was performed on the turbulent flow in the near-wake region of an S805 airfoil in deep stall at an angle of attack of 30 deg. The flow was measured using tomographic particle image velocimetry at a Reynolds number of 4600. Instantaneous turbulence structures, which were significant contributors to the first two proper-orthogonal-decomposition modes, were studied. These structures included the large-scale Kármán vortex and small-scale shear-layer vortices that were interacting with the Kármán vortex. An interesting correspondence was observed between the rotational vectors in proper-orthogonal-decomposition modes 4 and 5 and the locations of the leading-edge shear-layer vortices in the flowfields, which were major contributors to these two modes. Similarity was found in the autospectral functions computed from the velocity fields, which were significant contributors to the first five proper-orthogonal-decomposition modes. The wavelengths corresponding to the peak values of autospectral functions could be related to the size of the induced flows by the Kármán vortex and the streamwise spacing of the shear-layer vortices.",55,6
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054961,"The efficiency and accuracy of viscous flow simulations depend crucially on the quality of the boundary-layer mesh. Too coarse meshes can result in inaccurate predictions and in some cases lead to numerical instabilities, whereas too fine meshes produce accurate predictions at the expense of long simulation times. Constructing an optimal (or near-optimal) boundary-layer mesh has been recognized as an important problem in computational fluid dynamics. For few simple flows, one may be able to construct such a mesh a priori before simulation. For most viscous flow simulations, however, it is difficult to generate such mesh in advance. In this paper, a boundary-layer adaptivity method is developed for the efficient computation of steady viscous flows. This method turns the problem of determining the location of the mesh nodes into a set of equations that are solved simultaneously with the flow equations. The mesh equations are designed so that the boundary-layer mesh adapts to the viscous layers as the flow solver marches toward the converged solution. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance of the method.",55,6

Line-based reconstruction schemes and approximate factorization techniques are robustly implemented on unstructured grids. The Baldwin–Lomax and Spalart–Allmaras turbulence models are integrated to the present method for both two- and three-dimensional flows, and the predicted aerodynamic flows are validated by comparing against those obtained from established solvers and/or experiments. In addition, time-accurate methods with dual-time-stepping strategies are explored to predict flows over canonical time-dependent problems. It is observed that a various high-order-type reconstruction scheme can be used on “lines” constructed from purely unstructured grids in the current framework, along with good spatial and temporal accuracy.",55,6
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055366,"A novel procedure for the Riemann solver flux calculation is proposed in this paper. With this simple normal velocity reconstruction procedure, all of the commonly used flux solvers (such as Godunov, Roe, Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact, Advection-Upstream-Splitting-Method, etc.) turn out to be carbuncle-free and shock-stable. The normal velocity reconstruction procedure is done by a linear reconstruction of the cell interface normal velocity with the transverse neighbor cells, in consideration of the information transport in the transverse direction, which is neglected in the conventional finite volume/difference method. Some typical cases are performed to show that, when the normal velocity reconstruction procedure is used, various schemes (e.g., Roe) become carbuncle-free and shock-stable. In addition, the normal velocity reconstruction procedure has no influence on the contact-preserving property of the original flux solvers, and it adds very little computational cost. The mechanism of the normal velocity reconstruction procedure also is analyzed by a matrix-based stability method, and the results indicate that the normal velocity reconstruction procedure effectively reduces the system’s positive eigenvalues that are leading to shock instability.",55,6

Time-resolved wall pressure measurements are used as primary diagnostics. The statistical analysis reveals that the shock unsteadiness has common features in terms of the standard deviation of the pressure fluctuations with other classical shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions, like compression ramps and incident shocks on a flat plate. The Fourier transform and the continuous wavelet transform are used to conduct the spectral analysis. The results of the former indicate that the pressure in the shock region is characterized by a broad low-frequency content, without any resonant tone. The wavelet analysis, which is well suited to study non stationary process, reveals that the pressure signal is characterized by an amplitude and a frequency modulation in time.",55,6
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055226,"Focus boom occurs when a flight vehicle accelerates or maneuvers at supersonic speed. Its overpressure is typically more than three times greater than that of a cruise boom. As a result, future supersonic transports are likely to face restrictions on their flight conditions. To investigate ways to alleviate this problem, this paper presents the effects of the focusing of several sonic boom signatures. So-called low-boom waveforms have promising characteristics, not only in cruise but also in transition flight phases including acceleration from Mach 1. Computations of the focused waveform for several accelerations at a constant altitude reveal that the low-boom ramp and flattop waveforms show strong reductions of the peak overpressure and perceived level measured on the ground track of the aircraft. Acceleration strongly impacts on the size of the noise exposure footprint of the focus boom, whereas the peak overpressure and the metric are not sensitive. Also shown is the importance of applying the low-boom concept to not only the front but also the rear section of the boom signature.",55,6
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055386,"Thermomechanical concepts and modeling are used to describe the response of inert and reactive gases to transient, spatially resolved thermal energy deposition. The ultimate goal is to establish the cause–effect relationship between combustion-generated energy deposition and the mechanical disturbances responsible for operationally observed pressure oscillations in liquid-propellant rocket engine combustion chambers as well as to identify physical processes that convert thermal energy to kinetic energy. Asymptotic formulations of the nondimensional describing transient conservation equations for both inert and reactive gases are used to identify nondimensional parameters that characterize fundamental physics occurring as the gas responds to localized heating. The characteristics of the responses depend upon the magnitudes of the suite of parameters. Some are described by hyperbolic partial differential equations; others involve either nearly constant density or nearly isobaric phenomena. Thermomechanical concepts are used to explain how initially imposed small pressure, density, temperature, and velocity disturbances can be the sources of a thermal response that evolves to relatively larger thermomechanical disturbances. The competition between localized, spatially distributed chemical energy addition from a high-activation-energy, one-step, Arrhenius reaction and compressibility effects associated with localized gas compression/expansion is the driver for diverse outcomes. Sufficiently robust thermal energy addition can cause a thermal explosion after an induction time period, followed by relatively large changes in the thermodynamic variables and induced velocity (instability) on a time scale exponentially short compared to that of the induction time.",55,6

Computational-fluid-dynamics simulations have been carried out to predict three-dimensional large-amplitude liquid sloshing in spherical tanks. Basically an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method is followed. The main challenges are tracking the motion of the contact line and free surface, defining the nodal velocities on the space curved wall boundary, and maintaining rational computational mesh at the same time. A novel mesh moving strategy is presented to update the mesh and meanwhile to suppress the mesh distortion. The mesh nodes on the free surface and contact line are restricted to move along prescribed orbits, and the nodes on the container wall are moved by an algebraic mesh moving algorithm.

22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055547,"One of the most important branches of applied mechanics is the theory of plates—defined to be plane structural elements whose thickness is very small when compared to the two planar dimensions. There is an abundance of plate models in the literature owing to advantages such as reduced computational effort and a simpler, yet elegant, resulting mathematical formulation. Recently, there has been a steady growth of interest in modeling materials with microstructure that exhibit length-scale dependent behavior, generally known as Cosserat elastic materials. Traditional plate models derived from classical elasticity theory, such as the Reissner–Mindlin type, are incapable of accounting for such length-scale effects, which can only be predicted when one starts from a higher-order elasticity theory. The objective of this work is the formulation of a theory of Cosserat elastic plates. The mathematical foundation of the approach used is the variational asymptotic method, a powerful tool used to construct asymptotically correct reduced-dimensional models. Unlike existing Cosserat plate models in the literature, the variational asymptotic method allows for a plate formulation that is free of ad hoc assumptions regarding the kinematics. The result is a systematic derivation of the two-dimensional constitutive relations and a set of geometrically exact, fully intrinsic equations governing the motion of a plate. An important consequence is the extraction of the so-called drilling stiffness associated with the drilling degree of freedom. This stiffness cannot be extracted from classical elasticity theory and is therefore only associated with higher-order elasticity theories. The present approach connects the two-dimensional Cosserat plate theory with a three-dimensional elasticity theory, in stark contrast to the usual approach of regarding the Cosserat plate theory as phenomenological and thus disconnected from the three-dimensional world.",55,6

In the probabilistic analysis of composite structures, one important quantity that can be subject to scatter is the ply or fiber orientation of the layers. Laminates with a large number of plies lead to a large number of random variables, which makes the probabilistic analysis very time consuming. Lamination parameters allow describing any ply layup by a maximum of 12 parameters. They have therefore been used for the design optimization of thick laminates. In the current paper, a two-step procedure is considered for using lamination parameters for probabilistic analyses of composite structures with many plies. In the first step, the stochastic distribution of lamination parameters is determined. In the second step, the actual probabilistic analysis is performed. A closed-form solution for the stochastic moment of lamination parameters is presented. Furthermore, the paper discusses under which circumstances lamination parameters are approximately normally distributed, which allows increasing the efficiency of both steps.",55,6

According to the coupon tests, we find that shallow biangle fibers and thin plies can increase the axial stiffness of laminates significantly at the cost of a relatively small decrease in their transverse and shear moduli. For the structural tests, we fabricate composite wing structures using an out-of-autoclave vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. By conducting static bending tests, we show superior structural performances of the wing structure that employs shallow biangle fibers and thin-ply fabric, compared to those that use conventional fiber-angle and thick plies.

However, in the traditional shell analysis, mathematically two-dimensional thin-shell theories or higher-order thick-shell theories, which make very limiting assumptions about the displacement variation through the shell thickness, have usually applied. Although most researchers have used three-dimensional shell coordinates that are normal and tangent to the shell midsurface, the present analysis is based upon the circular cylindrical coordinates. Using the Ritz method, the Legendre polynomials, which are mathematically orthonormal, are used as admissible functions instead of ordinary simple algebraic polynomials. The potential and kinetic energies of the hermetic capsule are formulated, and upper bound values of the frequencies are obtained by minimizing the frequencies. As the degree of the Legendre polynomials is increased, frequencies converge to the exact values. Convergence to four-digit exactitude is demonstrated for the first five frequencies. The frequencies from the present three-dimensional method are compared with those from other three-dimensional approaches and two-dimensional shell theories by previous researchers.
