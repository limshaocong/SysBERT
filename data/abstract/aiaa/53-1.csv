The Sikorsky Prize required a human-powered helicopter to sustain flight for 60 s, momentarily reach a height of 3 m, and maintain position within a 10-by-10-m area. A configuration study was undertaken using low-fidelity aerodynamic analysis and estimated mass figures. An aerostructural optimization framework was developed for rotor design, including a novel vortex-ring aerodynamic model with included ground effect prediction, finite element analysis including integrated composite failure analysis, and a detailed weight estimation scheme. The airframe comprised a wire-braced truss structure, and innovative designs were developed for many of the aircraft’s lightweight-focused subsystems. After initial flight testing in August 2012, experimental optimization and performance improvement led to a second testing program beginning in January 2013. Testing in 2013 led to a reduction in required power, and improved understanding of the structural dynamics and control strategy. The project culminated with the successful American Helicopter Society Sikorsky Prize flight on 13 June 2013.",53,1

It is shown analytically that the circulatory-pressure integral over the surface of a lifting body of thickness recovers the lift generating Kutta–Joukowski theorem in the far field, and results in Maskell’s formula for the vortex-induced drag plus an additional pressure-loss term that tends to zero for an infinitely thin wake. A Poisson equation for the circulatory-pressure field is implemented as a transport equation into the FLUENT 13 solver. Numerical examples include a circular cylinder at , the S809 airfoil at , and the ONERA M6 wing at . It is shown that the circulatory-pressure field does indeed behave as an inviscid pressure field of a fully viscous solution, and provides insight into the nature of pressure drag and its contributions to local form and vortex-induced drag.",53,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051696,"Two deterministic incompressible flow solvers are coupled with a nonintrusive stochastic collocation method to propagate several aerodynamic uncertainties of the same type encountered in a standard trailing-edge noise experiment of a low-speed controlled-diffusion airfoil to predict the far-field noise. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and large-eddy simulations are applied to a common restricted domain surrounding the airfoil embedded in the potential core of the jet in the anechoic wind-tunnel experiment. Both simulation methods provide the wall-pressure fluctuations near the airfoil trailing edge, which are then used in Amiet’s acoustic analogy for trailing-edge noise. In the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations, two different representative models are used to reconstruct the wall-pressure fluctuations: Rozenberg’s deterministic model directly based on integral boundary-layer parameters, and Panton and Linebarger’s statistical model based on the velocity field in the boundary layer. The nonintrusive stochastic model is solved in a stochastic collocation framework, with the inlet velocity profiles as random variables. This framework is found to be two orders of magnitude more efficient than a classical Monte Carlo simulation for the same accuracy. Comparisons of the mean and standard deviations of the wall-pressure spectra and the far-field acoustic pressure with experiment stress that Rozenberg’s model is more accurate at low frequencies and has larger uncertainties at high frequencies because of the uncertainty on the wall shear stress and that Panton and Linerbarger’s is less accurate at low frequencies because of the slow statistical convergence of the integration involved in the model.",53,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052380,"For the last 10 years, large-eddy simulations have become a major tool for investigating jet noise sources because of their intrinsic ability to capture broadband turbulent features. However, many challenges still arise when dealing with complex geometries in terms of method accuracy and computational costs. Two different approaches to compute jet noise in an industrial context are here validated and compared. Both approaches are based on a hybrid methodology combining large-eddy simulation of jet flows for sources computations and Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings’s analogy for far-field noise prediction, but they differ on their grid topologies. The first approach uses classical block structured grids. The numerical scheme is a low-dispersive, low-dissipative finite-volume compact scheme. The second approach uses fully unstructured tetrahedral grids with a low-dispersive, low-dissipative Taylor–Galerkin finite-element scheme. Both approaches are used to compute a Mach 0.9 cold jet at the moderate Reynolds number without accounting for the nozzle geometry. Comparisons between simulations and experimental measurements highlight the need to correctly capture the initial turbulent development of the mixing layer at the nozzle exit. In the present simulations, because the nozzle geometry is not discretized, the turbulent transition is done by injecting perturbations as vortex-ring modes. Results obtained on this benchmark test case demonstrate the capability of both methods to correctly simulate and predict jet noise. The validation of the approach using fully tetrahedral grids provides a promising way to account for complex noise-reduction devices such as chevrons, realistic dual-stream nozzles, or lobed mixers.",53,1

The flow is at Mach 6.4, and a case with an angle of attack of 28 deg is considered. The interest is in predictions of afterbody heating in the presence of massive separation and the resultant highly unsteady wake flow. Detached-eddy simulations of this flowfield are done using several flux schemes, and the effect of mesh refinement is considered. The results are compared to experimental data for mean and fluctuating heat transfer in the separated portion of the afterbody. Comparisons of instantaneous flow features are presented to illustrate varying levels of resolved scales.",53,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052874,"An analytical approach is presented to model the broadband unsteady force cross-correlations exerted on a rotor due to a spatially homogeneous turbulent inflow. In addition, the rotor unsteady force cross-correlation matrix is treated as a set of correlated, compact dipole acoustic sources to predict the low-frequency radiated sound field of a subsonic rotor ingesting a turbulent flow. It is shown that turbulence-induced rotor forces in the radial and axial directions are uncorrelated for the special condition when spatially homogeneous turbulence is ingested, and further it is shown that radial-to-axial force correlation can exist when the turbulent inflow velocity field contains a coherent once-per-revolution variation. Equations to estimate rotor turbulence ingestion sound from noncompact dipole sources are also developed for situations when the compact acoustic assumption is invalid. A numerical simulation of the turbulence force and acoustic response for a 10-bladed rotor ingesting a spatially homogeneous turbulent inflow closely match an available experimental data set. A numerical simulation was also performed for a variation in rotor blade pitch, which indicated that radial force dipole source strength becomes nearly comparable to axial force dipole source strength when the blade-tip pitch angle reaches a value of .",53,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053014,"While operating in an overexpanded condition, rocket nozzles exhibit dynamic off-axis loads caused by asymmetric internal flow separation. It has been demonstrated that topologies, which only display free shock separation, produce side-load magnitudes lower than those that can transition to restricted shock separation. It is therefore suggested that geometries such as truncated ideal contour nozzles could be used on launchers with large-area-ratio designs providing improved vacuum performance. Part of the challenge of designing nozzles to operate in the overexpanded regime is characterizing and quantifying associated side loads. This paper presents the methodology and results of an analytical model that simulates side loads induced by free shock separation. The pressure distribution within a separated rocket nozzle is produced using free interaction theory, and a spring–damper analogy is used to model shock fluctuations in response to external pressure disturbances. Good agreement has been found between simulated side loads and experimentally measured forces on four conical and one truncated ideal contour nozzle.",53,1

While considering multiple flight conditions in the optimization improves the robustness of the designs, there is a need to develop a way of choosing the flight conditions and their relative emphases such that multipoint optimizations reflect the true objective function. In addition, there is a need to consider uncertain missions and flight conditions. To address this, a new strategy to formulate multipoint design optimization problems is developed that can maximize the aircraft performance over a large number of different missions. This new strategy is applied to the high-fidelity aerostructural optimization of a long-range twin-aisle aircraft with the objective of minimizing the fuel burn over all the missions it performs in one year. This is accomplished by determining 25 flight conditions and their respective emphases on drag and structural weight that emulate the fuel-burn minimization for over 100,000 missions. The design optimization is based on the computational fluid dynamics of a full aircraft configuration coupled to a detailed finite element model of the wing structure, enabling the simultaneous optimization of wing aerodynamic shape and structural sizing leading to optimal static aeroelastic tailoring. A coupled adjoint method in conjunction with a gradient-based optimizer enable optimization with respect to 311 design variables subject to 152 constraints. Given the high computational cost of the aerostructural analysis, kriging models are used to evaluate the multiple missions. The results show that the multipoint optimized design reduced the total fuel burn by 6.6%, while the single-point optimization reduced it by only 1.7%. This capability to analyze large numbers of flight conditions and missions and to reduce the multimission problem to a multipoint problem could be used with a few modifications to minimize the expected value of any objective function given the probability density functions of the flight conditions.",53,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053021,"For many applications (e.g., in aircraft engines), the cells of Helmholtz resonator liners are not solely locally reacting because drainage slots are cut into the side walls. However, for the design of liners, the resulting effects of such drainage slots are currently not taken into account. Therefore, this paper presents a study on the effects of liner-cell interaction. In the first part, experimental results for different slot configurations of a generic test object (the scaled liner cavity) are shown and discussed. The major result is an additional dissipation maximum caused by the cell interaction. Based on these findings, an empirical relation is derived incorporating geometrical parameters like the percentage open area ratio to predict the appearance of the additional maximum.",53,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053027,"An experimental investigation was carried out to study the propagation of a shock wave through a crossover tube for the purpose of causing shock-initiated detonation. A pulse detonation engine was used as a driver source to propagate a shock wave through a crossover tube into a second, adjacent detonation tube (that is, driven). Results showed a transferred shock wave achieved shock-initiated detonation, and for specific crossover tube geometries, there was a maximum effective crossover tube length for which the event was possible. This maximum effective length was strongly correlated to the strength of the transferred shock. Initiation performance in the driven detonation tube declined when the incident shock strength decreased below . Introducing a bend to the end of the crossover tube increased the driven detonation tube initiation performance by enhancing the strength of the transferred planar shock wave by an average of 20%. A numerical investigation on shock wave planar attenuation in a crossover tube corroborated the experimental results.",53,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052986,"An analytical solution to the problem of deformation of a finite dimensional general cross-ply, thick doubly curved panel with negative Gaussian curvature and of rectangular planform, modeled using a higher-order shear deformation theory, is presented. A solution methodology, based on a boundary-discontinuous, generalized double Fourier series approach is used to solve a system of five highly coupled linear partial differential equations, generated by the higher-order shear deformation-theory-based laminated shell analysis, with the C4-type rigidly clamped boundary condition prescribed on two opposite edges, whereas the remaining two edges are subjected to the SS3-type constraint. Hitherto unavailable important numerical results presented include sensitivity of the predicted response quantities of interest to applied loading, shell geometry (negative or positive Gaussian curvature), edge clamping constraints, and lamination and thickness effects, as well as their possible interactions. Comparison with their nonnegative Gaussian curvature counterparts demonstrates the effect of negative Gaussian curvature on the deflections and moments of these doubly curved panels.",53,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053031,"Active control of rotor–stator interaction noise is studied numerically using a locally oscillating stator surface. A stator of 24 blades inside an infinite coaxial duct is considered. The governing equations are linearized three-dimensional Euler equations and solved with an explicit numerical technique based on a high-order approximation of spatial derivatives. A number of parameters governing actuation-induced sound field and control performance are investigated. It is found that the actuation-induced sound field and noise reduction achieved depend on the actuation amplitude and frequency. The side and position, where actuation is imposed, of the blade as well as actuator geometry are also crucial for the control performance. The downstream-radiated sound power may be reduced by 50% or more over a range of frequencies given an optimum combination of control parameters.",53,1

The simple lift formula is given as a useful approximate form that has the vortex force and local acceleration terms. The accuracy of the simple lift formula in lift estimation is quantitatively evaluated in comparison with the general force formulas based on the fully resolved two- and three-dimensional unsteady velocity fields and the planar velocity fields at several spanwise locations in simulated particle-image-velocimetry measurements. In addition, the mathematical connections between the different force formulas are discussed.",53,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053053,"Reusable thermal-protection systems with active cooling, such as transpiration, are among the promising technologies for thermal management of hypersonic vehicles designed as practical, long-range transportation systems. This paper numerically investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of a variable-velocity transpiration technology for fully laminar and fully turbulent hypersonic flows over a two-dimensional blunt leading-edge geometry. For both flow types, variable transpiration based on a sawtooth velocity distribution is compared to a uniform-velocity transpiration approach. An equal amount of coolant has been imposed to compare the cooling effectiveness between two strategies. The results numerically demonstrate the significant reduction in stagnation-point heating and coolant mass savings achievable with the variable-transpiration strategy, which is observed both in laminar and turbulent flows. The transpiration cooling efficiency is shown to be higher in laminar flow compared to turbulent flow downstream of the leading edge (ramp region). In such regions, for turbulent flows, the amount of total coolant must be increased by a factor of 2 to match the cooling efficiency in laminar flows. The thermal response of a porous thermal-protection-system material is investigated in laminar and turbulent flows with variable transpiration to gain important insight about the matrix and coolant behavior in response to external flow.",53,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053026,"The response of a separated flow over a two-dimensional wing to short-duration disturbances from a Lorentz force leading-edge actuator is presented. At a chord Reynolds number of and an angle of attack of , the flow is initially laminar but undergoes transition within the separated shear layer.The transient flow structures and lift force measurements were obtained with varying actuator pulse duration, pulse amplitude, and direction of actuation. The peak amplitude of the lift is shown to depend on the pulse duration when the pulse duration is less than 0.5 convective times, after which it saturates. Saturation of the lift amplitude also occurs when the effective actuator pulse amplitude exceeds . Detailed flow structures that develop in the separated shear layer were identified using the finite-time Lyapunov exponent method. The direction of the actuator pulse has a significant influence on the initial development of the shear layer, but the larger-scale envelope of the separated flow has essentially the same response, irrespective of the direction of actuation. A reconstruction of the velocity field using only three proper orthogonal decomposition modes is sufficient to reproduce the dominant features of the flow response to a single pulse. The second proper orthogonal decomposition mode correlates with the transient lift signal.",53,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053029,"Spectra of wall-pressure fluctuations caused by separation shock unsteadiness were compared for data obtained from wind-tunnel experiments, the Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation flight test 1, and large-eddy simulations. The results were found to be in generally good agreement, despite differences in Mach number and two orders of magnitude difference in Reynolds number. Relatively good agreement was obtained between these spectra and the predictions of a theory developed by Plotkin. The predictions of this theory are also qualitatively consistent with the results of experiments in which the shock motion was synchronized to controlled perturbations. The results presented here support the idea that separation unsteadiness has common features across a broad range of compressible flows and that it behaves as a selective amplifier of large-scale disturbances in the incoming flow.",53,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053064,"A unified framework for surrogate model training point selection and error estimation is proposed. Building auxiliary local surrogate models over subdomains of the global surrogate model forms the basis of the proposed framework. A discrepancy function, defined as the absolute difference between response predictions from local and global surrogate models for randomly chosen test candidates, drives the framework, thereby not requiring any additional exact function evaluations. The benefits of this new approach are demonstrated with analytical test functions and the construction of a two-dimensional aerodynamic database. The results show that the proposed training point selection approach improves the convergence monotonicity and produces more accurate surrogate models compared to random and quasi-random training point selection strategies. The introduced root-mean-square discrepancy and maximum absolute discrepancy exhibit close agreement with the actual root-mean-square error and maximum absolute error, respectively, and are therefore proposed as a measure for the approximation accuracy of surrogate models in applications of practical interest. Multivariate interpolation and regression is employed to build local surrogates, whereas kriging and polynomial chaos expansions serve as global surrogate models in demonstrating the applicability of the proposed framework.",53,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053078,"A scaled-down model experimental setup that exactly replicates a launch vehicle and launch pad for simulating the vehicle liftoff is tested for its aeroacoustic environment. The rocket exhaust consists of twin supersonic hot-air jets of Mach number 3.38. The role of shock noise is investigated in separate single-nozzle freejet and impinging-jet experiments with varying levels of overexpansion. The launch jet noise is suppressed by water jet injection into the exhaust plume for selected locations on the launch pad. Sound reduction up to 9 dB is achieved, and noise suppression continues to be effective up to of vehicle altitude ( being the nozzle-exit diameter). The sound spectra continuously varies from that of impinging jets at the deflector duct and launch table to that of freejets, as the vehicle is lifting off. The noise sources in heated jets respond similar to those in the cold jet, but comparatively higher sound reduction levels are obtained for hot jets in the impinging flow phase of liftoff (less than ). Varying the water injection pressure and mass flow rate show optimal conditions for noise suppression. Injecting water close to the nozzle exit effectively suppresses noise during vehicle liftoff.",53,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053088,"A method to represent complex flow features as geometric entities, using the medial axis for the purpose of generating flow-feature aligned meshes, is presented. These geometric entities are embedded into the domain to influence the generation of unstructured quad-dominant surface meshes in two and three dimensions. The resulting high-quality feature-aligned surface meshes can locally mimic the attributes of a structured grid. This paper also presents a method to extrude shock-aligned quad-dominant surface meshes beyond the boundary layer to cover the extent of transonic shock waves. The process provides a means to embed a high-quality hex-dominant mesh block, aligned with the transonic shock wave, into a hybrid volume mesh for viscous computations. Inclusion of the aligned mesh block is shown to enhance the ability of the hybrid mesh to resolve the shock wave, and thus, improve the numerical solution.",53,1
