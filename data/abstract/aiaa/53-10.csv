0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053422,"This paper presents an experiment of flow control by supersonic pulsed jets in a very aggressive -duct typical of modern fighter aircraft engine inlet ducts. The Mach number in the aerodynamic interface plane ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, which is realistic from an application point of view. It was shown that, with continuous blowing, the flow could be fully reattached. The sensitivity of the distortion coefficient to the jet frequency was also clearly evidenced. Surprisingly, it is recommended to avoid actuating the jets at the natural frequencies present in the separated zone of the uncontrolled flow. Besides, it is observed that pulsed jets actuation increases the unsteady flow distortion. Furthermore, in the uncontrolled flow, a lateral movement of the structures associated with high total pressure losses in the aerodynamic interface plane was highlighted.",53,10
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053473,"The objective of this paper is to develop a simple and robust error estimation method for the flexibility-based component mode synthesis method. The flexibility-based component mode synthesis method is known to provide reliable and improved performance compared to other component mode synthesis methods. However, it is not possible to estimate errors in finite element models reduced by the flexibility-based component mode synthesis method yet. In this study, an a posteriori method is developed to accurately estimate relative errors in individual eigenvalues approximated by the flexibility-based component mode synthesis method without knowing the exact eigenvalues. The excellent performance of this error estimation method is demonstrated through various numerical examples.",53,10
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053699,A new procedure for the integrated structural electromagnetic analysis of cable mesh reflectors with structural random dimensional errors is presented. The procedure combines the integrated structural electromagnetic analysis with reliability analysis and aims to investigate the effects of structural random dimensional errors on the antenna far-field directivity pattern. Both the antenna far-field directivity pattern and structural member dimensions are taken as random variables in this procedure. The computational expressions of the mean value and variance of the far-field directivity are developed by means of the random factor method and the random variable’s functional moment method. The influences of structural random dimensional errors on the randomness of radiation directivity pattern are inspected via an offset cable mesh reflector.,53,10
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053724,"This paper adopts the three-dimensional lifting surface method as a new cascade-response function to predict fan broadband interaction noise. The stator is modeled as an annular cascade, and the vanes are assumed to be zero-thickness plates with no stagger angle. The unsteady loading spectrum on the stator vanes is considered under a fully three-dimensional condition rather than calculated by the strip theories that are widely used in the existing analytical broadband fan noise models. The sound power spectrum is calculated in an annular duct using numerical integration weighted by statistical turbulence spectrum. The present theory is verified by calculating the category 4 benchmark problem of the Third Computational Aeroacoustics Workshop for the response function and by comparing the predictions of a benchmark test for the broadband formulations of the sound power spectra. Then, the predictions of the inlet and exhaust sound power spectra for the NASA source diagnostic test are presented, which both show good agreement with the experimental results. The discrepancies indicate the importance of further corrections for stagger and swirling mean flow effects in realistic predictions. In the end, the variation trend of the sound power with different vane numbers is well captured, which indicates that this effect mainly refers to the propagation of cut-on acoustic modes in an annular duct. This model has the capability for further studies on the vane swept or lean effects.",53,10
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053716,"Although there is considerable interest in using wall suction to increase boundary-layer stability, stability analyses suggest that porous walls are inherently destabilizing. We explore this contradiction by performing a spatial linear stability analysis of the asymptotic suction boundary layer using a realistic model of wall suction. The porous wall is modelled as a layer of rigid, homogeneous, isotropic, porous material of small permeability, in which inertial effects may be neglected. The porous layer is bounded above by a semi-infinite region in which a boundary layer is driven by a constant freestream velocity. The wall suction is created by applying a suction pressure to a semi-infinite region below the porous layer. Our stability analysis takes account of the full coupling between the flowfields in the boundary-layer and suction regions, governed by the Navier–Stokes equations, and the flow in the porous layer, governed by the volume-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. We find that small amounts of wall permeability destabilize the Tollmien–Schlichting wave and cause a substantial broadening of the unstable region. As a result, the stabilization of boundary layers by wall suction is substantially less effective and more expensive than what is predicted by classical boundary-layer theory.",53,10
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053771,"This study focuses on the corner flow separation occurring in a simplified wing-body junction composed of a NACA0015 twisted wing mounted on a flat plate at a Reynolds number based on the wing chord of . Wind-tunnel test measurements are carried out in the corner area including extensive oil-flow visualizations, high speed particle image velocimetry and unsteady pressure sensors. The analysis of the experimental database shows that the corner flow separation creates mean flow distortions that induce high anisotropy in the Reynolds stresses and turbulent kinetic energy. The wall pressure spectra show a broadband hump associated with the corner flow separation at , based on the incoming boundary layer thickness. A sensitivity study indicates the progressive growth of the corner flow separation with increasing angle of attack, leading to complete wing stall and the delay of the corner flow separation onset when the incoming boundary layer is thicker.",53,10
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053816,"Variations of manufacturing process parameters, environment aspects, and imperfections may significantly affect the quality and performance of stiffened shells. The reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of stiffened shells, considering all these uncertainty factors simultaneously, is extremely time-consuming, even if the surrogate-based technology is used. Therefore, a hybrid bi-stage framework for RBDO of stiffened shells is presented to release the computational burden, where two main sources of uncertainties are considered: variations of material properties and geometric dimensions are described as random variables, while various forms of imperfections of stiffened shells are covered by the single perturbation load approach. The basic idea of the proposed method is to combine the efficiency of smeared stiffener method with the accuracy of finite element method, and then narrow the design window efficiently with little accuracy sacrifice. The adaptive chaos control method is used to ensure the robustness of the search process of the most probable target point. The numerical example illustrates the advantage of the proposed method over other RBDO approaches from the point of view of computational cost, accuracy and robustness of the result.",53,10
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053817,"The flowfield characteristics of boundary-layer combustion using a multiporthole injector array were investigated in a numerical study. Hydrogen fuel was injected at four different mass flow rates and two streamwise porthole spacings within the boundary layer on a flat plate through an array of small portholes in a Mach 4.5 crossflow. The jet-to-jet spacings used were those identified in a previous investigation of film cooling as yielding the greatest drag reduction and mixing efficiency, respectively. The effect of injectant mass flow rate and streamwise jet-to-jet spacing was investigated using the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with Menter’s shear stress transport turbulence model and a 13-species, 33-reaction hydrogen–air chemistry model. At high injection mass flow rates, ignition occurred at the injection point; however, the ignition length increased as the mass flow rate was decreased. At the lowest injection rate, ignition did not occur within the investigated domain. Where combustion occurred, significant thickening of the boundary layer and high local heating was found near the ignition point. Total viscous drag reductions of up to 78% over a plate length of 0.5 m were achieved. The mechanism of drag reduction was found to be associated with a reduction in near-wall Reynolds stresses. Even with the presence of combustion in the boundary layer, significant wall heat transfer rate reductions were also found in all cases compared with no injection.",53,10
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053819,"To investigate the potential benefits of hydrogen fuel injection in a three-dimensional scramjet inlet, flow through a Mach 12 rectangular-to-elliptical shape transitioning scramjet inlet was simulated with and without hydrogen fuel injection along its body-side compression surface. The observed flowfields showed that, at an equivalence ratio of 0.33, the fuel cannot escape the body-side boundary layer, having little effect on macroscopic inlet flow structures. Interaction with the surrounding boundary-layer turbulence causes robust mixing of the fuel in the inlet. Fuel radicals are produced immediately following injection, particularly where the fuel plumes interact with thin, hot hypersonic boundary layers sweeping inward from the inlet side walls. Combustion does not proceed until the inlet compression process is nearly complete due to low static pressures in the inlet. Once the well-mixed fuel is processed by the final inlet compression shock, ignition and combustion occurs rapidly in the nearly constant cross-section region just upstream of the throat. The net drag increase observed was less than 5%. This modest increase was primarily due to the fuel-injection process, with almost no additional drag due to fuel combustion. Similar flow structures in other inlets suggest they would benefit from inlet fuel injection.",53,10
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053681,"A nonlinear extension of the multi-time-delay stochastic estimation technique is presented. The proposed approach consists of the design of nonlinear prediction filters based on artificial neural networks or, for smaller problems, on Volterra expansions of the measured wall variable. The application to two different flows is discussed. The first case is the estimation of the temporal dynamics of the velocity fluctuations in a cavity shear layer in low subsonic conditions from wall-pressure measurements. The second case is the estimation of the streamwise velocity fluctuations in the buffer layer of a fully developed turbulent channel flow from wall shear stress measurements. It is shown that the accuracy of the nonlinear technique is application dependent as it is significantly affected by the underlying nonlinear nature of the flow investigated. In particular, we show that, for the cavity shear layer case, the improvement is marginal and it does not appear to be worth the additional computational complexity associated with the nonlinear problem. On the other hand, the improvement in accuracy of the nonlinear estimation of the velocity fluctuations in the wall turbulence case is significant, owing to the strong nonlinearity of the dynamics in the wall-bounded flow.",53,10
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053843,"The influence of the nozzle geometry, namely, the nozzle-wall thickness and the nozzle length , on the vortex breakdown of compressible, swirling nozzle-jet flows is numerically investigated. The Reynolds number is set to and the Mach number is . The nozzle is either in rotation with the mean-flow direction or kept at rest. In a first set of simulations, the nozzle-wall thickness is varied in the range , whereas the nozzle length is kept constant . For the rotating nozzle wall, the flowfield changes significantly, mainly due to a variation in the initial swirl number and an enhanced centrifugal instability at the outer side of the nozzle wall. For the setup with a nozzle kept at rest, only minor changes of the flowfield are observed in general for a variation of the nozzle-wall thickness. Changing the nozzle length from to , while keeping the wall thickness constant , leads to a shift of the recirculation region downstream for both setups, and a reduction of its radial extent. The helical instabilities developing in the downstream direction within the boundary layers at the nozzle wall reach higher amplitudes for the long nozzles, leading to the observed differences in the configurations downstream of the nozzle. The results presented reemphasize the important role played by the nozzle configuration upstream of the swirling jet for the development of the vortex-breakdown configuration, and contribute to the clarification of the effects of the nozzle geometry.",53,10
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053845,"A flapping rotary wing is a novel layout for micro air vehicle design. A computational fluid dynamics method is employed to understand the unsteady aerodynamic behavior of such a layout at a low Reynolds number. A comparison of flow between an flapping wing and a typical flapping rotary wing is conducted to evaluate the effect of rotational moment. Although the mean lift of the flapping wing is close to zero, a large mean rotational moment can drive the wing to rotate. A large mean lift coefficient can be obtained when the wing begins to rotate, but the mean rotational moment coefficient starts to decrease. The leading-edge vortex is attached to the wing surface until it moves to the trailing edge, despite the negative spanwise flow near the tip. The aerodynamic force depends on nondimensional variables, including flapping amplitude, mean angle of attack, pitching amplitude, ratio of period of flapping to rotation motion , and Reynolds number. An analysis of these nondimensional variables shows that only an increase in pitching amplitude or Reynolds number increases both mean lift and rotational moment, which is an expected feature for micro air vehicle design.",53,10
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053851,"A numerical study is presented, aimed at evaluating the capability of vortex generators to produce a significant delay of separation and drag reduction in flows past smooth bluff bodies in the transcritical flow regime, with turbulent boundary layers ahead of separation. A fairly large series of steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations is carried out of the incompressible flow past a circular cylinder, with a simple and generic geometry, with and without vortex generators. Their effect is emulated with a body force, applied in a refined-grid region, instead of gridding the actual geometry. The flow is treated as steady, for reasons that are discussed. The parametric study includes 10 different vortex generator designs, as well as varying positions, spacings, and heights. Drag reductions of up to 60% are obtained, including those with sub-boundary-layer designs, with a height equal to half the boundary-layer thickness. Design recommendations are given, with the tolerance to vortex shedding and other variations in the flow conditions taken into account.",53,10
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053842,"A tunable diode laser-based absorption diagnostic has been developed to characterize transient phenomena within the Stanford Expansion Tube Flow Facility. A measurement rate of 25 kHz was achieved to identify and investigate transient flow structures within the facility test time. Key parameters provided by the diagnostic include the temperature, mole fraction, and velocity time histories of the supersonic test gas, as well as the structure and timing of the test gas contact surfaces. The presence of water within the test gas affords well-established rovibrational transitions near that are probed using calibration-free, scanned wavelength-modulation absorption spectroscopy with second harmonic detection. This technique offers the sensitivity and noise resistance necessary for in situ temperature, velocity, and mole fraction measurements within the harsh conditions of the expansion tube. A rigorous scanned wavelength-modulation absorption spectroscopy with second harmonic detection theory has been employed to account for nonideal laser performance associated with high-bandwidth tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy measurements. The measurements carried out with this sensor provide a quantitative characterization of the test gas conditions produced in the expansion tube and thus lay an essential foundation for supersonic combustion experimentation within the facility.",53,10
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053804,"A novel method involving the use of micromechanical analysis to predict elastic constants of a unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite is proposed. The method revolves around a model called the two-parameter model. The two parameters are obtained by performing one micromechanical analysis of the composite unit cell along one of its transverse directions. The method involves construction of response surfaces that act as surrogate models, for the prediction of the two parameters, corresponding to any fiber-reinforced composite design that uses a transversely isotropic fiber and an isotropic matrix. Using the two parameters, four of the five elastic constants can be computed. The fifth elastic constant, longitudinal shear modulus, is predicted using a separate response surface. The results indicate that the two-parameter model in conjunction with the response surface makes accurate prediction of composite elastic constants.",53,10
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053863,"Experiments were performed on flexible and rigid rectangular aspect ratio 2 wings undergoing pure rotational motion. Chordwise wing flexibility was modeled by a 1 degree-of-freedom linkage of rigid panels, free to pivot about the midchord. For each wing, unsteady force measurements were acquired for three-quarter-span Reynolds numbers of 10,000, 15,000, and 25,000 and leading-edge angles of attack from 0 to 70 deg. Dye flow visualization was used to establish flow structure similarity over the Reynolds number range. Thin-airfoil theory for finite, low-aspect-ratio wings was compared to the experimental lift measurements. Results show that the lift generated by the flexible wing rotating in a quiescent flow increased with instantaneous geometric angle of attack and wing camber, even at angles of incidence above static stall. Passive deformation of the posterior wing section played an important role in lift generation during wake encounters by increasing the camber of the wing and geometric angle of attack, thus mitigating the loss in lift in the presence of downwash.",53,10
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053736,"The extended high-order sandwich panel theory was formulated in its one-dimensional version for orthotropic elastic sandwich beams. This theory includes the in-plane rigidity of the core, and the compressibility of the soft core in the transverse direction is also considered. The novelty of this theory is that it allows for three generalized coordinates in the core (the axial and transverse displacements at the centroid of the core, and the rotation at the centroid of the core) instead of just one (midpoint transverse displacement) commonly adopted in other available theories. The theory was derived so that all core/face displacement continuity conditions are fulfilled. It is proven, by comparison to the elasticity solution, that this approach results in superior accuracy, especially for the cases of stiffer cores, for which cases of the other available sandwich computational models cannot correctly predict the stress fields involved. In this paper, a linear finite element is formulated based on the extended high-order sandwich panel theory. The element equations are outlined, and numerical results for the simply supported case of transverse distributed loading are produced for several typical sandwich configurations. These results are compared with the corresponding ones from the elasticity solution. The comparison among these numerical results shows that, with a relatively small number of elements, the results are very close to the elasticity ones in terms of both the displacements and stress or strains. Thus, the finite element version of the extended high-order sandwich panel theory constitutes a very powerful analytical tool for sandwich panels.",53,10
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053865,"A wall-distance-free modification to the Spalart–Allmaras one-equation turbulence model is proposed and evaluated. The and that render the hybrid timescale are determined using the transport equation together with the Bradshaw and other empirical relations. The model coefficients and other empirical functions are constructed to preserve some anisotropic characteristics of turbulence for application to nonequilibrium turbulent flows. The modified Spalart–Allmaras model is applied to calculate a few well-documented flows, yielding predictions in good agreement with the direct numerical simulation and experimental data. Comparisons demonstrate that the modified SA model offers some improvement over the original Spalart–Allmaras model and is competitive with the shear-stress transport model.",53,10
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053872,"This study examines time-marching procedures for fluid–thermal–structural analysis using time-accurate thermal and structural solvers combined with quasi-steady aerothermodynamic models. Four coupling schemes are considered, including a conventional scheme with explicit time integration, a basic loose coupling scheme with implicit time integration, a predictor-based implicit scheme, and a subiteration-based implicit scheme with strong coupling. The first three schemes also incorporate structural subcycling, in which the structural time step is smaller than the thermal time step. Convergence studies reveal that the conventional explicit and basic implicit schemes are first-order accurate in time, whereas the predictor implicit and strong implicit schemes retain second-order accuracy. Structural subcycling is found to preserve the order of accuracy for the predictor implicit scheme. Additional analysis of the long-term behavior of the solution of two configurations indicates that the conventional explicit and basic implicit schemes can predict spurious behavior at larger time steps compared to the predictor implicit and strong implicit schemes. Finally, the predictor implicit scheme is found to provide significant computational savings for both a dynamically stable response and a dynamically unstable limit-cycle response compared to the other schemes.",53,10
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053884,"The aerodynamic performance of flapping micro air vehicles in hover conditions is dependent on many parameters, including the wing design. With the goal of optimizing the wing for hover performance, the initial focus was to reduce the uncertainty in the thrust measurements. This is because lower uncertainty in this metric enables better resolution in comparing the performance of different designs. Aerodynamic performance variability was deemed to be the fault of an imprecise manufacturing technique. Therefore, adjustments were made to the fabrication process until a permissible level of uncertainty was attained for optimization; the goal was less than 5%. This paper chronicles the progression of the wing fabrication process and details how the uncertainty was evaluated. Four fabrication methods and two different wing designs are included in this study: a carbon fiber hand layup technique, carbon fiber cured in a machined mold, and two variations of a machined plastic skeleton reinforced with a carbon fiber rod. The uncertainty in thrust production, expressed in coefficient of variation, improved from 16.8% for the hand layup method to 2.6% for the computer numerically controlled plastic skeleton adhered to the nylon membrane with transfer tape. Additionally, the coefficient of variation for wing weight also reduced (from 11.4 to 2.0%).",53,10
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053888,"This paper presents a time-domain Fourier method for modeling steady and unsteady nonaxisymmetric flows in turbomachinery on a reduced computational domain. The method extends well-established single-passage multirow methods, which efficiently model periodic unsteadiness in single stages, to assemblies with stationary circumferential perturbations with periodicity different from the blade count. Such perturbations are caused, for example, by rotor–rotor/stator–stator interaction or geometric circumferential variations. The method is therefore suitable to study low-engine-order forcing problems, flow past nonuniform assemblies, and clocking problems. The proposed method solves the flow inside several discrete passages, located at different circumferential positions, using a time-accurate scheme. Boundary conditions at the azimuthal and interrow surfaces are approximated via time–space Fourier series and couple the individual passages. The reduced passage model is validated against the whole annulus solution for three test cases: 1) a row of outlet guide vanes with stagger pattern, 2) a high-pressure turbine stage with throat area variation in the stator, and 3) a 1.5-stage compressor. It is demonstrated that the time-domain Fourier method yields results equivalent to the whole annulus model but at a much reduced computational cost.",53,10
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053887,"A new laminar–turbulence transition model for capturing three-dimensional boundary layers involving crossflow-induced transition has been developed by extending the existing transition model. In the present transition model, to resolve transition due to crossflow instability, the C1-criterion was evaluated locally using the Falkner–Skan–Cooke velocity profiles. Thus, only local flow quantities are used in determining the onset of three-dimensional transition. As a result, the extended transition model is compatible and works well with modern computational fluid dyanmics flow solvers, particularly for those based on unstructured meshes, under massive parallel environment. The new transition model was implemented in a three-dimensional incompressible unstructured mesh flow solver. Validations of the new transition model were made for an infinite swept-wing configuration and an inclined prolate spheroid by comparing the results with those of the baseline model and experiment. It was found that the new transition model works well by capturing the crossflow-induced transition inside three-dimensional boundary layers more accurately than the baseline model.",53,10
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053893,"This paper presents a data-driven approach for the online updating of the flight envelope of an unmanned aerial vehicle subjected to structural degradation. The main contribution of the work is a general methodology that leverages both physics-based modeling and data to decompose tasks into two phases: expensive offline simulations to build an efficient characterization of the problem and rapid data-driven classification to support online decision making. In the approach, physics-based models at the wing and vehicle level run offline to generate libraries of information covering a range of damage scenarios. These libraries are queried online to estimate vehicle capability states. The state estimation and associated quantification of uncertainty are achieved by Bayesian classification using sensed strain data. The methodology is demonstrated on a conceptual unmanned aerial vehicle executing a pullup maneuver, in which the vehicle flight envelope is updated dynamically with onboard sensor information. During vehicle operation, the maximum maneuvering load factor is estimated using structural strain sensor measurements combined with physics-based information from precomputed damage scenarios that consider structural weakness. Compared to a baseline case that uses a static as-designed flight envelope, the self-aware vehicle achieves both an increase in probability of executing a successful maneuver and an increase in overall usage of the vehicle capability.",53,10
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053907,"A novel technique is presented, which combines the fields of coherence-based noise-source identification with acoustic modal analysis. Coherence-based noise-source-identification techniques apply the coherence function, estimated between pairs of dynamic pressure sensors, to identify the relative contributions of one or several noise sources to the total noise measured at a location of interest. Acoustic-modal-analysis techniques use arrays of microphones to decompose the pressure field at an axial location of a duct into constituent modal amplitudes. Conditional Spectral Analysis: Modal is the primary novel technique presented herein, and uses conditional spectral analysis to allow the beneficial capabilities of each of these well-regarded fields to be combined into one method. The technique allows the total modal pressure field measured in a duct to be decomposed into parts associated with contributing uncorrelated noise sources. The techniques’ efficacy is validated with a two noise-source-region experimental rig. A second novel technique is also presented: Signal Enhancement: Modal, which is in essence a modal version and enhancement of the now classic signal-enhancement technique, which allows the influence of extraneous noise to be removed from acoustic modal measurements. The modal signal enhancement was developed as part of the modal conditional spectral analysis, but can in fact be used independently in conditions in which only one correlated noise source is measured by the sensors in the duct. The modal-conditional-spectral-analysis technique represents a significant advancement in noise-source identification, and may be applied to a full-scale aeroengine to identify the specific contributions of core-noise sources within the engine to the amplitudes of the acoustic modes propagating through the engine exhaust. This added acoustic modal information can be used to predict the relative contribution of these noise sources to the total noise radiated from the engine and into the far field. Knowledge of the contributions of each core-noise-source contribution to the modal content propagating through the engine exhaust also allows for better mitigation through optimized liner designs and location.",53,10
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053913,"A viscous numerical simulation was performed to study the forebody shock reflection at the cowl under the condition of inflow Mach number higher than the design value for different forebody/cowl configurations. With the help of shock reflection theory and numerical simulation, it was found that the shock reflection changed from overall regular reflection wave configuration to overall Mach reflection wave configuration as the cowl angle decreased or the ramp angle increased. Mach reflection in this situation would be harmful; it could result in the shock propagating forward to cause a shock detachment at the cowl lip (the so-called local unstart of inlet in this paper). And the local unstart of inlet essentially resulted from the transition of forebody shock reflection from overall regular reflection to overall Mach reflection at the cowl. It was also found through comparison with inviscid analysis that the viscous effect had to be considered in the local unstart of inlet for practical applications. The obtained results would be useful for the design of hypersonic forebody/cowl configurations.",53,10
