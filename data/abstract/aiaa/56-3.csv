Although these workers determined the overall loads (circulation, lift, and moment), they did not explicitly derive the vortex sheet strength (which is used to compute these loads). Simply put, vortex sheet strength is the velocity difference above/below the airfoil, so it is related to the pressure distribution and therefore the loads. Knowledge of the vortex sheet strength is important because, to extend this seminal theory to include nonlinearities such as thickness–load coupling, viscous–load coupling, or boundary-layer separation, one needs to inform these calculations with the vortex sheet strength. The main contribution of this paper is a method to theoretically predict the vortex sheet strength in the seminal unsteady aerodynamics problems of Sears, Küssner, Theodorsen, and Wagner. These theoretical calculations are enabled by developing a numerical method for calculating the required Fourier coefficients. In addition, a unified presentation of linear unsteady aerodynamics theory is contributed, and examples are provided to illustrate the vortex sheet strength in each of the four seminal problems.",56,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056068,"The present paper proposes a continuous-time state-space formulation of the unsteady vortex lattice method, which is derived through a discretization of the governing advection equation for transport of vorticity in the wake. A continuous-time system is obtained by only discretizing the advection equation in space, while retaining the derivative with respect to time. The discretization in space is based on the discontinuous Galerkin method. The present method can be applied to any arbitrary nonuniform wake discretization and can be extended to higher-order panel methods or a nonflat wake shape. The method is extended to compressible flows by applying the Prandtl–Glauert transformation. The time-dependent terms in the small disturbance potential equation are neglected. Thus, incompressible flow solution procedures are applied with minimum modifications to unsteady compressible problems. The benefits are demonstrated by applying the model to the gust analysis of a general aircraft wing, varying the time step, and introducing a nonuniform wake discretization, resulting in a reduced model size for a given accuracy. The resulting continuous-time state-space model can be used for efficient loads analysis of general aircraft wings including the effects of compressibility and allows for easy integration with structural or flight dynamic models for efficient aero(servo)elastic analyses.",56,3

High-quality simultaneous flowfield and surface-deflection data were obtained in this high-Reynolds-number flow using nonintrusive, full-field, optical diagnostics (planar particle image velocimetry and stereo/three-dimensional digital image correlation, respectively). Both experimental setups were rigorously validated in terms of their measurement resolution and accuracy, both individually and in a combined manner. The full-field surface deflection data indicate that the surface has a predominantly quasi-static response characterized by a “standing-wave” type contour along the jet axis. A large jetward deflection, on the order of 10 plate thicknesses, was observed near the first shock-cell region, which is consistent with previously obtained rigid-surface case surface pressure measurements. The compliant-surface flowfield was analyzed and compared to the rigid-surface case results in key regions: the initial expansion region, through the shock/boundary-layer interaction, the shock/boundary-layer interaction separation region, the shock-cell structure of the remainder of the jet plume, the near-wall boundary layer, and the far-field conditions. Notable differences were observed before, within, and after the shock/boundary-layer interaction region as well as within the boundary layer and in the shock-cell structure.",56,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056159,"This paper presents diagnostic experiments aimed at understanding and mitigating supersonic jet noise from the coherent wave-packet structures that are the source of peak aft-angle mixing noise. Both isothermal and heated, nearly perfectly expanded, Mach 1.5 jets were forced in the near-nozzle region with air injection generated by a spinning-valve device designed to excite the jet at frequencies approaching those of the dominant turbulent structures. Substantial reductions in the peak aft-angle radiation were achieved with steady blowing at amplitudes corresponding to 2–6% of the mass flow rate of the primary jet. The noise benefit saturated at mass flow rates above 4%, with as much as a 6 dB reduction in overall sound pressure level at aft angles. Increasing the mass flow rates yielded a monotonically increasing high-frequency noise penalty at the sideline, where noise levels in the natural jet were already 15 dB lower than the aft-angle peak, so that the penalty due to actuation was minor. Although both steady and periodic unsteady mass injections were produced by the spinning valve when it rotated, it was calibrated to hold the steady mass flow rate constant as the frequency of unsteady blowing was changed. In this way, the effect of steady and unsteady blowings on the acoustic field could be decoupled. It is shown that the noise benefit was uniquely associated with the steady component of blowing, whereas the unsteady component resulted in additive tones in the spectra. This implied linearity is consistent with theory and experiments showing that the wave-packet structures, which give rise to the dominant aft-angle radiation, evolve in the turbulent mean flowfield in a nearly linear fashion from their origin in the near-nozzle region. The interpretation of noise reduction is that the steady component of blowing spreads the mean flow more rapidly, resulting in weaker wave packets. Periodic unsteady blowing forces coherent wave packets that are largely uncorrelated from the random natural ones, which then leads to the observed additive tones.",56,3

(“Measurements of Unsteady Pressure Fluctuations in the Near-Field of a Solid Rocket Motor Plume,” International Journal of Aeroacoustics,Vol. 15, Nos. 4–5, July 2016, pp. 554–569) presented extensive measurements of the acoustic near field of a solid-propellant rocket. The experiment consists of two phases: the high-burn phase and the low-burn phase. The main objective of this investigation is to use this set of data for the determination of the dominant noise components in the near field of a rocket. The data consist of spectral measurements of an array of 14 near-field microphones and a single far-field microphone. By itself, this set of data is insufficient to accomplish the stated objective. The data are supplemented with information provided by the two-noise source model (Tam, C. K. W., Viswanathen, K., Ahuja, K. K., and Panda, J., “The Sources of Jet Noise: Experimental Evidence,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 615, 2008, pp. 253–292) of hot supersonic laboratory jets. The two-noise source model is supported by the existence of two similarity spectra. By applying the similarity spectra to the data of Horne et al. at low burn, it is shown that the dominant noise components in the near field of a solid-propellant rocket are the same as those found in the far field of supersonic jets. Further, the data allow the development of a model for the spatial distribution of the sources of the dominant noise components. On applying the model to the high-burn phase of the experiment, excellent agreements are found.",56,3

The experimental data refer to aeroacoustic and aerodynamic measurements in a closed-section wind tunnel for a wide range of angles of attack (from up to the stall; approximately at 18 deg) and Mach numbers between 0.07 and 0.1. Three slat configurations (the original MD30P30N, another with a higher slat deflection, and one with smaller slat gap and overlap) are studied experimentally. The signal processing applied to the acoustic data involves conventional beamforming enhanced by two deconvolution algorithms, namely, DAMAS and CLEAN-SC. An original variation of the beamforming cluster approach that is based on the coherence level among microphone pairs is introduced, and it improves the results obtained by DAMAS. Below and above 12 deg angles of attack, the slat noise is very small and mostly below the wind-tunnel background noise for all configurations. Between and 12 deg angles of attack, the slat noise spectra are substantially affected by the slat configuration, although it always contains a dominant low-frequency content, a midfrequency broadband noise, and a single high-frequency broad peak. Within this range, the lower angles of attack display the strongest low-frequency narrowband peaks. In fact, at lower angles of attack, the low-frequency narrowband peaks scale with a Mach power above 10.",56,3

The study includes both experiments, which are aimed primarily at supplying data for a validation of simulation approaches and numerical simulations based on a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation approach. An acoustic modal decomposition of the measured and computed unsteady pressure fields is then carried out, which allows extracting “pure” (with filtered out hydrodynamic/turbulent fluctuations) acoustic modes propagating upstream and downstream under reflection-free conditions. A comparison with the experiment is performed for both the “raw” pressure spectra on the duct walls and the extracted individual acoustic modes. It is shown that, in terms of acoustics, a replacement of the clean inlet by the rectangular/circular one is almost neutral, whereas the T-junction inlet causes a strong noise penalty.",56,3

Passing through the range of transonic Mach numbers to supersonic cruise speed should be sufficiently fast to avoid significant fatigue damage. In this study, the sequence of bifurcations of limit cycles when the flow speed is continuously increasing or decreasing is analyzed. The evolution of limit-cycle oscillations is carefully studied. It is shown that the most dangerous oscillation regimes, high-frequency periodic or nonperiodic oscillations, are suppressed if the flow acceleration is sufficiently fast. However, first-mode limit cycle and limit cycle involving internal 1:2 resonance are not affected by the flow acceleration, such that lower accumulation of the fatigue damage in fast accelerating flow is possible only because of fewer cycles of oscillations, but not because of the decrease of the limit-cycle amplitude.",56,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056514,"A new parametric flutter margin method for linear and nonlinear stability analysis of aeroservoelastic systems is presented. The method is based on frequency-response calculations with the system stabilized using a single selected structural, aerodynamic, or control parameter, which facilitates convenient response calculations with smooth response variations with respect to the excitation frequency and flight conditions. The frequency-response functions are used for generating flutter margins with respect to the added parameter. The linear flutter or nonlinear limit-cycle oscillation characteristics are those at which the margins become zero. Furthermore, the method facilitates convenient and efficient design studies with respect to linear and nonlinear variations of the selected parameter. A frequency-domain response analysis is first performed with the linear part of the model. Increased-order modeling concepts may then be applied to add nonlinear effects using time-domain convolution or harmonic-balance methods. Three numerical applications are given, one with a classic wing section with flap and two with a generic transport aircraft model. The examples include bending-torsion and control-surface flutter cases, with and without control-system and actuator free-play effects. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with those obtained using traditional flutter methods and nonlinear time-marching simulations.",56,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056302,"This paper examines the steady interaction of a shear layer separating two uniform supersonic streams of Mach numbers and with an oblique shock approaching from the faster stream at an incident angle sufficiently small for the postshock flow to remain supersonic everywhere. The development begins by considering the related problem of oblique-shock impingement on a supersonic vortex sheet of infinitesimal thickness, for which the region of existence of regular shock refractions with downstream supersonic flow is delineated in the parametric space . The interaction region located about the impingement point, scaling with the shear-layer thickness, is described next by integrating the Euler equations in the postshock region, formulated in characteristic form, subject to the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions at the shock front. The results are used to investigate the accuracy and limitations of a simplified treatment, the so-called Moeckel–Chisnell approach, commonly employed for determining the shape of the shock wave in these scenarios, which does not account for the influence of the postshock flow. It is found that, although the Moeckel–Chisnell method predicts accurately the shape of the shock front as it evolves across the shear layer, it is unable to predict the final transition to the transmitted-shock solution, which occurs beyond the edge of the shear layer. The structure of the shear layer in the far field also is addressed here for the first time, with the objective being to lay the groundwork for future studies of shock-induced ignition in supersonic fuel–air mixing layers.",56,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055572,"The three-dimensional interactions of the near-field structures in a developing two-stream exhaust by a three-stream engine are documented. This paper analyzes six planes of near-field pressure generated by large-eddy simulation. After a basic documentation of the spectral analysis, several hot-spots that participate in the dynamics of the complex flow are identified. Cross-correlations between the hot-spots and the entire pressure fields reveal the interactions and propagations of near-field structures, which include shocks, vortex structures, and acoustic radiation. The near-field interactions are also studied in specific frequency bands, which enable us to map out their communication pathways. By applying phase-averaging to the pressure fluctuations, strong phase relationships in the developing jet are identified and the information propagation is confirmed by proper orthogonal decomposition. Some pressure signals outside the jet core are found as good reference for the phase of pressure fields and they are experimentally accessible as possible Kulite sensors. The different techniques applied show consistent results and confirm the identified regions and frequencies that play a key role in the near-field dynamics.",56,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056442,"Direct numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the physical structures of a transverse sonic air jet injected into a supersonic air crossflow at a Mach number of 2.7. Simulations were run for two different jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratios of 1.85 and 5.5. The main averaged flow features around the transverse jet, such as major counter-rotating vortices and trailing counter-rotating vortices, were captured. The major counter-rotating vortices formed in the lateral portion of the jet plume and absorbed other induced trailing vortices downstream of the jet plume. Upper trailing counter-rotating vortices formed above the major counter-rotating vortices downstream of the jet barrel shock. The streamline analysis indicated that the upper trailing counter-rotating vortices were related to the Mach disk. As the streamlines penetrated the lateral side of Mach disk where a strong shear condition existed, the baroclinic torque induced upper vorticities in the opposite rotating direction against the major counter-rotating vortices. Downstream of the Mach disk, the baroclinic vorticity production along the streamlines tended to approach zero, which means no more torque was pumped into the far field and the upper trailing counter-rotating vortices were merged into the major counter-rotating vortices by their suction.",56,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056084,"Argon gas is demonstrated to enhance femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging at atmospheric pressure and temperature for unseeded velocimetry applications, primarily through two to four orders of magnitude increase of excited species that may radiate through nitrogen’s second positive system at early timescales of interest. The first positive system continues to play an important role in maintaining this emission at longer delays. A detailed kinetic model is implemented to explain this observed behavior in nitrogen and argon mixtures. Dominant processes governing the creation of and include a slower decay of electron temperature through increased ionization processes, reduced nitrogen quenching of electrons, nitrogen atom creation and recombination, the formation and dissociation of , and a number of argon–nitrogen direct and indirect excitation pathways. The production of ions through charge-transfer reactions and affect excited C- and B-state nitrogen population delays at later times . The pooling reactions play minor roles in the formation of and at timescales useful for measurements in the femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging argon plasma chemistry. In mixtures where nitrogen is dominant, metastable argon species are less instrumental in direct nitrogen excitation transfer, , than in facilitating further reactions through maintaining a higher electron temperature, whereas this excitation transfer begins to play a larger role as the percentage of argon is further increased. The model yields results that agree with sub-100 torr argon–nitrogen discharge experiments and theoretical results derived from other studies. It is concluded that not one single process can be credited for the enhancement, but a combination of ionization and heating produces the increased emission observed in argon mixtures.",56,3

Therefore, the flowfield of arc-heated facility L3K, which has been intensively used for ablation material tests in Europe, has been characterized using advanced diagnostic tools. For the first time, the complete flow chain from the reservoir to the freestream and shock layer has been studied using sophisticated measurement techniques. Rotational and vibrational temperatures of nitrogen molecules were measured in the reservoir, freestream, and shock layer using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. In addition, the temperatures of nitric oxide molecules in the freestream were measured by means of laser-induced fluorescence. Emission spectroscopy provided quantitative data of shock-layer temperatures. For the measurement of the freestream velocity and electron density, a microwave interferometer has been used. In addition, the pitot pressure and cold wall heat flux rate have been measured by means of intrusive probes. Parallel to the experimental investigation, numerical rebuilding of the flowfield has been conducted by using the TAU code developed at German Aerospace Center (DLR). The results of the multitemperature model provide further insight into the flow physics of the facility.",56,3

Specifically, retrospective cost adaptive control is pursued. Retrospective cost adaptive control is a direct discrete-time adaptive control algorithm that is applicable to stabilization, command following, and disturbance rejection. Retrospective cost adaptive control uses minimal modeling information, past control inputs, and limited measurements to retrospectively optimize the controller coefficients. A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model of the Hyshot-II scramjet geometry is used with a heat-release model to represent the dynamics of the combustor. This representation involves coupled nonlinear partial differential equations with degrees of freedom. First, the open-loop dynamic response of the model is studied to estimate essential features of the system. Then, retrospective cost adaptive control is used to maintain the commanded thrust in the presence of a disturbance in the Mach number. Finally, a modified performance variable is defined and is shown to enable retrospective cost adaptive control to suppress unstart.",56,3

The experimental study was performed in an icing research tunnel available at Iowa State University. A NACA 0012 airfoil/wing model embedded with dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuators was installed in the icing research tunnel under typical glaze-/rime-icing conditions pertinent to aircraft inflight icing phenomena. While a high-speed imaging system was used to record the dynamic ice-accretion process over the airfoil surface for the test cases with and without plasma generation, an infrared thermal imaging system was used to map the corresponding temperature distributions to quantify the unsteady heat transfer and phase changing process over the airfoil surface. For the typical glaze-ice condition, the thermal effect induced by dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma generation was demonstrated to be able to prevent ice accretion over the airfoil surface during the entire ice-accretion experiment. The measured quantitative surface temperature distributions were correlated with the acquired images of the dynamic ice-accretion and water runback processes to elucidate the underlying physics.",56,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056138,"Electroaerodynamic thrust has been proposed as a means for aircraft propulsion, potentially enabling near-silent and solid-state flight. Studies to date have experimentally quantified electroaerodynamic thrust density and thrust-to-power performance, determining that electroaerodynamic propulsion may be viable for use on fixed-wing aircraft. These studies, however, have only assessed electroaerodynamic propulsion devices at ground-level atmospheric pressure and in a static laboratory frame with zero flight velocity. This analysis is the first to analytically quantify the performance of a simplified one-dimensional electroaerodynamic propulsion system as a function of altitude and flight velocity. It is found that the thrust to power of a geometrically fixed thruster will decrease with altitude due to the decrease in pressure. Between 0 and 25 km, this decrease is predicted to be . This loss in thrust-to-power performance, however, can be offset by geometrically scaling the size of the thruster with altitude at the cost of decreased thrust density. The thrust to power is also expected to decrease with increasing forward velocity of an electroaerodynamically propelled aircraft due to an increase in the effective mobility of ions generated by the propulsion system. Neglecting losses due to drag, however, yields an increase in overall efficiency with increasing flight speed. When compared to an ideal propeller and high-bypass-ratio turbofan, the electroaerodynamic thruster performance shows comparable thrust-to-power dependence on altitude and flight speed.",56,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055838,"In principle, the impedance of a locally reacting acoustic liner should be independent of the structure of the sound field above the liner. Some experimental studies, however, have found that the impedance inversely determined by available eduction techniques is actually dependent on the direction of incident waves relative to the mean flow. This dependence has mainly been attributed to the incomplete description of flow physics in the eduction techniques, particularly to the neglect of the viscous effects. The purpose of the paper is to examine whether such a wave-direction dependence can be removed by including the flow physics that is absent in previous eduction techniques. To this end, two eduction methods using the full linearized Navier–Stokes equations are proposed. Possible turbulent effects are considered by using available turbulence models. The proposed eduction methods are applied to new measurement data and data available in the literature, and are compared with another eduction method that has been commonly used in the community. The results show that including viscous effects does not resolve the controversy on the apparent wave-direction dependence.",56,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055773,"A modified two-step method for aerodynamic shape optimization is proposed, where proper orthogonal decomposition and automatic domain-decomposition techniques are adopted to accelerate flow and adjoint solutions in the second-step optimization. As the first step in this method, the initial optimization is first performed by a genetic algorithm coupled with a kriging model. Next, a reduced-order model is set up via proper orthogonal decomposition with the reuse of ready-made flow snapshots in the first-step optimization. A proper-orthogonal-decomposition Petrov-Galerkin method is investigated to provide fast flow predictions in the second-step optimization. With the assistance of an error estimation method and an automatic domain-decomposition method that are presented in this paper, the sensitive domain in the computational grid is split out. To improve the accuracy, predictions provided by proper orthogonal decomposition in the sensitive domain are further corrected by computational fluid dynamics modifications. Meanwhile, in order to accelerate gradient solutions, the adjoint equation of this proper orthogonal decomposition and domain-decomposition-based flow analysis method is derived and discussed. The optimization results of a two-dimensional airfoil design test and a three-dimensional wing design test highlight the efficiency of the proposed method when compared with results of either a gradient-free optimization method or a traditional two-step method.",56,3

A representative aeroservoelastic system is considered, consisting of a two-dimensional potential flow over a deforming aerofoil, an actively controlled, but saturated compliant trailing edge, a dynamic observer that uses a series of pressure sensors on the aerofoil, and a heave/pitch linear spring model. Although computationally simple, the design allows for optimization over multiple disciplines: The structure can be designed by varying the stiffness of the springs, the control architecture through weightings in a linear quadratic regulator controller, the observer by means of the placement of pressure sensors, and the aerodynamics via the shaping of the compliant trailing edge. Optimizing the weight and a metric of performance over all disciplines simultaneously is compared with a sequential methodology of optimizing the open-loop characteristics first and subsequently adding a closed-loop controller. This paper shows that varying the parameterization and number of design variables during the optimization can lead to improvements in the final design and presents a procedure to automate this process. To accomplish this, a new basis for the design vector is created via proper orthogonal decomposition, using the trajectories of initial optimization paths as a training set. This parameterization is shown to make the optimization more robust with respect to the initial design and to facilitate an automated variable selection methodology. This variable selection allows for the dimension of the problem to be reduced temporarily, and it is shown that this makes the optimization more robust.",56,3

Uncertainties are being incorporated in increasingly large numbers to ensure reliability and robustness.

In this study, a constrained density-matching optimization methodology is established to address these pressing issues in chance-constrained optimization. The methodology employs an alternative objective metric between a designer-given target and system response, enables more uncertainties in design variables and random parameters to be handled, and accommodates multiple chance constraints with an adaptive penalty function. An active subspace identification strategy and a dynamic response surface are given to overcome the curse of uncertainty dimensionality and to guarantee sufficient samples for kernel density estimation in an uncertainty analysis. The efficacy is demonstrated on three optimization examples: a response function problem, a standard NASA test, and a practical application in the conceptual design of a satellite system. Different quadrature points, penalty functions, and target forms are discussed, respectively. The methodology exhibits high accuracy and strong adaptability at considerably reduced computational cost, thus providing a potential template for tackling a wide variety of chance-constrained optimization problems.",56,3

22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056026,"Uncertainty quantification is a notion that has received much interest over the past decade. It involves the extraction of statistical information from a problem with inherent variability. This variability may stem from a lack of knowledge or through observational uncertainty. Traditionally, uncertainty quantification has been a challenging pursuit owing to the lack of efficient methods available. The archetypal uncertainty quantification method is Monte Carlo theory, however, this method possesses a slow convergence rate and is therefore a computational burden in some scenarios. In contrast to Monte Carlo theory, polynomial chaos theory is an alternative approach that offers the ability to estimate statistical moments efficiently. Because polynomial chaos theory behaves like a surrogate model, it is possible to query this inexpensively for information, which allows it to be useful for Bayesian inferencing. This paper builds upon previous work, because a polynomial chaos model is demonstrated to not only be useful for uncertainty quantification applications by finding inexpensive point estimates for statistical moments, but is also able to form a component of the Bayesian likelihood function. It is thus the aim of this paper to demonstrate and combine the aforementioned notions of uncertainty quantification and Bayesian inferencing on an in-house physical T-tail structure, which is reflective of a realistic scenario. The vibrational modes of the T-tail structure will provide a basis on which the results of the uncertainty quantification analysis may be compared and on which a subsequent Bayesian inferencing procedure may be carried out to infer the correct dimensions, based on comparing the model predictions with real-life vibrational data.",56,3
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056314,"A feasible, nonparametric, probabilistic approach for modeling and quantifying model-form uncertainties associated with a computational model designed for the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem is presented. It is based on the construction of a stochastic, projection-based reduced-order model associated with a high-dimensional model using three innovative ideas: 1) the substitution of the deterministic reduced-order basis with a stochastic counterpart featuring a reduced number of hyperparameters, 2) the construction of this stochastic reduced-order basis on a subset of a compact Stiefel manifold to guarantee the linear independence of its column vectors and the satisfaction of any constraints of interest, and 3) the formulation and solution of a reduced-order inverse statistical problem to determine the hyperparameters so that the mean value and statistical fluctuations of the eigenvalues predicted using the stochastic, projection-based reduced-order model match target values obtained from available data. Consequently, the proposed approach for modeling model-form uncertainties can be interpreted as an effective approach for extracting from data fundamental information and/or knowledge that are not captured by a deterministic computational model, and incorporating them in this model. Its potential for quantifying model-form uncertainties in generalized eigencomputations is demonstrated for a natural vibration analysis of a small-scale replica of an X-56-type aircraft made of a composite material for which ground-vibration-test data are available.",56,3
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055947,"Tail modeling is an efficient method used in reliability estimation of highly safe structures. Classical tail modeling is based on performing limit-state function evaluations through a sampling scheme, selecting a threshold value to specify the tail part of the cumulative distribution function, fitting a proper model to the tail part, and estimating the reliability. In this approach, limit-state function calculations that do not belong to the tail part are mostly discarded, and so majority of limit-state evaluations are wasted. In this paper, Markov chain Monte Carlo method with Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is used to draw samples from the tail part only so that a more accurate reliability index prediction is achieved. A commonly used proposal distribution formula is modified by using a scale parameter. The optimal value of this scale parameter is obtained for various numerical example problems with a varying number of random variables, and an approximate relationship is obtained between the optimal value of the scale parameter and the number of random variables. The approximate relationship is tested on the reliability prediction of a horizontal axis wind turbine and observed to work well. It is also found that the proposed approach is more accurate than the classical tail modeling when the number of variables is less than or equal to four. For a larger number of random variables, none of the two approaches are found to be superior to another.",56,3

These components can operate safely only within a certain range of frequencies, and frequencies outside that range can lead to instability because of resonance. This paper addresses optimization of the microstructure design to maximize the yield stress of a galfenol beam under vibration tuning constraints defined for the first torsional and bending natural frequencies by using a data-driven solution scheme. In this study, two carefully designed algorithms are used to sample the entire microstructure space. Classical optimization techniques often lead to a unique microstructural solution rather than yielding the complete space of optimal microstructures. Multiple optimal solutions are imperative for the practicality of design because conventional low-cost manufacturing processes can generate only a limited set of microstructures. The current data sampling-based methodology outperforms or is on par with other optimization techniques but also provides numerous near-optimal solutions, which is two to three orders of magnitude more than previous methods. Consequently, the proposed framework delivers a spectrum of optimal solutions in the microstructure space that can accelerate material development and reduce manufacturing costs.",56,3
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056163,"An efficient and robust solution algorithm for the aerostructural analysis and coupled adjoint problems is crucial to the success of high-fidelity aerostructural optimization. The objective of the present paper is to investigate ways to maximize the efficiency of a monolithic solution method and further quantify its benefits in the context of aerostructural optimization. A Newton–Krylov method is used for the aerostructural analysis, and a preconditioned Krylov subspace method is used for the coupled adjoint solution. Several aspects of the monolithic solution method have been investigated. These include appropriate strategies for scaling and matrix–vector product evaluations as well as block Jacobi and block Gauss–Seidel preconditioning techniques that preserve the modularity between subproblems. The monolithic solution method is applied to problems with varying degrees of fluid–structure coupling as well as a wing-span optimization study. In most cases, the monolithic solution algorithm requires 20–70% less computing time than its partitioned counterpart. This advantage increases with increasing wing flexibility. Robustness of the monolithic solution method is shown via its reduced sensitivity to the choice of problem-dependent solution parameters as well as its ability to converge when the partitioned method fails.",56,3
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056477,"In this paper, a deployment simulation model for next-generation aerospace structures, such as satellite solar panels and deployable wing aircraft, is proposed. The model utilizes finite plate elements based on absolute nodal coordinate formulation that has many advantages, namely, a constant mass matrix, zero Coriolis and centrifugal forces, a simple description of constraint conditions, and applicability of large elastic deformation. However, two problems have prevented the plate element from being utilized for simulation. The first problem is the absence of the deployment system model composed of the actuator torque considering compound rotation angles, holding/releasing, and latching mechanisms in the plate element. A deployment system model that addresses this need is therefore proposed. The second problem is a long calculation time, which is highly undesirable because many parametric simulations are necessary for the deployment system design. The long calculation time is due to the strong nonlinearity of the plate element and many joint constraint conditions. To solve this problem, this paper introduces the mitigation of the nonlinearity, component mode synthesis, and velocity transformation into the plate element. The proposed model succeeds in simulating the deployment of the solar panel and deployable wing aircraft with a significant reduction of the calculation time.",56,3
