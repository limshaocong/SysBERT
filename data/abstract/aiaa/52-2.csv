0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051989,"In this study, the proper orthogonal decomposition method in conjunction with a Galerkin projection scheme is employed to solve the title problem of a fluttering plate in both two and three dimensions undergoing supersonic flow using von Kármán’s large deflection plate theory and quasi-steady supersonic aerodynamic theory. Proper-orthogonal-decomposition-based reduced-order models are constructed by using the responses as snapshots from the conventional Galerkin method, which also plays a role as a reference method in this paper. Results for the buckled, limit cycle oscillation, and chaotic responses of the simply supported plate are presented and compared with the Galerkin solutions. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proper orthogonal decomposition reduced-order model permits a much lower-dimensional model as compared to that obtainable via the Galerkin approach. For example, for a plate length-to-width ratio equal to 4, only two proper orthogonal decomposition modes are required to describe the panel oscillation with good accuracy. This produces a reduction in the computational time to less than 3 s in comparison with almost 900 s when using the 16 modes required to obtain the same accuracy with the Galerkin approach.",52,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052031,"An approach to reduce the computational effort required to determine the worst-case gust loads for aircraft is described, specifically when structural modifications are included as part of the design process. The Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula is employed to determine the gust response of the modified structure using a reanalysis approach and to undertake an efficient modal reanalysis. The approach is demonstrated successfully using a simple wing and full-scale aircraft finite-element models to determine the worst-case “” gust following structural modification. Savings of about 56% were achieved for gust-response computations and 50% for the modal reanalysis.",52,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052208,"A novel reduced-order modeling method based on proper orthogonal decomposition for predicting steady, turbulent flows subject to aerodynamic constraints is introduced. Model-order reduction is achieved by replacing the governing equations of computational fluid dynamics with a nonlinear weighted least-squares optimization problem, which aims at finding the flow solution restricted to the low-order proper orthogonal decomposition subspace that features the smallest possible computational fluid dynamics residual. As a second and new ingredient, aerodynamic constraints are added to the nonlinear least-squares problem. It is demonstrated that the constrained nonlinear least-squares problem can be solved almost as efficiently as its unconstrained counterpart and outperforms all alternative approaches known to the authors. The method is applied to data fusion, seeking to combine the use of computational fluid dynamics with wind-tunnel or flight testing to improve the prediction of aerodynamic loads. It is also demonstrated that it can be used to compute aerodynamic loads for a given aerodynamic configuration subject to aerodynamic design or performance targets. Exemplary results considering both applications are computed for the NACA 64A010 airfoil and the DLR-F15 high-lift configuration.",52,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052303,"The strand-Cartesian grid approach offers many advantages in terms of automation, efficiency, and accuracy for complex moving-body problems, such as rotorcraft. In this study, the solution procedures for strand grids are investigated by testing a variety of explicit, implicit, and hybrid methods on canonical aerodynamics test cases involving inviscid and viscous flows in three dimensions. A novel multigrid algorithm is formulated that acts at both the nonlinear pseudotime level and the linear level using line Gauss–Seidel sweeps. Various approximations are tested for the Jacobian, and the impacts on memory and convergence are quantified. The major result is that implicit schemes with first-order approximate Jacobians employing few Gauss–Seidel sweeps are most efficient for strand grids. The improvement by using the multigrid algorithm is significant for all cases tested and indicates convergence.",52,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052368,"Stochastic methods are widely used because they constitute a low-cost computational-fluid-dynamics approach to synthesize a turbulent velocity field from time-averaged variables of a flowfield. A new combined stochastic method based on the sweeping hypothesis is introduced in this paper. This phenomenon, stating that inertial range structures are advected by the energy containing eddies, is known to be an important mechanism of the turbulent velocity field decorrelation process. The proposed method presents the advantage of being easily implementable and applicable to any three-dimensional configuration as long as a steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computation of the flow is available and assuming that the considered turbulence physics is compatible with the hypotheses made to build the current numerical model. The developed method is applied on a subsonic round cold free jet. The validation study shows that the synthesized turbulent velocity fields reproduce statistical features of the flow, such as two-point two-time velocity correlation functions, comparable to those found experimentally and integrates shear effects of the mean flow. The mean convection velocity of the turbulent structures is also correctly modeled. In addition, the turbulent kinetic energy spatial distribution is preserved by the stochastic method.",52,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J010000,"Fluidic injection on a supersonic jet operating at design and imperfectly expanded conditions was investigated. The nozzle simulates tactical military jet nozzles with conical sections and 12 pairs of fluidic injectors were incorporated into the nozzle lip. The effect of fluidic injection was studied at the design Mach number of 1.56, underexpanded, and overexpanded conditions. Far-field acoustic and flowfield measurements are presented for various injector momentum flux ratios at different jet operating conditions. The three velocity components were measured in cross-stream planes to compute the mean velocity and turbulence kinetic energy. At all conditions, increasing the injector momentum flux ratio resulted in greater reduction of noise. At overexpanded conditions, overall reduction up to 4 and 3 dB was observed at forward and downstream angles, respectively. At nozzle design conditions, up to 15 dB reduction in shock noise was observed in the narrowband spectra. Fluidic injection was more effective than chevrons at design and overexpanded conditions, though not at underexpanded conditions. Noise reduction was strongly dependent on the initial streamwise vorticity strength and the persistence of the vortices in the jet.",52,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052459,"The feasibility of harvesting energy using polyvinylidene fluoride patches mounted on a vibrating prestressed membrane, itself attached to a tensegrity structure, was investigated. Kinematics of the tensegrity structure and the attached membrane is described and conditions for stable equilibrium for the structure are derived. Nonlinear partial differential equations describing the dynamics of the membrane attached to the tensegrity structure and under the action of a time-dependent transverse pressure are derived using the principle of virtual work. These equations are linearized and the modes of the structure are obtained using the finite element method. These modes are used as basis functions in developing a reduced-order model to obtain the response of the complete structure under the applied transverse dynamic pressure. The polyvinylidene fluoride patch on the structure is connected to an electrical load resistance. The electrical current passing through the load resistance is calculated using Gauss’s law. From this, the amount of energy available for harvesting is estimated. Next, a genetic-algorithm-based optimization is performed to find the polyvinylidene fluoride patch locations, the rest length of the tendons, and the rest dimensions of the membrane, which maximize the amount of energy that can be harvested.",52,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052406,"A method for wing-shape optimization is presented, in which the wing outer shape is optimized not only for the best aerodynamic efficiency but also for the minimum structural weight. The so-called airfoil effective distance is used to capture the influence of the wing outer shape on the wing-box structural weight. The airfoil weight index is defined based on the airfoil effective distance. Increasing the airfoil weight index results in decreasing the structural weight. The weight indexing method is used for airfoil multi-objective optimization for minimizing the aerodynamic drag as well as maximizing the weight index. The Pareto front for the drag and weight is found, and the airfoils on the Pareto front are used as the basis airfoils for a three-dimensional wing-shape optimization. The same method is applied to optimize the outer shape of three-dimensional wings for two objective functions: minimizing the wing drag and minimizing the wing structural weight. A response surface methodology is used to reduce the computational costs of the wing-shape optimization. The influence of the material used in the wing-box structure on the wing optimum outer shape is also investigated. Three different composite layups together with a metal alloy are tested. The aircraft maximum takeoff weight and the aircraft direct operating cost are used as the design figures of merit to identify the best wings among the wings on the Pareto fronts. The results show that the optimum wing outer shape is significantly influenced by the material used in the wing-box structure.",52,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052479,"Multipoint surface shear stress and hot-wire velocity measurements were obtained within a three-dimensional, swept-wing boundary layer. Proper orthogonal decomposition, spectra, and spatial correlations were used to identify the presence of flow structures and their spatial evolution. The first proper orthogonal decomposition crossflow spatial eigenmode from the shear stress obtained in the laminar region has a wavelength of 12 mm, which is consistent with the crossflow vortex spanwise periodicity. The first proper orthogonal decomposition crossflow spatial eigenmode obtained in the turbulent region is not nearly as distinct, but a large spatial structure approximately 24 mm in span is observed, suggesting that, through the transition process, two neighboring crossflow vortices are interacting with a stronger one, canceling a close weaker one. The proper orthogonal decomposition was also applied in span to hot-wire velocity measurements at 3 mm above the wing surface in both the laminar and turbulent regimes. Flow structure in the turbulent flow regime has been identified that is very similar to that obtained in the laminar transition zone. This suggests that the initial instability and transition physics continue to play a key role even after the flow has transitioned to turbulence.",52,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052381,"Particle image velocimetry was used to characterize the flowfield on flat plates of aspect ratios 2 and 4 undergoing a starting rotation motion at Reynolds numbers, based on tip velocity, of 4,000, 8,000, and 16,000. The starting motion was performed in a tank of quiescent water. For both aspect ratios, a leading-edge vortex was observed on the suction surface of the plate, and its evolution and circulation were characterized with variations in angle of attack, Reynolds number, and azimuthal and spanwise positions. A region of strong counter-rotating vorticity was also observed between the leading-edge vortex and the plate surface, which becomes entrained by the leading-edge vortex. The circulation of the leading-edge vortex, when rendered dimensionless by the plate chord length and tip speed, was found to be relatively insensitive to Reynolds number and the azimuthal position of the plate within the ranges of the measurements; however, a strong (approximately linear) dependence on angle of attack was observed such that the leading-edge vortex circulation generally exceeded the bound circulation predicted by thin airfoil theory at the same local velocity. A significant collapse of the leading-edge vortex circulation was observed when normalized by the theoretical bound circulation, suggesting that this may be a useful tool for predicting leading-edge vortex strength.",52,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052485,"A single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator is employed for flow control on the pressure side of a natural laminar flow wing section under free-flight conditions. A full-sized motorized glider is equipped with the flow-control device and data-acquisition hardware to quantify the impact of the actuator on boundary-layer transition. A transition delay of approximately 3% chord is achieved, quantified by microphone and hot-wire measurements. Simultaneously, the influence of the variable ambient conditions on the flow-control performance is characterized. A closed-loop control algorithm enables constant actuator performance, despite varying humidity, temperature, and density throughout the test flights. The energy efficiency of the flow-control approach is estimated, providing a positive outlook for further improvements and a net benefit of transition control. Finally, a numerical procedure is presented to quantitatively estimate the effect of dielectric barrier discharge actuation on boundary-layer transition to enhance the design of flow-control experiments.",52,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052516,"The study of high-Reynolds-number wall-bounded turbulent flows has become a very active area of research in the past decade, where several recent results have challenged current understanding. In this study, four different localized pressure gradient configurations are characterized by computing them using four Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence models (Spalart–Allmaras, , shear stress transport, and the Reynolds stress model) and comparing their predictions with experimental measurements of mean flow quantities and wall shear stress. The pressure gradients were imposed on high-Reynolds-number, two-dimensional turbulent boundary layers developing on a flat plate by changing the ceiling geometry of the test section. The computations showed that the shear stress transport model produced the best agreement with the experiments. It was found that what is called “numerical transition” (a procedure by which the laminar boundary conditions are transformed into inflow conditions to characterize the initial turbulent profile) causes the major differences between the various models, thereby highlighting the need for models representative of true transition in computational codes. Also, both experiments and computations confirm the nonuniversality of the von Kármán coefficient . Finally, a procedure is demonstrated for simpler two-dimensional computations that can be representative of flows with some mild three-dimensional geometries.",52,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052530,"Numerical computations are carried out to predict the transition generated by excrescence on a platelike geometry in subsonic flow. Both forward-facing and rearward-facing steps of small roughness height are considered in the investigation. These are representative of joints and other surface imperfections on wing sections that disrupt laminar flow, thereby increasing skin friction and drag. Solutions are obtained via a high-fidelity numerical scheme and an implicit time-marching approach on an overset mesh system that is used to represent the steps. Very-small-amplitude numerical forcing is employed to generate perturbations, which are amplified by the geometric disturbances, similar to the physical situation. The flowfield just downstream of the steps is characterized by the growth and breakdown of two-dimensional fluid structures. Because all significant scales of the flow are fully resolved in this region, the solutions there correspond to direct numerical simulations. Further downstream where the flow is more fully turbulent, the calculations are regarded as large-eddy simulations. Details of the numerical procedure are summarized, and features of the flowfields are described, which help to elucidate the transition process. Comparisons are made with the available experimental data in terms of time-mean skin-friction measurements. The locations of transition and skin-friction levels predicted numerically are in close correspondence with the experiments. A grid-resolution study was carried out to confirm the accuracy of the computations. In the fully turbulent region downstream of the transition, calculations agree with the expected behavior, but have not yet evolved to the high-Reynolds-number asymptotic form.",52,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052544,"A new efficient and accurate approach to robust structural topology optimization is developed in this work. The objective is to minimize the expected compliance of structures under loading uncertainty. The new approach is akin to a deterministic multiple load case problem where the load cases and weights are derived by numerical methods. Efficient and accurate methods to compute expected compliance and its derivatives are developed for both concentrated and distributed uncertain loads. The Monte Carlo method and matrix decomposition are employed for concentrated loads, and the Karhunen–Loeve expansion and its orthogonal properties of random variables are used for distributed loads. Numerical examples using the modified solid isotropic material with penalization approach are provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.",52,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052545,"A novel domain decomposition technique is applied that couples nonlinear and linear Euler solvers to model acoustic scattering of waves in the vicinity of high-velocity gradients and large-amplitude waves to reduce numerical resources. The linear solver is applied in domains in which the wave amplitude is small and linearization is applicable, whereas the nonlinear solver is used in the vicinity of high wave amplitudes and stagnation points. Three numerical models are compared in this paper: 1) a linear Euler, 2) a nonlinear Euler, and 3) the domain decomposition technique. For all three models, the finite difference dispersion relation preserving scheme is applied to all spatial derivatives and the low-dissipation–dispersion Runge–Kutta scheme is applied for the temporal integration. A perfectly matched layer is applied at the edges of the computational domain to absorb outgoing waves and minimize reflections. To include complex bodies and geometries, an overset mesh is applied. After model validation, the technique is applied to the acoustic scattering of a pulse and a periodic source from a circular cylinder in flow. The results conclude that a thin zone around a complex body is sufficient to accurately account for nonlinear effects in the vicinity of stagnation points and that the domain decomposition technique accurately predicts both the unsteady field and integral unsteady forces about bluff bodies compared with full nonlinear simulations. The results suggest that there is a 40% reduction in computational time using the domain decomposition technique compared with full nonlinear calculations.",52,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052573,"The integrated local Petrov–Galerkin sinc method was used with an irreversible exponential traction-separation constitutive law for modeling mode I and mixed-mode delamination of an adhesively bonded aluminum and hybrid plane-strain and plane-stress structural specimen. The first-order shear deformable theory was used to model the specimen both above and below the delamination with the sublaminate interfaces coupled to each other through the cohesive zone model. Through-the-sublaminate-thickness distributions of interlaminar stresses were obtained using integration of the equilibrium equations of three-dimensional elasticity. An adaptive discretization technique is developed and implemented. Because the sinc points, distributed by the double exponential transformation, are biased toward the boundary in the integrated local Petrov–Galerkin sinc method, the adaptive sinc point distribution allows an accurate solution to be obtained with far fewer sinc points than when a single subdomain is used. The results indicated excellent correlation between the integrated local Petrov–Galerkin sinc method results and the finite element method results obtained using cohesive elements in ABAQUS. The results were also compared with experimental results. The integrated local Petrov–Galerkin sinc method results and finite element analysis results correlated well with the experimental results. Because the integrated local Petrov–Galerkin sinc method approximates higher-order derivatives of strain, the method is well suited for use with this class of problems.",52,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052582,"Previous studies of transonic shock control bumps have often been either numerical or experimental. Comparisons between the two have been hampered by the limitations of either approach. The present work aims to bridge the gap between computational fluid dynamics and experiment by planning a joint approach from the outset. This enables high-quality validation data to be produced and ensures that the conclusions of either aspect of the study are directly relevant to the application. Experiments conducted with bumps mounted on the floor of a blowdown tunnel were modified to include an additional postshock adverse pressure gradient through the use of a diffuser as well as introducing boundary-layer suction ahead of the test section to enable the in-flow boundary layer to be manipulated. This has the advantage of being an inexpensive and highly repeatable method. Computations were performed on a standard airfoil model, with the flight conditions as free parameters. The experimental and computational setups were then tuned to produce baseline conditions that agree well, enabling confidence that the experimental conclusions are relevant. The methods are then applied to two different shock control bumps: a smoothly contoured bump, representative of previous studies, and a novel extended geometry featuring a continuously widening tail, which spans the wind-tunnel width at the rear of the bump. Comparison between the computational and experimental results for the contour bump showed good agreement both with respect to the flow structures and quantitative analysis of the boundary-layer parameters. It was seen that combining the experimental and numerical data could provide valuable insight into the flow physics, which would not generally be possible for a one-sided approach. The experiments and computational fluid dynamics were also seen to agree well for the extended bump geometry, providing evidence that, even though the bump interacts directly with the wind-tunnel walls, it was still possible to observe the key flow physics. The joint approach is thus suitable even for wider bump geometries.",52,2
