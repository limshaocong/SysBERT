2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055051,"The wake behind a circular cylinder is studied to investigate the complex vortex shedding physics in the near-wake region. Both the criterion and a Lagrangian coherent structure analysis are applied to flowfields acquired from a numerical simulation, as well as from experimental particle image velocimetry to determine the properties of the wake. A rate-of-strain filter is applied to the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field to filter out ridges corresponding to local shear, and yields ridges along which fluid trajectories separate hyperbolically. This strain filter reveals a sudden loss of hyperbolicity along a Lagrangian coherent structure as a new vortex begins to form. The Lagrangian coherent structures are also shown to identify and track topological Lagrangian saddle points in the cylinder near wake. This information characterizes the behavior of the vortices as they form, shed, and convect downstream. In particular, a Lagrangian saddle point is observed to remain attached to the cylinder surface until the vortex separates, and then consequently accelerates downstream with a similar track in both numerical and experimental results. The present approach provides a novel criterion for the identification of vortex shedding.",55,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054498,"Particle image velocimetry measurements with high spatial resolution were conducted on a hovering two-bladed rotor system operating in ground effect above a planar surface. The objective was to gain a better understanding of the fluid dynamics of the wake sheets trailed behind rotating blades, with specific focus on their contribution to the development of the near-wall flowfield at the ground plane. Two blade sets were tested: 1) a baseline untwisted blade and 2) a twisted blade with 17 deg of nose-down linear twist. Planar particle image velocimetry measurements were made for multiple regions of interest in the rotor wake to understand the temporal development of the wake sheets as they convected from their origin at the trailing edges of the blades until they interacted with the ground. The wake sheets were shown to contain relatively large amounts of concentrated vorticity, which persisted much longer in the wake than for the corresponding out of ground effect case. The wake sheet substantially influenced the nature of the developing flow over the ground, resulting in relatively large and higher transient excursions in the near-wall flow velocities further inboard and closer to the rotor. Performance measurements were also taken for both blade sets at various heights above the ground, with the untwisted blades showing the most significant increase in performance.",55,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055262,"This paper presents an experimental investigation of small-scale model airframe noise at various Reynolds numbers up to the real flight case. The study consists of data acquired with a microphone array in the European Transonic Wind Tunnel. The advantage of this wind tunnel is to enable testing simultaneously at cryogenic temperatures and increased pressure levels, which extends the range of achievable Reynolds numbers up to those pertaining to full-scale flight conditions. At the DLR, German Aerospace Center, the microphone array measurement technique has been further developed to perform measurements under combined cryogenic and pressurized conditions. For this purpose, a microphone array consisting of 96 microphones was designed and constructed. In this paper, aeroacoustic results are presented for various Reynolds numbers up to the real flight case on an Airbus K3DY half-model of scale . The results showed significant Reynolds number and Mach number dependency for various sources. Of particular note are various dominant sources appearing on the flap at real flight Reynolds numbers. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first time that airframe noise data for a small-scale model have been acquired at real flight Reynolds numbers.",55,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055088,"This paper describes a novel computational-fluid-dynamics-based numerical solution procedure for effective simulation of aerothermoacoustics problems with application to aerospace vehicles. A finite element idealization is employed for both fluid and structure domains, which fully accounts for thermal effects. The accuracies of both the fluid and structure capabilities are verified with flight- and ground-test data. A time integration of the structural equations of motion , with the governing flow equations, is conducted for the computation of the unsteady aerodynamic forces, which uses a transpiration boundary condition at the surface nodal points in lieu of the updating of the fluid mesh. Two example problems are presented herein to that effect. The first one relates to a cantilever wing with a NACA 0012 airfoil. The solution results demonstrate the effect of temperature loading that causes a significant increase in acoustic response. A second example, the hypersonic X-43 vehicle, is also analyzed; and relevant results are presented. The common finite element-based aerothermoelastic-acoustics simulation process, its applicability to the efficient and routine solution of complex practical problems, the employment of the effective transpiration boundary condition in the computational fluid dynamics solution, and the development and public domain distribution of an associated code are unique features of this paper.",55,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054797,"The flight effects on the properties of the mixing layer and the shock-cell system of slightly underexpanded supersonic jets are studied experimentally. Particle image velocimetry, schlieren visualizations, and pressure measurements are used in a dual-stream geometry whose outer flow simulates flight up to a Mach number of 0.4. The study of the mixing layer includes the evolution under simulated flight of the turbulence levels, the momentum thickness, and of integral length and time scales of turbulence. The turbulence levels are found constant in flight when defined as the ratio between peak velocity fluctuations and velocity difference across the mixing layer. The analysis of the shock-cell structure comprises an evaluation of flight effects on the length of the entire pattern, and on the length and strength of the individual shock cells. The shock-cell structure is stretched in flight, as well as each shock cell. This comes from the reduced mixing-layer growth occurring under flight conditions. The stretching of the pattern is accompanied by a decrease in strength of the first few shock cells.",55,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054977,"The closely spaced twin-jet configuration often seen in military aircraft is distinct from the single jet in both the flowfield and acoustic field. The twin-jet plumes interact with each other weakly or strongly, depending upon the distance between the two jets, the jet operating flow regime, and the Mach number. In the current study, the interaction mechanisms and coupling of a supersonic twin jet exhausting from biconical converging–diverging nozzles with a design Mach number of 1.23 at a separation distance of two nozzle exit diameters are investigated using near-field pressure measurements and phase-locked flow visualization. Across a series of jet operating Mach numbers, the twin-jet plumes feature three major jet azimuthal modes: axisymmetric, helical, and flapping. The jet flapping mode is strongly augmented in the twin-jet configuration compared to the single-jet case. Along the twin-jet plane, which is also the plane of the jet flapping direction, jet plumes with coherent flow structures are observed to move up and down. Because of the nature of the jet flapping motion, the near-field pressure fluctuations are markedly amplified at low Strouhal numbers, particularly along the twin-jet plane for further downstream locations where the coherent structures are developed and large. Localized arc filament plasma actuators are implemented as an active flow control tool on both nozzles, just upstream of nozzle exit, to explore the coupling mechanisms. The results show that decoupling and coupling of twin-jet plumes can both be achieved, depending on the jet operating condition and the excitation parameters employed.",55,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055044,"A computational method tailored for the simulation of fluidic thrust-vectoring systems is employed to investigate the dynamic response of a dual-throat nozzle in open- and closed-loop control. Thrust vectoring in fixed, symmetric nozzles is obtained by secondary flow injections that cause local flow separations, asymmetric pressure distributions, and, as a consequence, the vectoring of primary jet flow. The computational technique is based on a well-assessed mathematical model for the compressible unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. A minimal control system governs the unsteady blowing. Nozzle performances and thrust-vector angles have been computed for a wide range of nozzle pressure ratios and secondary flow injection rates. The numerical results are compared with the experimental data available in the open literature. Several computations of the open-loop dynamics of the nozzle under different forcing have been performed to investigate the system response in terms of thrust-vectoring effectiveness and controllability. These computations have been used to extract autoregressive exogenous models of the nozzle dynamics. The effects of including the actuator dynamics are also discussed. Simple strategies of closed-loop control of the nozzle system by proportional–integrative–derivative regulators are investigated numerically. The closed-loop model predictive control of the system, based on the autoregressive exogenous models, is addressed.",55,1

Air and helium are employed as cooling gases and are injected with a low rate in the wall-normal direction through a single infinite spanwise slit into the laminar or turbulent boundary-layer flow. The blowing is realized by prescribing a fixed distribution of the cooling-gas mass flux, mass fraction, and temperature at either the orifice location without the cooling-gas channel (modeled blowing) or at the lower end of the included blowing channel (simulated/interacting blowing), thus allowing for an interaction of the main and cooling-gas flows. The influence of the modeling, the main-flow boundary-layer state, and the cooling-gas type on the film-cooling effectiveness and the skin-friction alteration is scrutinized; and valuable data for the validation of less costly computational fluid dynamics methods employing turbulence models are gained from this fundamental study.",55,1

The generation of shock waves and a high-temperature region are observed, with a corresponding temperature increase of (, ) and (, ) produced with a 175 mm focusing lens. The spatial profile of the temperature rise along the beam is found to scale linearly with the optical emission intensity. The transverse width of the emission region is also observed to correlate with increased temperature. Rayleigh polarimetry measurements show a high dissociation fraction of up to (, ). Modeling of three-body recombination into the state using the measured dissociation fraction is able to reproduce the emission intensity time history between 1 and . Local heating is found to play a key role in the observed trends in the spatial profile, width, intensity, and temporal evolution of femtosecond laser tagging at laser intensities near or above .",55,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054891,"The commonly accepted description of spatial transition to turbulence in a convectively unstable boundary layer involves as one of its stages the permanent excitation of instabilities by external noise (receptivity). The idea that thermal fluctuations of microscopic origin provide a sufficient amount of permanent noise to play a role in this process has made only scant and isolated appearances in the literature. Yet, the contribution of thermal noise to receptivity has its amplitude determined from physical first principles; it provides the lower bound beyond which disturbances cannot be reduced (and the upper bound beyond which transition cannot be delayed) lest thermodynamics is violated. As it is also not significantly harder to compute than a typical -factor plot, thermal-noise receptivity can be adopted as a standard against which to compare other forms of receptivity through a noise figure analogous to the one that is of commonplace use in electronics. Elaborating on previous computations of the effect of thermal noise upon the two-dimensional boundary layer past a flat plate, it is shown by a few real-world examples that the receptivity to thermal noise of the crossflow boundary layer over a swept wing is even larger, and by a substantial amount.",55,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054939,"The effect of wall temperature on the size of the separation bubble in the shock wave/turbulent boundary-layer interaction of a 24 deg compression ramp with Mach 2.9 is numerically investigated. The ratios of wall temperature to recovery temperature are 0.6, 1.14, 1.4, and 2.0, respectively. To validate the simulation, the statistical results with are tested and the results show a good agreement with theoretical and experimental results. It is shown that wall temperature has a remarkable effect on the size of the separation bubble and the size increases significantly with the increase of wall temperature. Through theoretical analysis, combined with numerical results, we get a semitheoretical formula , in which and are the length of the separation bubble and the thickness of upstream boundary layer, respectively. The turbulent kinetic energy budgets are also analyzed based on the numerical data, and results show that turbulence kinetic energy is chiefly produced both in the buffer layer and near the shock wave, and turbulent dissipation is mainly in the center of the separation bubble as well as in the near-wall region. It is also shown that the intrinsic compressibility effect is not significant in all these cases.",55,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055190,"The first-order multidimensional flux difference splitting method (Parent, B., “Multidimensional Flux Difference Splitting Schemes,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 53, No. 7, 2015, pp. 1936–1948) is here extended to second-order accuracy through the use of limiters. The proposed second-order flux functions are such that they collapse to the first-order multidimensional flux difference splitting stencil in the vicinity of discontinuities and tend toward second-order finite difference stencils in smooth parts of the solution. Various test cases of interest to hypersonic flight including supersonic ramp injectors, shock-induced boundary-layer separation, and hypersonic viscous layers reveal that the proposed method achieves as much as a four times increase in resolution per dimension over its first-order counterpart or over the second-order symmetric total variation diminishing schemes. When integrated through a block-implicit approach, this entails as much as a 40-fold increase in computational efficiency while not compromising the symmetric total variation diminishing reliable convergence to steady-state, essentially monotone solution, and high resolution of boundary layers.",55,1

The proposed methodology was then used to predict the flutter boundary for the range of Mach numbers.",55,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055049,"In some cases, a multinozzle combustor may exhibit flowfields in which individual nozzles hold two distinct flow or flame shapes in an alternating pattern. This study presents flowfield measurements for nonreacting and reacting flows in a rectangular combustor with two adjacent swirl-stabilizing nozzles at varying internozzle spacing. During tests of the wider nozzle spacings, with a reacting flow fueled by propane, there are differences between the flows of the two nozzles. Planar laser-induced fluorescence of the OH molecule (OH PLIF) shows that the flame remains anchored in the shear layer. Thus, the flame from one nozzle penetrates into the combustor, whereas the other flame is anchored close to, and almost parallel with, the dome wall. When the fuel is changed to methane, the asymmetry between the two nozzles is removed; therefore, the combustion properties, in addition to nozzle design, have an effect on the presence of this alternating flow pattern. A hypothesis based on turbulent opposed jets is presented to explain this change in the flowfields. When the nozzle design, flow, or combustion characteristics cause the shear layers of the adjacent nozzles to become sufficiently opposite in direction, the two flows can no longer mix. Instead, one shear layer goes underneath the other, which results in the differing flow features of the adjacent nozzles.",55,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054974,"To investigate the flame stabilization and propagation in a dual-mode scramjet with two-staged-strut injectors, a series of fuel dynamic adjustment experiments was conducted at the inlet Mach numbers of 2.0 and 3.0, and the corresponding inflow stagnation temperatures were 1231 and 1899 K, respectively. A linearly adjustable venturi was designed to realize the continuous control on the fuel mass flow rate. A high-speed imaging camera was used to record the flame structure during the combustion. The effects of the local equivalence ratio, the adjustment process of the fuel mass flow rate, and the inflow conditions on the combustor performance were experimentally analyzed. The results show that the flame can only be stabilized in the recirculation region or two thin regions of the upstream strut under the lower inflow enthalpy condition, and the flame is blown out when the fuel flow rate is below the lean blowout limit. Comparatively, under the higher inflow enthalpy condition, an additional stabilized flame could be found in the boundary-layer separation region of the side walls, and the combustion waves were observed intermittently. The sudden changes in the wall pressure profiles and an obvious hysteresis phenomenon were found in the fuel dynamic adjustment procedure under the lower inflow enthalpy condition. However, the flame structure and corresponding wall pressure profile changed continuously, illustrating a much smaller hysteresis phenomenon under the higher inflow enthalpy condition.",55,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055270,"The effects of single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators on flow control are studied using a new frequency and pressure-dependent capacitance-based model by calculating the spatiotemporal distribution of surface charge density in the present work. The proposed model is an improvement over earlier similar efforts, but it retains the superior features of previous macroscopic models. It can be used to accurately compute the spatiotemporal distribution of body force due to plasma actuation without computing the complex electrodynamics equations for charge density on microscopic scales. It has been shown that the proposed model estimates the time-averaged total body force more accurately than similar models developed earlier, as compared to experimental results. The effects of plasma excitation frequency and the voltage waveform were considered. The proposed model has been incorporated into a Navier–Stokes equation solver in a time-accurate manner to study single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuation in a quiescent flow environment. The onset of plasma actuation causes the creation of a complex transient vortical flowfield: one of its actions is to create a wall jet. Computed instantaneous velocity profiles at downstream locations show this wall jet, and they are compared with the experimental results. The computed results of the evolution of a starting vortex in a quiescent air induced by initiation of single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuation display an excellent match with the experimental results of Whalley and Choi (“ The Starting Vortex in Quiescent Air Induced by Dielectric-Barrier-Discharge Plasma ,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics , Vol.  55 , July 2012 , pp.  192 – 203 ).",55,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054902,"The goal of this work is to quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity of commonly used turbulence models in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes codes due to uncertainty in the values of closure coefficients for transonic wall-bounded flows and to rank the contribution of each coefficient to uncertainty in various output flow quantities of interest. Specifically, uncertainty quantification of turbulence model closure coefficients is performed for transonic flow over an axisymmetric bump and the RAE 2822 transonic airfoil. Three turbulence models are considered: the Spalart–Allmaras model, Wilcox (2006) model, and Menter shear-stress transport model. The FUN3D code developed by NASA Langley Research Center is used as the flow solver. The uncertainty quantification analysis employs stochastic expansions based on non-intrusive polynomial chaos for efficient uncertainty propagation. Several integrated and point quantities are considered as uncertain outputs for both computational fluid dynamics problems. Closure coefficients are treated as epistemic uncertain variables represented with intervals. Sobol indices are used to rank the relative contributions of each closure coefficient to the total uncertainty in the output quantities of interest. This study identifies a number of closure coefficients for each turbulence model for which more information will reduce the amount of uncertainty in the output significantly for transonic wall-bounded flows.",55,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054832,"To improve the efficiency and quality of solving expensive engineering design optimization problems, recently metamodel-based design and optimization technologies have been widely employed. In this paper, a novel adaptive metamodel-based optimization method called sequential radial basis function using support vector machine is proposed to solve the practical engineering optimization problems involving computationally expensive objective and constraints. The proposed metamodel-based optimization method uses the radial basis function metamodel to approximate the expensive simulations in the interesting sampling region, which is a subregion of the design space. To identify the interesting sampling region, a novel feature space fuzzy -means clustering method is proposed to obtain the cluster center of superior cheap points classified by support vector machine. The procedure of sequential radial basis function using support vector machine is presented first, and the interesting sampling region and feature space fuzzy -means clustering methods are discussed in detail. Several numerical benchmark problems are used to compare the proposed method with other well-known metamodel-based design and optimization methods including efficient global optimization, multiple surrogate efficient global optimization methodology, mode-pursuing sampling, constraint importance mode pursuing sampling, and constrained optimization by radial basis function interpolation. The comparison results show that the proposed method generally outperforms the competitive methods in terms of efficiency, convergence, and robustness. Finally, sequential radial basis function using support vector machine is applied in an Earth observation satellite multidisciplinary design optimization problem. The results illustrate that compared with genetic algorithm and sequential quadratic programming, the proposed method can find a better solution with fewer function evaluations, which demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method in solving real-world engineering design optimization problems.",55,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055102,"Two aerodynamic shape optimization geometry control methods, B-spline surface control and free-form deformation, are applied to three optimization problems and compared on the bases of optimal shape performance and problem setup ease of use. For both methods, the geometry is parameterized using B-spline surfaces with mesh movement accomplished using an efficient integrated technique. Gradients for the optimization algorithm are computed using the adjoint method. The first problem is a wing twist optimization under inviscid, subsonic flow, achieving an elliptical load distribution. The second is a lift-constrained drag minimization of a wing under transonic flow based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The third involves lift-to-drag-ratio maximization, based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, beginning from a classically shaped blended wing–body aircraft and converging to a lifting-fuselage configuration. B-spline surface control is often found to result in slightly better performance; however, in general, both methods perform equally well. Free-form deformation provides a more general approach to problem setup, decoupling geometry control from parameterization. Overall, the results suggest that B-spline surface control is better suited for simple geometries, such as wings, whereas free-form deformation is better suited for complex geometries, such as unconventional aircraft, and for implementation with multistart algorithms and adaptive geometry control approaches.",55,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054729,"Simulation models with different levels of fidelity have been widely used in engineering design. Even though the nonhierarchical multimodel fusion approach has been developed for integrating data from multiple competing low-fidelity models and a high-fidelity model, how to allocate samples from multifidelity models for the purpose of design optimization still remains challenging. In this work, a new multimodel fusion-based sequential optimization approach is proposed to address the issues of 1) where in the design space to allocate more samples, and 2) which model to evaluate at the chosen infilling sample sites. First, an objective-oriented sampling criterion that balances global exploration and local exploitation is employed to identify the infilling sample location to address the first question. To address the second question, an improved preposterior analysis is developed to determine which simulation model to evaluate, considering both predictive accuracy and computational cost. The improved preposterior analysis not only eliminates the time-consuming Monte Carlo loop in the conventional method but also adopts an analytical model updating formula to further improve the efficiency. To demonstrate the merits of the current proposed multimodel fusion-based sequential optimization approach, two numerical examples and a vehicle engine piston design example are tested. It is shown that the proposed multimodel fusion-based sequential optimization approach is capable of allocating samples from multifidelity models to sequentially update the predictive model for optimization at less computational cost compared to the conventional kriging-based sequential optimization approach.",55,1

Some of the pressure sensors were in between the laser sheet and camera, causing occlusions in the particle image velocimetry data. Using ideas from the data fusion community, these occluded regions could be repaired. In this case, the particle image velocimetry data could be fused with the knowledge that the velocity field was symmetric about the center axis using a new technique called fused proper orthogonal decomposition, which is inspired by gappy proper orthogonal decomposition and image/wavelet fusion. Using this technique, 90% of the missing data could be estimated with 10% error.",55,1

The damping ratio is estimated for the first mode for the case with small contact angle and its variation, as a fundamental study for propellant sloshing. First, the relation between the friction force and the change in the contact angle caused by contact angle hysteresis is derived from the equilibrium among the friction force and the three surface tensions. Next, the virtual work done by the friction force is calculated to determine the nonlinear damping term to be introduced into the modal equation for sloshing. Physical considerations are made for the dependencies of the damping ratio on the Bond number and filling level. Although the damping term arises from the second-order small term in the friction force, the damping ratio can reach the same order as the viscous damping ratio for low Bond numbers because, due to the hysteresis nonlinearity, the friction damping ratio increases with decreasing Bond number more markedly than the viscous ratio.",55,1
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055398,"In recent years, driven by the increasingly stringent stability requirements imposed by some satellites’ payloads (e.g., the new generation of optical instruments), the issue of accurate onboard spacecraft microvibration modeling has attracted significant interest from engineers and scientists. This paper investigates the microvibration-induced phenomenon on a cantilever-configured reaction wheel assembly including sub- and higher harmonic amplifications due to modal resonances and broadband noise. A mathematical model of the reaction wheel assembly is developed and validated against experimental test results. The model is capable of representing each configuration in which the reaction wheel assembly will operate, whether it is hard mounted on a dynamometric platform or suspended free–free. The outcomes of this analysis are used to establish a novel methodology to retrieve the dynamic mass of the reaction wheel assembly in its operative range of speeds. An alternative measurement procedure has been developed for this purpose, showing to produce good estimates over a wide range of frequencies using a less complex test campaign compared with typical dynamic mass setups. Furthermore, the gyroscopic effect influence in the reaction wheel assembly response is thoroughly examined both analytically and experimentally. Finally, to what extent the noise affects the convergence of the novel approach is investigated.",55,1

In this paper, a static analysis of sandwich panels with nonhomogeneous soft cores is performed by using the differential quadrature method. The material properties vary exponentially through the thickness according to a power-law form. To circumvent the difficulty in dealing with the discontinuity of the first-order derivative of material parameters encountered by point discrete methods, a novel modeling strategy is proposed. Only the top half of the core is analyzed, and the displacement and stress of the entire core are obtained by using the method of superposition. Detailed formulations are provided. Numerical results are presented to investigate the effect of the power-law exponent on the displacement and stress of the sandwich panels with nonhomogeneous soft cores.

A direct solution approach in cosimulation with fluid-dynamics solvers is also presented. Moving least squares are used to smooth and remap surface strain measurements, estimated from digital image correlation, as needed by the inverse solution meshing. The same approach is used to map the structural and fluid interface kinematics and loads during the fluid–structure cosimulation. Both the direct and the inverse analyses are validated by comparing the direct predictions and the reconstructed deformations with experimental data for prestressed rectangular membranes subjected to static and unsteady loads. The load distributions reconstructed using the inverse analysis are compared with the corresponding loads obtained using the direct analysis.

This paper presents a viscoelastic model for single-ply cylindrical shells (tape springs) that are deployed after being held folded for a given period of time. The model is derived from a representative unit cell of the composite material, based on the microstructure geometry. Key ingredients are the fiber volume density in the composite tows and the constitutive behavior of the fibers (assumed to be linear elastic and transversely isotropic) and of the matrix (assumed to be linear viscoelastic). Finite-element-based homogenizations at two scales are conducted to obtain the Prony series that characterize the orthotropic behavior of the composite tow, using the measured relaxation modulus of the matrix as an input. A further homogenization leads to the lamina relaxation matrix. The accuracy of the proposed model is verified against the experimentally measured time-dependent compliance of single lamina in either pure tension or pure bending. Finite element simulations of single-ply tape springs based on the proposed model are compared to experimental measurements that were also obtained during this study.",55,1
