Nonlinearities associated with leading-edge vortex development and flow separation push existing real-time-capable aerodynamics models beyond their predictive limits, which puts reliable real-time flight simulation and control out of reach. In the present development, a push toward realizing real-time-capable models with enhanced predictive performance for flight operations has been made by considering the simpler problem of modeling an aggressively pitching airfoil in a low-dimensional manner. A parameter-varying model, composed of three coupled quasi-linear sub-models, is proposed to approximate the lift, drag, and pitching-moment response of an airfoil to arbitrarily prescribed aggressive ramp–hold pitching kinematics. An output-error-minimization strategy is used to identify the low-dimensional quasi-linear parameter-varying sub-models from input–output data gathered from low-Reynolds-number direct numerical fluid dynamics simulations. The resulting models have noteworthy predictive capabilities for arbitrary ramp–hold pitching maneuvers spanning a broad range of operating points, thus making the models especially useful for aerodynamic optimization and real-time control and simulation.",55,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055244,"This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of the unsteady flow about pitching flat plates. Hydrodynamic force and two-dimensional particle image velocimetry measurements are reported for three pivot locations (leading edge, midchord, and trailing edge), reduced pitch rates from 0.022 to 0.39, and in still water, which corresponds to infinite reduced pitch rate. The wing has rectangular planform with effective aspect ratio 4, and the wing pitching motion is from 0 to 45 deg angle of attack. The relation between hydrodynamic force and vortical flow development as a function of pivot location and reduced pitch rate is discussed. Reasonable agreement is found between measured hydrodynamic force and quasi-steady potential flow theoretical results. Several vortical flow features are identified and discussed, including 1) the effect of pivot location and pitch acceleration on formation and evolution of vortical structures, 2) the impact of interaction between vortical flow structures on hydrodynamic force development, and 3) three-dimensional flow development and transient vortex development.",55,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054983,"Lifting surfaces often operate in highly unsteady inflow conditions, such as gusty wind or waves. These inflows are unsteady on many time scales and have to be considered stochastic processes. For fluid dynamics practitioners, this leads to a challenge: how can long-term, random design loads (e.g., fatigue or 20 year return extreme) be quantified efficiently? The conventional approach involves analysis of a large set of short-term inflow realizations and extrapolates the results to long-term loads via their assumed probability distributions. However, this requires separately solving many simulations. This is computationally expensive and presents a handicap, especially in early design stages (optimization), where rapid evaluations of candidate designs and performance gradients are required. To tackle this problem, we introduce two alternative stochastic methods: one based on a Galerkin projection onto Fourier modes, and the other based on a polynomial chaos expansion. This approach enables us to carry the randomness though the solution process to directly obtain a stochastic result. Thus, long-term loads can be directly constructed from the stochastic solution, without having to analyze specific realizations of the inflow inputs. The new processes are illustrated and discussed with an example based on a rectangular wing lifting-line model.",55,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055214,"Experimental and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the effects of acceleration and deceleration durations on the wake capture effects on three-dimensional fruit-fly-inspired flapping wings. The contribution from the wake capture to lift and drag coefficients was isolated by comparing the forces generated by a wing in a quiescent fluid where the wake capture effect was absent, with the forces generated in a periodic flowfield where the full wake capture effect was encountered. The results showed that wake capture caused lift and drag coefficients to increase noticeably at the start of each flapping stroke. Also, a reduction in deceleration duration enhanced the wake capture effect, and a reduction in acceleration duration caused an earlier onset of wake capture with no significant effect on the force magnitudes contributed by the wake capture. Moreover, the effect of reducing the acceleration and deceleration durations in the same flapping motion resembled superposition of the two individual effects. The present study helps toward a better understanding of the fluid dynamics of the wing–wake interaction.",55,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055243,"Strategies for trailing-edge noise control have been inspired by the downy canopy that covers the surface of exposed flight feathers of many owl species. Previous wind-tunnel measurements demonstrate that canopies of similar characteristics can reduce pressure fluctuations on the underlying surface by as much as 30 dB and significantly attenuate roughness noise generated by that surface. In the present work, surface treatments are designed to replicate the effects of the canopy in a form suitable for application to an airfoil. These treatments are installed directly upstream of the trailing edge to modify the boundary-layer turbulence before acoustic scattering by the edge. Over 20 variants of these designs have been tested by performing aeroacoustic wind-tunnel measurements on a tripped DU96-W180 airfoil at chord Reynolds numbers of up to 3 million. Compared with the unmodified airfoil, the treatments provided up to 10 dB of broadband attenuation of trailing-edge noise. The effectiveness of the treatment is not highly dependent on a particular geometry, but there appears to be strong potential for optimization. The surface treatments remain effective over an angle-of-attack range that extends over 9 deg from zero lift. Aerodynamic impact of the treatment appears minimal.",55,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055114,"Turbulence naturally returns to isotropy and often possesses locally isotropic regions. This paper presents a new method to predict noise from turbulence that has returned or is returning to isotropy. The Navier–Stokes equations are decomposed into anisotropic and isotropic turbulent components and corresponding radiating waves. An analytical solution is proposed for the radiating waves associated with isotropic turbulence that contains arguments involving the vector Green’s function of the Navier–Stokes equations and the multi-order two-point cross-correlation of the Navier–Stokes equations involving turbulent fluctuations. Using the theory of isotropic turbulence, the two-point cross-correlation of the Navier–Stokes equations is written as a vector-normalized, two-point cross-correlation multiplied by corresponding wave-number spectra of the structure functions. Composite structure functions of the field variables are adapted from canonical theory of isotropic turbulence. The vector-normalized two-point cross-correlation involves arguments of separation distance, wave number, and corresponding turbulent length and time scales. A solution of the vector Green’s function of the linearized Navier–Stokes equation for acoustic pressure is derived. A simple system of differential and algebraic equations is proposed to model the statistics of stationary and decaying isotropic turbulence, which are arguments of the model equation. Predictions of acoustic and turbulent statistics are compared with a wide variety of measurements and direct numerical simulations from various sources over a range of Reynolds numbers and initial scales. Predictions compare favorably with previous theories, direct numerical simulations, and measurements.",55,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055104,"The aeroacoustic noise of a simplified wing-flap configuration placed in an open-jet anechoic wind tunnel is investigated by compressible wall-resolved large-eddy simulations possibly coupled with the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings acoustic analogy. The numerical domain includes the nozzle and the anechoic chamber, which allows the direct taking of the installation effects into account. The simulated span (25% of the flap chord) is the largest one simulated so far for this configuration and, more generally, at this high Reynolds number. The results of the simulation are validated with the extensive experimental database for the chosen configuration. A good overall agreement with experimental data is achieved for all mean and fluctuating velocities, as well as wall pressures on the wing and the flap, especially the power spectral densities, the convection velocities, and even the streamwise and spanwise coherences on both elements. Similar good predictions of the far-field acoustic pressure using a hybrid approach are achieved, although the acoustic analogy does not allow taking into account the jet noise given that the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings surfaces are placed within the jet core. The acoustic results obtained with the acoustic analogy are also compared with the numerical microphones placed in the far field, showing a good agreement up to the mesh cut-ff frequency. The dilatation field and the sound directivity stress that the flap and wing trailing edges are the dominant noise sources of the wing-flap configuration, with significant diffraction effects on the flap side. Evidence of slight boundary-layer instabilities is also shown close to the flap trailing edge.",55,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055337,"The present work proposes and assesses a methodology based on incompressible computational fluid dynamics simulations to study the acoustic behavior of Helmholtz resonators under a large range of excitation amplitudes. It constitutes an alternative approach to the more widespread one based on compressible flow simulations to analyze the nonlinear regime of Helmholtz resonators. In the present methodology, the resonator is decomposed into its two main components: an assumed incompressible orifice neck and a compressible backing volume. The transfer impedance of the single orifice is obtained by means of an incompressible solver of the flow equations without turbulence modeling, whereas an analytical model accounts for the compliance of the gas in the backing cavity. The proposed methodology is compared for validation purposes to both numerical results of the full compressible equations and experimental data for the complete resonator at different sound pressure levels. A good agreement between the results of the two numerical approaches could be achieved. Numerical results match also fairly well with experimental data, but a systematic overprediction of the resistance by simulations is observed. Accounting for the presence of microrounded edges, presumably present due to manufacturing processes, allows a better agreement between numerical and experimental results.",55,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055280,"A controlled, laser-generated perturbation was created in the freestream of the Boeing/U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel. The freestream perturbation convected downstream in the wind tunnel to interact with a flared cone model. The model is a body of revolution bounded by a circular arc with a 3.0 m radius. Two different nose tips were used in this experiment: a 1.0 mm nose tip and a 0.16 mm nose tip. Fourteen fast pressure transducers were used to measure a wave packet generated in the cone boundary layer by the freestream perturbation. This wave packet grew large and became nonlinear before experiencing natural transition in quiet flow. Breakdown of this wave packet occurred when the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations at the most unstable second-mode frequency was approximately 10% of the surface pressure for a nominally sharp nose tip. The amplitude of the second-mode instability at the neutral point on the flared cone is estimated to be on the order of times the surface pressure for the 1.0 mm nose tip and times the surface pressure for the 0.16 mm nose tip.",55,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055341,"An array of NASA-designed diamond-shaped trips was employed to induce transition of a low-Reynolds-number Mach 5.65 laminar boundary layer. The purpose was to quantify the flow structure of a low-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer that was accessible to high-fidelity numerical simulation. The transition process and subsequent turbulent boundary layer were experimentally examined using hot-wire anemometry, pitot pressure probes, schlieren photography, and surface oilflow visualization. Downstream of the trips, peak disturbances near the boundary-layer edge were observed to grow in amplitude in the axial direction. By the aft measurement location , the energy was distributed across the boundary layer, indicating breakdown to turbulence. A spectral peak near 58 kHz was observed in the tripped flows at all measurement locations, which indicated the presence of Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities. Compressibility scaling of the velocity was found to collapse the sub- and log-layer region data with expected theory. When the turbulent boundary-layer power spectra were analyzed, the decay was found to follow the Kolmogorov power law. Conversely, it was expected that the turbulence production and viscous dissipation balance was not fully established.",55,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055319,"The placement of a flow control device is highly dependent on the designers’ experience and their view of the area where the device will be most effective. In this paper, the mesh adjoint approach is proposed to help the designer to identify the regions where drag is most sensitive to a change of the surface of a transonic wing and to assess the success of an optimization. An array of shock control bumps are deployed in the areas of high sensitivity and optimized using a gradient-based approach. In addition to the sensitivity in the shock regions, a nonshock region is also identified using the sensitivity map on the wing. This region is not apparent from surface flow properties, such as pressure or skin friction, and could be overlooked by a designer without the sensitivity map. The results show that the mesh adjoint approach successfully identifies drag sensitive areas on the wing and assists in the deployment of the bump arrays. The bumps are parameterized using class/shape function transformation, which provides a highly flexible design space, with a large number of design variables, to achieve an optimal solution.",55,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055194,"The separation length is an important parameter of transverse jet interaction, which is related to the interaction force, moment, and heating effect. Two-dimensional sonic injection normal to high-speed flow with a turbulent boundary layer is numerically investigated, and the upstream separation length is theoretically predicted. Present numerical study indicates that the separation length is constant as the Mach number increases when the unit Reynolds number is fixed at a range of to for the Mach number greater than 3.50 and smaller than 6.50. Results also indicate that the separation length increases with increasing pressure ratio or increasing slot width as well as decreasing Reynolds number. Based on the high Mach number independence of the separation length and effects of other parameters on the separation length, a combination parameter is proposed and then a theoretical model for the separation length is established. This model can be applied to a wide range of pressure ratios, Reynolds numbers, slot widths, and Mach numbers when the Mach number is greater than 3.50. Upstream separation lengths predicted by the present model are compared with experimental and numerical results, as well as results by the existing model. Results show that separation lengths predicted by the present model agree well with experimental and numerical studies.",55,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055286,"Flow-separation control on an adverse-pressure-gradient ramp model was investigated using various flow-control methods in the NASA Langley Research Center’s 15 in. wind tunnel. Sweeping jet actuators were compared to more classic flow-control techniques such as microvortex generators, steady blowing, and steady and unsteady vortex-generating jets. Surface pressure measurements and an improved oilflow visualization technique were used to characterize the effectiveness of these flow-control techniques in this research. The results showed that the vortex-generating jet using circular round orifices provided similar performance to the oscillating jets, which was mainly attributed to the larger skew angle of the circular round orifices compared to the current sweeping jet actuator configuration. However, a more direct comparison was made possible by operating the sweeping jet actuators in three different modes to produce steady-straight, steady-angled, and unsteady-oscillating jets. It was found that the steady-straight jet was the least effective method for a fixed momentum coefficient. The steady-angled jet achieved better control performance than the steady-straight jet, which was attributed to the generation of streamwise vortices that energized the boundary layer by mixing high-momentum fluid with near-wall low-momentum fluid. The unsteady-oscillating jet achieved the best performance by increasing the pressure recovery and reducing the downstream flow separation.",55,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055169,"Shock control bumps offer the potential to reduce wave drag on transonic aircraft wings. However, most studies to date have only considered unswept flow conditions, leaving uncertain their applicability to realistic finite swept wings. This paper uses a swept infinite-wing model as an intermediate step, and it presents a computational study of the design drag performance of three-dimensional bumps. A new geometric parameter, termed bump orientation, is introduced and found to be crucial to the performance under swept flows. Classic shock control bumps aligned approximately with the local to freestream flow direction can offer drag reductions comparable to those from similar but unoriented devices in unswept flows, whereas badly misaligned bumps see severe performance degradation. For appropriately aligned classic bumps, the relationships between performance and selected geometric parameters (height, streamwise position, and isolation) are found to be somewhat similar to those observed in unswept studies.",55,3

The measurements comprise the dynamic pressure distribution at the cone surface, the reservoir pressure, and the overall mass flow rate. Material permeability depending on fiber orientation is measured on cylindrical samples. Furthermore, a numerical approach with the two-dimensional Darcy equation is presented to simulate the pressure loss across the orthotropic wall structure and the mass flow distribution along the surface. Finally, the results from the experiment and the simulation are compared and assessed with respect to the fiber orientation of the material. The resulting mass flow distributions demonstrate the flow dependence on the fiber orientation. Furthermore, the outflow behavior at the surface is investigated, focusing on the exhaust angle, and the results of the measurements coincide with the simulations. However, dependence on wall thickness is seen in simulations but not in measurements.",55,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055064,"In this paper, supersonic indicial pressure loads on a finite length planar surface (like those of an airfoil) subject to a strong crossflow, as caused by a gust or a sudden change of angle of attack, are studied. The unsteady pressure and force are obtained by an extension of linear theory, accounting for the nonlinear effects of shock waves on a windward surface and rarefaction waves on a leeward surface. Notably, the pressure in the nonuniform region (secondary wave) caused by interaction of the front and rear parts of the shock or rarefaction wave is assumed to be geometrically similar to that given by linear theory. The indicial force is expressed as an algebraic function of the edges of the secondary wave and pressure coefficients of uniform regions. The flow around a flat plate with a sudden change of angle of attack is used as a test case. By using a numerical simulation for comparison, it is shown that the modified theory increases the accuracy significantly at a large angle of attack, whereas the linear theory only works for very small angle of attack. When the constancy of the initial segment of the force curve, which is a phenomenon observed by numerical simulation, is used to correct the modified theory further, an extended model is obtained that is quantitatively correct, even for very a large angle of attack. The present nonlinear extension provides a clear and understandable description of the flow physics.",55,3

The instability of liquid fuel flow by perturbation of gas oxidizer flow in gas-centered swirl coaxial injectors is investigated using air and water. Gas perturbation is generated by a speaker, and variation in the film thickness at the end of the injector is measured. The spray patterns have different shapes, depending on the excitation frequency. The excitation effect is enhanced by the increment of the momentum flux ratio. Different gain values are achieved according to the input frequency, and a high value is realized in both low and high frequencies.

In this study, a boundary-layer model was used to confirm the link between predicted incident-shock boundary-layer growth and postreflected-shock pressure rise in shock tubes for a wide variety of nonreacting mixture compositions and experimental conditions. The results show that boundary-layer growth and, consequently, postreflected-shock pressure rise are strongly affected by the incident-shock Mach number and specific heat ratio of the mixture. In this study, mixtures of Ar, , and were examined at experimental conditions of approximately 1400–1800 K at an average pressure of 1.73 atm. Although each mixture (with differing ) experienced the same range of postreflected-shock conditions ( and ), the Mach number span for each mixture was different. This Mach number byproduct of matching and for each mixture was a major cause of differences in boundary-layer growth behavior and resulting postreflected-shock pressure rise, with the -laden mixture producing the largest postshock pressure (and temperature) rise. Additionally, the measured pressure rise for the high--content mixtures was an order of magnitude greater than for mixtures of pure Ar at the same experimental ( and ) conditions.",55,3

Gaseous ethylene fuel is injected into the combustor through a supersonic nozzle, and is autoignited by high-enthalpy flows that are compressed and decelerated by a train of shock waves through the scramjet isolator/combustor. The turbulence level of the freestream is manipulated to investigate the influence of freestream turbulence on the flame dynamics in the supersonic combustor. General flame behavior is observed in time-averaged ethylene-flame-chemiluminescence images, whereas the detailed turbulent flame structures are resolved by imaging instantaneous ground-state hydroxyl radical (OH) distributions using the planar-laser-induced-fluorescence technique, wherein a planar laser sheet is projected into the scramjet in the counterstreamwise direction to illuminate the entire internal flow region, including the isolator and supersonic combustor of the model scramjet.

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055276,"A new method is proposed for calculations of rare-event rocket combustion instabilities. Acceleration of the combustion chamber is modeled as a stochastic process of long duration and moderate amplitude. Using a simplified model for the effect of acceleration on the evolution of the first tangential mode of pressure within the chamber, a modified sampling distribution is obtained that yields higher occurrence of the rare event: in this case, growth to instability. Statistics are then calculated for the original distribution of the stochastic process using an importance sampling procedure. Knowledge of the likelihood ratios between the real and modified probability density functions allows a low-cost computation of the probability of the rare event of triggering the combustion instability by low-amplitude acceleration fluctuations. There are two distinct regimes of high and low probabilities of triggering, with a critical acceleration amplitude threshold between them; in the low-probability regime, the probability of triggering increases exponentially with increasing acceleration amplitude. The probability of triggering increases with increasing duration of the stochastic acceleration. This method of low-probability event analysis can be extended to other instability-triggering mechanisms.",55,3

This paper uses the concept of a dynamic Bayesian network to build a versatile probabilistic model for diagnosis and prognosis in order to realize the digital twin vision, and it illustrates the proposed method by an aircraft wing fatigue crack growth example. The dynamic Bayesian network integrates physics models and various aleatory (random) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainty sources in crack growth prediction. In diagnosis, the dynamic Bayesian network is used to track the evolution of the time-dependent variables and calibrate the time-independent variables; in prognosis, the dynamic Bayesian network is used for probabilistic prediction of crack growth in the future. This paper also proposes a modification to the dynamic Bayesian network structure, which does not affect the diagnosis results but reduces the time cost significantly by avoiding Bayesian updating with load data. By using a particle filter as the Bayesian inference algorithm for the dynamic Bayesian network, the proposed approach handles both discrete and continuous variables of various distribution types, as well as nonlinear relationships between nodes.

The present method models the plate and the stiffener separately, which allows the stiffener element nodes to not coincide with the plate shell-element nodes. The stiffness and mass matrices of a stiffener are transformed to those of the plate through the displacement compatibility conditions at the plate–stiffener interface via finite element interpolation. Convergence and validation studies have been conducted to verify the present method in the finite element vibration analysis by using the examples from the existing literature. Prestressed vibration mode results are examined for a stiffened composite panel with arbitrarily shaped composite stiffeners in the presence of the in-plane normal and shear loads. Numerical results show the possible benefits of using curvilinear stiffeners to improve the vibration response by increasing both the fundamental frequency and the buckling load through changing the vibration and buckling mode shapes with a negligible or even no weight penalty. The stiffener depth ratio is found to increase both the fundamental frequency and the buckling load, but only up to a certain value. Any further increase in the stiffener depth ratio causes stiffener buckling before plate buckling, and it leads the free and prestressed vibration mode results to behave as the vibration mode results for a plate with simply supported boundary conditions along the stiffeners.",55,3

Based on the ground structure approach, discrete variables (0, 1) representing the absence or presence of beam members and continuous sizing variables for beam cross sections are involved in the problem. A two-level multipoint approximation strategy is introduced to address this mixed-variable problem. A first-level approximate problem is first constructed using the branched multipoint approximate function involving both discrete and continuous variables. For solving this problem, discrete variables are optimized through a genetic algorithm, and when calculating the fitness in the genetic algorithm, a second-level approximate problem solved by the dual method is established to optimize the cross sections for the retained beam members. Temporal deletion techniques are used for displacement and stress constraints. Meanwhile, by considering local vibration modes in frequency-constrained problems, material density is assigned with an extremely small value for the removed beams to avoid these local modes. Thence, the singularities encountered in stress, displacement, and frequency constraints are overcome. Typical examples and a satellite application are given to verify the feasibility and efficiency of this method in handling the integrated topology and sizing optimization for frame structures.",55,3
