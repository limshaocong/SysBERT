0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058248,"A simple, robust, and efficient procedure to accelerate multigrid algorithms is discussed in detail. The approach used in this study is based on the BoostConv routine recently proposed by Citro et al. (“Efficient Stabilization and Acceleration of Numerical Simulation of Fluid Flows by Residual Recombination,” Journal of Computational Physics, Vol. 344, 2017, pp. 234–246). The present study starts from the idea that an existing multigrid code can be improved without any coding effort: a simple call to a black-box subroutine is enough to accelerate the iterative procedure. As a consequence, the proposed approach is well suited to be applied in real-life applications where the complexity of numerical codes is quite far from textbook standards. The application of BoostConv to a model problem is presented here. The algorithm is able to reduce the number of iterations required to get the target accuracy without increasing the computational time of the original code. As a consequence, BoostConv can be used on simple models, characterized by few degrees of freedom, or large numerical problems arising from the discretization of three-dimensional problems.",57,6

Despite advances in (Reynolds-averaged) Navier–Stokes equations solvers and models, it is arguably the first choice for preliminary and even detailed design. A new method of coupling the boundary-layer equations to the inviscid flow is presented. The boundary-layer equations are solved with given displacement thickness, and a Newton method couples the viscous and inviscid regimes. This leads to a significant decrease in computational effort as compared to a joint solution of the boundary-layer equations with the coupling problem. The software Viiflow uses this mechanism, and examples that couple the integral boundary-layer equations with a panel method are presented: assessing accuracy using wind-tunnel measurements, using the software for a fluid–structure interaction problem, and a runtime performance comparison demonstrating a significant improvement as compared to the popular viscous–inviscid interaction airfoil analysis software XFOIL for higher numbers of panels.",57,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058360,"This paper presents a direct numerical simulation dataset comprising four transcritical nitrogen jets characterized by the same Reynolds number and different pressures, ranging from near critical up to largely supercritical. Simulations are carried out using a well-established high-order numerical method in conjunction with high-fidelity real fluid equation of state and transport properties. Although being characterized by the same Reynolds number, jets under transcritical conditions at different pressures behave in a significantly different way at both large- and small-scale. At near-critical pressure conditions, jets are more influenced by the solid wall effect caused by the steep stratification induced by the pseudo-boiling region. Globally, such gradients delay the complete mixing of the jet, whereas locally they promote baroclinic vorticity generation.",57,6

It is shown that the growth rate of the first mode is increased as UAC admittance phase varies from to , whereas the second mode is amplified when tends to and damped if . The frequency range of the first mode is broadened when is in the vicinity of , and the second mode shifts to low frequencies when . Moreover, the stabilization or destabilization effects on Mack modes, frequency band broadening, and frequency shifting are promoted by large UAC admittance magnitudes. Based on the requirements of the admittance phase and magnitude for the stabilization of Mack modes, a design strategy for UAC is proposed to stabilize the second mode in a wide frequency range with the first mode little amplified.",57,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057913,"In this paper, the authors propose a dynamical data-driven prediction framework to estimate a system’s behavior multiple steps ahead. The main contribution of this work is in the construction of a new recursive multi-input/multi-output (REC-MIMO) strategy, which can attain real-time estimation through a combination of expensive simulation data (offline) and sensor measurements (online). This framework is composed of an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, a multi-input/multi-output strategy is employed for constructing a predictive model for the system’s dynamical responses from simulation data. The offline phase is accomplished through a combination of proper orthogonal decomposition and Gaussian process. By using the measurement data collected from sensors, a recursive strategy is used to iteratively enhance multi-step-ahead predictions by using a new reduced-order particle filter method during the online phase. An illustrative example involving aeroelastic responses of a joined-wing SensorCraft is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. It has been shown that state predictions obtained through the REC-MIMO strategy have accuracy comparable to those obtained from high-fidelity simulations with significant reduction in computational expense. It is envisioned that the proposed methodology can be used to support system decision making in an efficient manner.",57,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057527,"New aerospace aerodynamic bodies increasingly require robust design methods that demand data of the key problem variables in the presence of uncertainty. When these bodies are subject to complex physics, such as turbulence, separation, or secondary flows, the uncertainty data become more difficult to produce economically. Metamodels (surrogate models) can be used to produce data in the presence of uncertainty more efficiently by propagating the uncertainty from the model parameters to the outputs. However, the chief difficulty of metamodels is in consistently producing statistical data of the full system from a sparse number of evaluations. Recently, the polynomial chaos and kriging metamodeling approaches have been combined to take advantage of both their benefits. This research explores the combined method’s effectiveness on airfoil and aircraft engine nacelle examples. It demonstrates that, although the combined method can produce more accurate results than either method alone, there is always a compromise between accuracy and efficiency.",57,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057791,"This paper presents a structure-exploiting nonlinear model reduction method for systems with general nonlinearities. First, the nonlinear model is lifted to a model with more structure via variable transformations and the introduction of auxiliary variables. The lifted model is equivalent to the original model; it uses a change of variables but introduces no approximations. When discretized, the lifted model yields a polynomial system of either ordinary differential equations or differential-algebraic equations, depending on the problem and lifting transformation. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied to the lifted models, yielding a reduced-order model for which all reduced-order operators can be precomputed. Thus, a key benefit of the approach is that there is no need for additional approximations of nonlinear terms, which is in contrast with existing nonlinear model reduction methods requiring sparse sampling or hyper-reduction. Application of the lifting and POD model reduction to the FitzHugh–Nagumo benchmark problem and to a tubular reactor model with Arrhenius reaction terms shows that the approach is competitive in terms of reduced model accuracy with state-of-the-art model reduction via POD and discrete empirical interpolation while having the added benefits of opening new pathways for rigorous analysis and input-independent model reduction via the introduction of the lifted problem structure.",57,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058153,"This paper presents a general state-space realization of the unsteady vortex-lattice method together with a bespoke model-order reduction strategy. The aim is to provide a computationally efficient aerodynamic description suitable for integration in aeroelasticity with arbitrary kinematics. The state-space realization is obtained from the linearization (around arbitrary geometries and static loading conditions) of lifting surfaces and their free wakes. All components of the forces are evaluated in the time domain using the Joukowski theorem. Because the wake is also modeled, however, the state-space description has a large number of states. High-order modeling of the apparent mass, projection on low-dimensional degrees of freedom, and balanced residualization are combined to reduce the system dimensionality. A parallelized low-rank square-root algorithm for balancing is also introduced to reduce the computational cost. Numerical investigations on airfoils and cantilever wings linearized around nonzero reference conditions are used to exemplify the approach.",57,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056962,"Active flow control (AFC) was incorporated into the Stability And Control CONfiguration model (SACCON) in order to trim it in pitch. The combination of AFC and traditional control surfaces enables the model to be stable and controllable. The model can be trimmed in pitch, provided that the significance of AFC is considered to be on par with other parameters affecting the aerodynamic characteristics of a wing. The most important outcome of this exercise implies that the traditional boundary-layer approach with inviscidly determined pressure distributions should no longer be used when AFC is to be implemented. This concept is proven by way of examples associated with the SACCON model that can be trimmed either by large deflection of flaps or by AFC. Proper combination of both parameters requires a minimal input of AFC (e.g., two actuators) in conjunction with a small flap deflection. Thus far, an actuator array located near the flap hinge was most effective but this result may not be universal. Tests were carried out at low speeds (i.e., at ) and Reynolds numbers based on the outer panel chord of the model that approached .",57,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057993,"Linear stability behavior of self-similar streamwise corner flows is investigated under the influence of constant wall temperatures and suction rates perpendicular to each wall. For three Mach numbers, 0.1, 0.95, and 1.5, representing subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flow regimes, modes that propagate in the streamwise direction, i.e., with a wave number at the lateral boundaries, are studied first. Then, the influence of and on the stability of oblique modes with is investigated for the transonic flow. It is shown that the effect on the leading viscous mode with is the same for cooling and suction in the case of small variations in temperature and suction relative to the reference flow without control. However, the increase in stability of the inviscid corner modes depends on both the control method and the Mach number. The stability of oblique viscous modes increases as well and it is shown that at the critical point is independent of the wall temperature and the suction rate. In addition, a maximum spanwise wave number is observed for which the most critical viscous mode is still amplified.",57,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057209,"A compensator strategy based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations, aimed to suppress Tollmien–Schlichting waves naturally occurring in low freestream turbulence conditions, is experimentally demonstrated. Experiments have been conducted on a flat-plate geometry under the influence of an externally imposed adverse pressure gradient. A Kalman filter is used to estimate the effect of upstream disturbances based on pressure information from a single wall-embedded microphone. This information is used by the controller to cancel the incoming perturbations using a surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator. The estimates obtained from the Kalman filter are compared with experimental data obtained using particle image velocimetry. It is shown that the Kalman filter is able to estimate the spatiotemporal behavior of the perturbation field even though it relies on a priori assumptions on the upstream disturbance environment. The performance of the controller and its robustness to varying freestream velocities are analyzed in comparison with open-loop continuous forcing. It is shown that the controller is able to additionally reduce the fluctuating pressure power at the most amplified frequencies with more than one order of magnitude and is capable of reducing the standard deviation of the downstream sensor signal between 30 and 60% for a range of offdesign freestream velocities.",57,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057249,"This paper considers transition modeling for the flow over small unmanned aerial vehicles with a span of around 1 m. Such flows are characterized by very low values of turbulence intensity, and the main cause for transition corresponds to flow separation. Four different turbulence models for low-Reynolds-number flow are compared with the experimental data for a NACA 0018 airfoil over a range of two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional (3-D) conditions. The turbulence models under consideration are the shear-stress transport (SST) model with low-Reynolds-number modification, ( SST) model along with its simplified version in the form of the ( SST) model, and model. The NACA 0018 profile is rotated in a flow with a chord-based Reynolds number of at three different rotational speeds between an angle of attack of 0 and 25 deg. Using a curve fitting methodology, an estimate of the results at an infinitesimally slow rotation can be made. Both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations are considered to allow an assessment of the model for predicting steady hysteresis. Furthermore, 3-D computations for an infinite wing are performed to examine the appearance of coherent structures at high angle of attack, namely, stall cells or low-frequency fluctuations.",57,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056828,"Based on the numerical study of the existing model, certain inconsistencies of the model were first allocated. It was found that the second-mode instability dominating the transition process in hypersonic boundary layers was not simulated properly by the model, and a single transport equation for total fluctuating kinetic energy would make the model fail to be self-consistent. To eliminate these discrepancies, a laminar kinetic energy transport equation was developed in terms of local variables. Then, a time scale correction function capable of reproducing the hypersonic transition process dominated by the second-mode instability was constructed. In addition, the transport equation for the intermittency factor, in which the self-consistent production and dissipation terms were constructed, was also revised. On this basis, the transport equations for the laminar kinetic energy and intermittency factor were coupled with the shear stress transport model through the concept of effective turbulent eddy viscosity to form a local-variable-based model for hypersonic boundary layer transition. Finally, hypersonic transition flows over a flat plate and a straight cone are employed to test and verify the model. Numerical results illustrate that both the transition onset and the length of the transition region predicted by the model agree well with the experimental data.",57,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057254,"Distributed actuators are inherently multifunctional because they have the potential to simultaneously contribute to the actuation and load-carrying functions of a system. These characteristics are particularly useful for increasing the performance of compliant-based morphing structures. This paper presents an investigation of the optimal structural parameters of distributed piezoelectric actuators and wing skin on a compliant morphing wing for maximizing the system’s performance. A previous design obtained following a multidisciplinary optimization technique is used as the baseline individual. This investigation focuses on further extending the design space by perturbing the original optimal individual with the goal of maximizing the obtained rolling moment and flutter speed, while minimizing the wing’s mass. A multidisciplinary, multi-objective optimization routine was implemented to identify the ideal actuator width and thickness active-to-substrate ratio. The results show that the performance of the baseline can be significantly improved through width and thickness distribution optimization of the bi-morph piezoelectric actuators. The maximum increase in rolling moment achieved is 27.67% along with a 4.31% mass penalty. When constraining the mass, a potential increase of 25.17% is still possible. Furthermore, flight speed is increased by 83.4%, while maintaining sufficient roll control authority.",57,6
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058145,"The combined effect of an internal slot in an airfoil and transverse leading-edge tubercles on its performance is studied. The internal slot allows flow ventilation from the pressure face to the suction face of the airfoil, effectively delaying flow separation and stall. Previous studies have demonstrated good stall characteristics of airfoils with leading-edge tubercles. It is shown here that the slot results in further improvement of the post-stall performance. The performance characteristics are investigated both numerically and experimentally, with angles of attack in the range of 0°–30° at a chord-Reynolds number of lift and drag coefficients of slotted airfoils with leading-edge tubercles predicted from the computational fluid dynamics study correlate well with the corresponding coefficients determined via experiments. The experimental results show that the lift and drag coefficients of airfoils with leading-edge tubercles are significantly improved for angles of attack exceeding 10° with the inclusion of the internal slot. The slotted airfoil with small leading-edge tubercles outperformed others for angles of attack in the range of 10°–20° with the most improved maximum lift coefficient and maximum lift-to-drag ratio, whereas the slotted airfoil with larger tubercles achieved the best performance for angles of attack in the range of 20°–30°, including more favorable stall characteristics.",57,6
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058011,"This paper presents a combined experimental and computational study of a low-sweep transonic natural laminar flow (NLF) wing with shock-control bumps (SCBs). A transonic NLF wing with a relatively low sweep angle of 20 deg was chosen for this study. To avoid the complexity of the flow introduced by perforated/slotted walls commonly used for transonic wind-tunnel tests for reducing the wall interference, both experimental tests and computational simulations were conducted with solid wind-tunnel wall conditions. This allows for like-to-like validation of the computational simulation. Optimization of the shock-control bumps was first conducted to design the wind-tunnel test model with bumps. Two critical parameters of the three-dimensional SCBs for shock control (i.e., bump crest position and bump height) were optimized in terms of total drag reduction at the given design point in the wind tunnel. We show that the strong shock wave on the low-sweep NLF wing can be effective controlled by well-designed SCBs deployed along the wing span. The optimized SCBs result in 18.5% pressure drag reduction with 5% viscous drag penalty, and the SCBs also bring some benefits at off-design conditions. The wind-tunnel tests include pressure measurement, particle image velocimetry, and temperature-sensitive paint to provide detailed insight into the shock-control flowfield and to validate the computational simulations. Comparisons include surface pressure profile, velocity distribution, and transition location.",57,6
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057938,"The dominant acoustic radiation from turbulent jets has been associated with coherent wave-packet structures in the plume. Jet noise models are therefore often designed using the statistics of decomposed coherent fluctuations, which display wave-packet attributes. In the absence of a universal definition for wave-packet fluctuation components, several approaches have evolved to educe wave packets. These include pressure and velocity variables that are typically processed through azimuthal and/or proper orthogonal decompositions to yield different models. Large-eddy simulation database of a Mach 0.9 jet is used to suggest a unifying candidate field to obtain wave-packet statistics. The statistical properties of this acoustic mode, which comprises the irrotational-isentropic constituent of momentum fluctuations, are tested to show that it properly reproduces wave-packet statistics known to be crucial for acoustic modeling. Compared to raw pressure fluctuations, the acoustic wave packet essentially filters out the high-energy hydrodynamic fluctuations, optimally reconstructs the near- and far-field acoustic radiation, and recovers wave-packet properties with superior spatiotemporal coherence and radiative efficiency. The inherent difference between the acoustic wave packet and the pressure field is related to the distribution of phase speeds of the respective signals. These features of the acoustic mode are then used to generate a two-point wave-packet model for downstream radiation from this jet.",57,6

By using this similarity model, the outer layer profiles are scaled for approximately 70–80% of the boundary layer height. A corresponding similarity model of the far-field sound pressure levels and surface pressure autospectrum was derived. The proposed scaling shows less variability than the canonical trailing-edge noise scaling within a range of the freestream velocity and airfoil’s angle of attack. The scaling of the surface pressure autospectrum reveals that the viscous and inertial time scales are of the same order of magnitude, which suggests strong turbulent dissipation in the separated turbulent boundary layer that results in the steep rolloff of the autospectrum in the midfrequency range.",57,6

(“A New Divergence Free Synthetic Eddy Method for the Reproduction of Inlet Flow Conditions for LES,” Flow, Turbulence and Combustion, Vol. 91, No. 3, 2013, pp. 519–539.), implemented in OpenFOAM® 1606, which preserves the instantaneous fluctuating pressure field in the domain, which is normally lost. Examination of the pressure spectra at various positions normal to the wall is well represented by wall-pressure measurements at all but the highest frequencies examined here. Various spectral peaks corresponding to shear-layer movement, discrete vortex shedding from the step, and numerous shear-layer instabilities are investigated using power and cross-spectral measurements of the fluctuating wall pressures. Convective velocities obtained from the cross-spectral phase indicate that the lowest frequencies convect slowly, whereas the higher frequencies near the measured spectral peaks convect at . There is an increase in convective velocity as the measurement locations are moved farther downstream. Additionally, an increase in peak frequency was found in this examination; however, the increase in convective velocity (approximately equal to 33%) and frequency (approximately equal to 7–11%) calculated at different streamwise positions were not found to be directly proportional, indicating that the increase in peak frequency cannot be solely explained by flow acceleration but that the structures are likely undergoing streamwise or spanwise deformation as well.",57,6

A semi-empirical mathematical model is developed to predict and analyze the acoustic radiation from turbulent boundary layers over porous media. The model is an acoustic analogy that depends on local flowfield statistics. These statistics are calculated through a steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational-fluid-dynamics solver that includes porous material. Acoustic predictions are conducted for four subsonic Mach numbers without a pressure gradient. At each Mach number, four porosities with constant liner depth and porous turbulent length scale are examined along with the nonporous solution. The flowfield is validated through comparison with acoustic measurement. Predictions are conducted to ascertain changes in acoustic radiation with varying porosity. It is found that noise is amplified or reduced in a nonintuitive way with the introduction of porosity, variation of frequency, and increase of Mach number.",57,6

The acoustic models considered predict both near-field and far-field harmonic noise. The implemented models approximate or ignore chordwise noncompactness such that they do not require chordwise aerodynamic data, and therefore do not need to be coupled to a panel or grid-based aerodynamic solver. Each implemented method is compared to 14 test cases originating from nine separate published acoustic experiments. The experimental data considered encapsulate a range of propeller geometries, blade numbers, microphone locations, tip speeds, and forward Mach speeds. The implemented acoustic models demonstrate reasonable agreement with the experimental data, particularly for the prediction of the maximum tonal noise for which Hanson’s model showed the greatest overall accuracy with an average error of 5.9 dB. Using different prediction models based on the freestream velocity reduces the error to 4.7 dB. The presented results suggest that the implemented acoustic methods remain a valuable resource for propeller noise prediction, especially for design and optimization studies, in which a low runtime is important.",57,6

In this work, an analytical model was proposed under an idealized condition, in which an annular stator cascade and a locally reacting liner exist in an infinite duct at the same time, to study the mutual effect between these two techniques. Based on the transfer element method, the system matrix of multi-elements can be established based on the continuity of disturbance pressure and velocity at the interfaces. The acoustic elements for a stator and a liner were established, respectively, by employing the three-dimensional lifting-surface method and the equivalent surface source method, which are both the so-called methods of singularity. The interface matching pattern between adjacent elements was improved in this paper with more physics included, which can also be combined with the numerical methods easier. Because the technologies for fan-noise reduction, which are the swept-and-leaned vanes and acoustic liners in this paper, are both closely related to the modal acoustic field in the duct, the coupling effect can be strong in some conditions. The results showed that the noise reduction gained by these two techniques cannot be superposed simply. They should not be considered isolatedly.

In the high-subsonic regime, the aerodynamic loads acting on the model increase with increasing flow speed and the fluctuation forces increase accordingly. The pitch/yaw directional instability of the model increases in the high-subsonic regime. To solve these problems, the power of the amplifiers and the controlling frequency of an MSBS for a 10 cm low-speed wind tunnel were increased to improve the control system response. A magnetic field was also introduced to compensate for the directional instability of the model by increasing the output of the front drag coil and decreasing that of the rear drag coil.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057811,"To greatly improve the supersonic inlet stability at low cost of structural weight and complexity, a novel buzz suppression strategy based on fixed-geometry air bleed is developed. It is designed to have plenty of narrow flush slots that are widely distributed along the compression surface. Using the natural pressure gradient varying with the terminal shock position, it is capable of creating self-adaptive bypass flow removal upstream of the internal duct. A strong stabilizing effect can be thus automatically produced on the subcritical flowfield by eliminating shock-induced separation and discharging excessively captured airflow. Simultaneously, the undesired air leakage at the critical regime can be naturally restricted to prevent a prohibitive performance penalty during normal operation. To verify the effectiveness, an external-compression inlet model is specially designed and carefully tested at freestream Mach numbers of 2.0 and 2.5 with an almost full exit throttle range considered (0–99.1%). Results indicate that the subcritical stable-flow range is remarkably extended from a throttle threshold of 53.7% to that of 86.4% and 73.7%, respectively, after the usage of the proposed bleed method. Moreover, intense flow instability is totally eliminated, even when the duct exit is almost closed. Further analysis reveals that the bleed flow rate at the near-critical state is not beyond 1% of the inlet flow rate for both freestream conditions. It actually causes no obvious loss of the inlet flow rate. Also, the following total pressure drop and drag increase are below 0.4%. Additionally, the observed unique buzz flow implies that the buzz origin is not necessarily limited to the two known sources, as opposed to the long-established understanding.",57,6

Consequently, the use of continuum methods to numerically simulate such flow conditions is questionable. In this study, the problem of proper assessment of the aerothermodynamic behavior of space launchers operating at high altitudes is analyzed considering Vega in its ascent flight, an actual space launcher that has already performed a number of successful flights. The direct simulation Monte Carlo molecular method is used to carry out the simulations. After a convergence analysis of the adopted numerical approach, a comparison of different air models is presented to highlight the effect of chemical reactions and molecules vibrational excitation. Then, a comparison of the flowfield around the Vega launcher is reported at two altitudes (113 and 127 km), where the third stage of the space launcher is not propelled. The analysis describes the effects of the atmospheric air rarefaction, which has significant repercussions on the bow-shock structure and the drag coefficient.

The VAT laminates can also be used to improve the free vibration response by tailoring the structural elastic stiffness. This paper studies the prestressed vibration response of a stiffened, VAT laminated plate under a uniform end shortening. Because there are both spatially dependent stiffener and fiber path orientations for a stiffened, VAT laminated plate, a separate modeling of the plate and stiffeners is considered. This method avoids placing common nodes at stiffener–plate and stiffener–stiffener interfaces. This allows one to study mesh convergence for the plate and the stiffeners, separately. It also improves the efficiency and robustness of the finite element model. The finite element code based on the present method is verified extensively using examples that are either available in literature or are analyzed using commercial software. Parametric studies show that, depending on the in-plane load and boundary condition, the VAT laminates with linearly varying (LV) fiber paths can increase the prestressed vibration fundamental frequency when compared to the straight fiber path laminates. Optimization studies found that using nonlinearly varying fiber paths, when compared to the LV fiber paths, causes a significant increase in the buckling load but only a slight increase in the case of free or prestressed vibration fundamental frequencies. The VAT laminates appear to mainly tailor the panel’s elastic stiffness for improving the prestressed vibration response for the stiffened plates with clamped edges. However, for the simply supported stiffened plate, the VAT laminates are mainly used to change both the elastic and geometric stiffness matrices for improving the prestressed vibration response.",57,6
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057892,"This paper studies weight minimization of a composite flying-wing aircraft using bioinspired arbitrarily shaped spars and ribs, known as SpaRibs, for the internal structural layout design. A generalized mathematical model is developed to parameterize the shape of SpaRibs using a four-node nonuniform rational basis spline curve. Additionally, for reducing weight, composite structures and lift redistribution using multiple control surfaces are considered. A stacking sequence table is used to parameterize the wing laminate configuration with ply drops for flexible wing design. For the optimization problem including topology as well as discrete and size design variables, a bilevel programming optimization is employed by using a previously developed parallel particle swarm optimization and a gradient-based optimization, respectively, for the upper- and lower-level optimization problems. The upper-level optimization problem is employed to satisfy such design requirements as the flutter constraints for achieving a specific body freedom flutter mode. The lower-level optimization is used to optimize the control surface rotations to minimize the wing root bending moment, which is considered to be a surrogate for wing weight. Different internal structural layouts and flutter constraints are studied for comparison. Optimization studies show that using SpaRibs for aircraft wing box internal structural layout design can reduce the wing weight by 21.8% as compared to the base model and by 7.3% as compared to the wing box with traditional straight spars and ribs. The additional specific flutter result constraints lead to a 4.2% increase in the wing weight for aircraft design with SpaRibs as compared to the one obtained only with the lower bound on the flutter speed.",57,6
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058032,"This paper presents multidimensional finite element models for the analyses of modern helicopter blades. The methodology enables finite elements with different dimensionality to be joined together in a consistent fashion. The formulation exploits the unique feature of a special class of refined beam elements, which have pure displacements as unknowns. This property makes it possible to connect beam and solid elements at node levels without the need for complicated mathematical formulations. Various problems in the modeling of realistic blades can be tackled with ease such as the application of nonclassical constraints. All physical surfaces of the structure can be modeled regardless of which finite element is used for discretizing the blade portion. Thus, three-dimensional stress states can be readily obtained by avoiding further postprocessing operations. The multidimensional models have been verified with experimental results and validated with beam and shell finite element solutions available in the literature by considering tip-swept blades with rectangular cross sections. The methodology has been then applied to a double-swept blade with a realistic profile.",57,6
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058098,"Problems related to mathematical modeling and optimal active control of pretwisted adaptive blade are considered. The blade is modeled as a rotating thin-walled composite beam embedded with anisotropic piezo-composite layers accounting for nonclassical effects, such as transverse shear and warping inhibitions. The linear-quadratic-regulator feedback control strategy is adopted to study the tailoring of piezo-actuators on vibration suppression. Control authority of piezoelectrically induced transverse shear and bending coupling is highlighted. Tailoring studies using the present model reveal that piezoelectrically induced transverse shear plays an important role on control effectiveness. In addition, the relations between the control authority and the elastic couplings, piezoelectrically induced actuation couplings, pretwist angle, and size and position of piezo-actuators are investigated.",57,6
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057866,"The structure-borne tones generated by the main gearbox are the primary components of helicopter interior noise. Recently, a kind of periodic strut has been designed to isolate the multispectral vibration from transmitting to the cabin, for their specific stop-band characteristics. Using multicell optimization, the disorders are designed into the strut to obtain better vibration and noise reduction effect. The dynamic model of the periodic strut is firstly established by combining the spectral element method and the transfer matrix method. On this basis, a multi-objective multivariable genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the geometry by taking the maximum attenuation as the performance objective function. Then, a near-periodic structure is achieved. Compared with the perfect periodic strut, the optimal one has a much wider and deeper stop band, which is critical for a better vibration and noise attenuation effect. In addition, a method is presented to analyze the wave propagation to explore the increase of width and depth of the bandgaps more closely. Experimental investigations are then carried out on a pair of original and optimal struts to validate the improvements. It is shown that 26.22% more attenuation is achieved through this structural optimization.",57,6
