1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052865,"The three-dimensional linear dynamic elasticity problem formulation and solution for a generally asymmetric sandwich plate consisting of core and face sheets that are orthotropic, and subjected to blast loading, is presented. Laplace transforms are used to obtain ordinary differential equations in the complex Laplace space (with the variable being the through-thickness coordinate), which are subsequently solved in closed form for a simply supported plate, with the solution involving a cubic characteristic equation with complex coefficients. Subsequently, the time response is obtained by a numerical inverse Laplace transform by use of the Euler method. A realistic material and blast case is used to demonstrate the transient behavior for the displacements and face sheet/core interfacial transverse normal and shear stresses. The elasticity results are compared with the predictions of the first-order shear deformation plate theory as well as a high-order sandwich panel theory. This dynamic elasticity solution can serve as a benchmark in assessing the accuracy of sandwich-plate theories.",53,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053039,"A one-equation turbulence model is presented. The modeling tries to adopt a more reliable source and less empirical coefficients. The governing equation is the turbulent kinetic energy equation, in which is closed phenomenologically. The stress intensity ratio is calibrated to be a function controlled by the local variables but not a constant 0.3. The extension of the Bradshaw assumption turns out to be of good accuracy, forming a new Reynolds stress constitutive relation. The two model coefficients are both extracted from one slice of the flat-plate boundary layer, yet extensive tests show that the model can significantly improve the precision of prediction for the boundary-layer flows, the adverse pressure gradient, shallow separation, transport effects, and massively separated flows.",53,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053125,"Micro-air-vehicle wing designs often incorporate flexible structures that mimic the skeletal and membrane attributes found in natural flyers. Accurate performance predictions for these wing types require coupling of aerodynamic and structural simulations. Such fluid–structure interaction simulations are often performed using high-fidelity, numerically expensive techniques such as computational fluid dynamics coupled to nonlinear structural finite element analysis. Although the computational cost of conducting many conceptual design trade studies with these methods is prohibitive, simplified approaches may lack sufficient fidelity to provide conceptual design insights. This paper summarizes the development, comparison, and application of an efficient fluid–structure interaction method to simulate flexible-wing performance for rapid conceptual design of micro air vehicles. An advanced potential flow model computes aerodynamic performance, whereas a corotational frame and shell finite element structural model computes wing deflections due to aerodynamic loading. The paper reviews existing computation approaches, then describes the model formulation, aerodynamic load coupling algorithm, comparisons with a higher fidelity method, and aeroelastic results of wing flexibility parametric and optimization studies at chord-Reynolds numbers of about 75,000. For one specific 304.8 mm wingspan planform, carrying a 0.45 kg payload, the studies indicate the optimized flexible wing achieves 7% endurance parameter gain compared with the stiffer baseline wing.",53,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053289,"Numerical simulations are carried out to explore flow control that delays transition generated by excrescence on a platelike geometry in subsonic flow. Both forward-facing and rearward-facing steps of small roughness heights are considered in the simulations. These are representative of joints and other surface imperfections on wing sections that disrupt laminar flow, thereby increasing skin friction and drag. Dielectric barrier discharge plasma-based flow control is employed to delay transition and increase the extent of the laminar flow region. Solutions are obtained to the Navier–Stokes equations, which were augmented by source terms used to characterize the body force imparted by a plasma actuator on the fluid. A simple phenomenological model provided these forces resulting from the electric field generated by the plasma. The numerical method is based upon a high-order numerical scheme and an implicit time-marching approach on overset mesh systems used to describe the steps. Very small-amplitude numerical forcing is applied to generate perturbations, which are amplified by the geometric disturbances and result in transition, similar to the physical situation. Both continuous and pulsed operations of actuators are investigated. Features of the flowfields are described, and comparisons are provided between the baseline and control cases. It is found that use of plasma actuators can maintain laminar flow for the entire length of the computational domain, resulting in a reduction of the integrated drag by up to 70%.",53,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053356,"The inverse eigensensitivity method is one of the most widely used approaches for finite element model updating. One of the requirements for updating using this approach is that the correspondence between the experimental and the analytical modes must be known. However, at times, it may not always be possible to establish with certainty, for some analytical modes, to which experimental modes they correlate or correspond. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such modes cannot be used in the updating process, and this represents a drawback of the inverse eigensensitivity method and other iterative methods based on the modal data. If a finite element model has an excessive modeling error, then the correlated mode pairs may not remain stable during the updating process and may undergo changes. This situation also cannot be handled effectively using the current techniques that implicitly assume stability of the mode pairs. This paper presents a new method, the uncorrelated-modes-driven inverse eigensensitivity method, that allows both the correlated as well as the uncorrelated modes to be used in the updating process and addresses the aforementioned shortcomings. Two numerical studies and an experimental study are presented to show the ability of the proposed method to accurately estimate the updating parameters and identify the correct mode pairs.",53,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053361,"This paper presents the results of large-eddy simulations of a solid rocket booster jet. An inert gas thermodynamically equivalent to the rocket exhaust is injected through the entire nozzle of the booster in the atmosphere at flight conditions of 20 km of altitude. A local time-stepping method via coupling multi-instances of a fluid solver is used to extend the computational domain up to 400 nozzle exit diameters. The mean flow and the turbulence statistics of the resulting supersonic coflowing jet are analyzed. The structure of the flow is identified, and important features show good agreement with other studies. In particular, the potential core length is consistent with previous analysis, whereas in the far field, the decay rate of axial velocity and the jet spreading rate are consistent with those of incompressible coflowing jets. Reynolds stresses profiles and turbulence scales, evaluated via two-point velocity correlations, are coherent with available data from high-speed jets. This study proves that the methodology applied for this single-species jet is efficient and reliable. Therefore, it can be directly used for large-eddy simulations of a booster jet that model the complex chemistry occurring in the plume.",53,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053439,"The physical foundations of unsteady thin-airfoil theory are explored in the general framework of viscous flows. The thin-airfoil lift formula is derived by using the simple lift formula that contains the vortex lift and the lift associated with the fluid acceleration. From a broader perspective, the thin-airfoil lift formula could be applicable even when the flow around an airfoil is moderately separated, from which the classical von Kármán–Sears lift formula can be recovered as a reduced case. The quantitative relationship between boundary layer and lift generation is discussed. Direct numerical simulations of low-Reynolds-number flows over a flapping flat-plate airfoil are conducted to examine the accuracy and limitations of the thin-airfoil lift formula.",53,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053399,"This investigation uses methods based on the Pridmore-Brown and convected Helmholtz equations to study the acoustic behavior of a single-layer, conventional liner fabricated by DLR, German Aerospace Center and tested in the NASA Langley Grazing Flow Impedance Tube. Two key assumptions are explored in this investigation. First, a comparison of results achieved with uniform-flow and shear-flow impedance eduction methods is considered. Second, an approach based on the Prony method is used to extend these methods from single-mode to multimode implementations. In addition, a detailed study into the effects of harmonic distortion on the educed impedance is performed, and the results are used to develop guidelines regarding acceptable levels of harmonic distortion.",53,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053442,"This paper describes an experimental study of the effects of jet heating on broadband shock-associated noise. The noise measurements are supplemented with schlieren flow visualizations that show that the appearance of a Mach disk in the shock cell structure is consistent with the saturation of the broadband shock-associated noise levels for both highly under- and overexpanded jets. The effects of jet heating are then described for the design Mach-number-1.5 nozzle operating at four Mach numbers: two overexpanded ( and 1.4), and two underexpanded ( and 1.9). Total temperature ratios in the range of 1.0 to 2.2 are considered in increments of 0.2. These values are chosen to supplement heated air measurements at higher total temperature ratios (between 1.8 to 3.2) and to examine the effects of low levels of heating. It is shown that the peak broadband shock-associated noise rapidly approaches a saturation value in all cases. In the underexpanded cases, the peak broadband shock-associated noise level decreases with increasing total temperature ratio and the reverse is true for the overexpanded cases. Although the changes are very small, a systematic trend can be observed. The spectral shape of fundamental broadband shock-associated noise is found to be very similar for all the cases considered. An empirical prediction model for the fundamental broadband shock-associated noise is proposed.",53,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053396,"Aeroacoustic simulations are extremely sensitive to numerical errors. To achieve a high order of accuracy, optimized finite difference schemes, such as the well-known dispersion-relation-preservation schemes, and multiblock structured meshes are often used. Challenges appear in communicating the flow information near grid discontinuities between neighboring blocks, and sophisticated interface treatments are required. The characteristic interface condition has been successful in applications in previous publications, and yet limitations exist that are identified in the present study. This paper proposes a new interface treatment based on the analogy between finite difference and finite volume discretizations. One-sided finite difference schemes are used to calculate the spatial derivatives in the normal direction, and the residuals are reconstructed from a finite volume perspective. Applications to several benchmark cases show an encouraging improvement as compared to the previous characteristic interface treatments.",53,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053390,"A micromechanics and structural dynamics analysis of inherent damping exhibited by representative hybrid nanocomposite beams under axial strains is presented. The approximate model is used to assess the potential aeroelastic/aeromechanical stability enhancement of helicopter rotor blades from carbon nanotube matrix inclusions. The matrix/nanoinclusion micromechanics before the occurrence of interfacial slip are based on the Cox model for discontinuous fiber reinforcement, and the frictional energy dissipation is assumed to be proportional to the interfacial shear force where slip has occurred. The validity of the model is established by comparing with experimental measurements of storage and loss moduli for a polymer nanocomposite. The relatively simple model captures the salient features of nanocomposite interfacial slip energy dissipation once uncertainties in fiber orientation and dispersion are accounted for in an approximate manner by using an effective volume fraction. The validated model is then used to calculate damping of the first in-plane bending mode when a beam is subjected to axial strain fields representative of hingeless rotor blades. Results indicate that hybrid nanocomposites with nanoinclusions show significant potential for contributing to future vertical lift capabilities by augmenting rotorcraft aeromechanical stability margins of hingeless/bearingless rotors.",53,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053457,"A methodology is presented for performing numerical aerodynamic shape optimization based on the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. An initial multiblock structured mesh is first fit with B-spline volumes that form the basis for a hybrid mesh movement scheme that is tightly integrated with the geometry parameterization based on B-spline surfaces. The RANS equations and the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model are solved in a fully coupled manner using an efficient parallel Newton–Krylov algorithm with approximate-Schur preconditioning. Gradient evaluations are performed using the discrete-adjoint approach with analytical differentiation of the discrete flow and mesh movement equations. The overall methodology remains robust even in the presence of large shape changes. Several examples of lift-constrained drag minimization are provided, including a study of the common research model wing geometry, a wing–body–tail geometry with a prescribed spanwise load distribution, and a blended-wing–body configuration. An example is provided that demonstrates that a wing optimized based on the Euler equations exhibits substantially inferior performance when subsequently analyzed based on the RANS equations relative to a wing optimized based on the RANS equations.",53,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053459,"Numerical analysis on the instability of liquid/dense fluid films under supercritical operating conditions is performed on methane fuel. A numerical code for compressible fluid flows, accommodated for the van der Waals equation of state, is developed in order to deal with supercritical fluid and dense fluid layers and has shown good convergence, even at a very low-Reynolds-number flow typically seen in actual hybrid rocket engines. A linear instability analysis is conducted and shows that an amplification rate has a peak at a certain wave number of initial perturbations. The perturbation becomes unstable as the Reynolds number and chamber pressure increase, and the instability region of the wave number is enlarged when an acceleration body force in the streamwise direction is imposed. A limit cycle of the amplitude of perturbations is observed at low-Reynolds-number flows, and the instability of dense fluid layers leads to the entrainment phenomena at high-Reynolds-number flows. It is deduced that the perturbation with the peak value of the amplification rate dominates in an actual hybrid rocket engine.",53,6
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053458,"A computational-fluid-dynamics-based waverider design approach is discussed, which can allow arbitrary generating flowfields (for which no analytical solution exists) to be used in waverider design. To validate this design technique, a waverider with a lift-to-drag ratio of 2.62 was designed and optimized using a Mach 3.5 conical flowfield for a series of wind-tunnel experiments. A payload volume constraint was implemented such that an aerodynamically optimized design could be generated that met wind-tunnel installation and model manufacturability requirements. A variety of experiments at both on- and off-design conditions were performed using a blowdown supersonic wind tunnel. Measurements were obtained using a sting balance, pressure-sensitive paint (with an a priori temperature compensation approach), and schlieren and oil-flow visualization. For comparison with the experimental results, computational-fluid-dynamics simulations of the configuration were also performed; the design and aerodynamic coefficients were predicted by the computational fluid dynamics and design code to within 11% of the sting-balance measurements. Additionally, the schlieren and oil-flow visualization results showed the attached shock-wave characteristics and reproduction of the conical generating flowfield by the waverider at on-design conditions. Experiments at Mach 3 and 4 conditions indicated a change in of less than 3% for the waverider tested, and the design also demonstrated a positive for the full angle of attack range tested (from to 8 deg).",53,6
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053465,"Phased array microphone measurements and beamforming technology have been applied in the investigation of counter-rotating open rotors in an attempt to better understand their noise sources. It has already been presented in the literature that the beamforming results of rotating coherent noise sources, typical tonal noise sources for counter-rotating open rotors, will be localized to their respective Mach radii rather than their true noise source locations. Building on these results, the present beamforming investigation provides an approach for identifying tonal and broadband noise sources of counter-rotating open rotors. The methods provide a means for localizing noise sources and identifying noise source mechanisms truly responsible for given components of tonal and broadband noise. Groups of interaction tones that can have the greatest impact on the sound field of counter-rotating open rotors are singled out, and the most dominant noise sources of broadband noise are determined.",53,6
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053464,"This paper proposes a data-driven strategy to assist online rapid decision making for an unmanned aerial vehicle that uses sensed data to estimate its structural state, uses this estimate to update its corresponding flight capabilities, and then dynamically replans its mission accordingly. The approach comprises offline and online computational phases constructed to address the sense–plan–act information flow while avoiding a costly online inference step. During the offline phase, high-fidelity finite element simulations are used to construct reduced-order models and classification criteria: proper orthogonal decomposition approximations and self-organizing maps are combined to realize a fast mapping from measured quantities to system capabilities. During the online phase, the surrogate mapping is employed to directly estimate the vehicle’s evolving structural capability from sensor data. The approach is demonstrated for a test problem of a composite wing panel on an unmanned aerial vehicle that undergoes degradation in structural properties.",53,6
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053467,"Aircraft have evolved into extremely complex systems that require adapted methodologies and tools for an efficient design process. A theoretical formulation based on exergy management is proposed for assessing the aeropropulsive performance of future aircraft configurations. It consists of the combination of a momentum balance and a fluid flow analysis involving the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The exergy supplied by the propulsion system and its partial destruction within the control volume is associated with the aircraft mechanical equilibrium. Characterization of the recoverable mechanical and thermal outflows is made along with the identification of the irreversible phenomena that destroy their work potential. Restriction of the formulation to unpowered configurations yields connections to some well-known far-field drag expressions and shows that their underlying theory can be related to exergy considerations. Because the exergy balance does not rely on the distinction of thrust and drag, it is especially suitable for the performance evaluation of highly integrated aeropropulsive concepts like boundary-layer ingestion.",53,6
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053468,"The effects of Reynolds number, Mach number, and gas species (air and ) on aerodynamic characteristics of a thin flat plate and a NACA 0012-34 airfoil were investigated under low-Reynolds-number ( to ) and high-subsonic-flow ( to 0.6) conditions. In addition to lift and drag measurements by a two-component balance system, the pressure-sensitive paint technique was applied to measure pressure profiles on the model surface. For the flat plate, the Reynolds number moderately affects the lift and drag characteristics because of a simple behavior of the leading-edge separation bubble; the length of the separation bubble increases as the angle of attack increases. By contrast, the Mach number and specific heat ratio contribute little to the aerodynamic performance. For the NACA 0012-34 airfoil, the lift curves are highly dependent on the Reynolds number because of the formation, shift, and burst of the separation bubble, whereas the compressibility affects only the stall characteristics. The specific heat ratio has little effect on the aerodynamic performance. In common for both airfoils, it was observed that the Mach-number effect allows for the delay of a laminar–turbulent transition and reattachment of the separated shear layer.",53,6
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053493,"Unsteady vorticity-dominated flows are prevalent in a wide variety of engineering applications and are particularly challenging to predict efficiently. Perhaps in no other application is this more apparent than rotorcraft, where prediction is complicated by a wide variety of interactional aerodynamics between strong vortical wakes shed from rotating components and various bodies and wings immersed in the flow. While conventional computational fluid dynamics methods are equipped with the modeling capabilities to support these flow behaviors, they are subject to significant numerical diffusion whose practical import is that high computational costs involving large grids, complex adaptation methods, and high interpolation orders are required to produce sufficiently accurate simulations and prevent the artificial diffusion of vortical structures. Hybrid computational fluid dynamics methods that couple a body-fitted solver to a vorticity–velocity method hold considerable promise in alleviating these costs while effectively preserving vorticity. However, several fundamental and long-standing issues identified with vorticity–velocity methods have precluded their wider adoption. Here, the four most prominent concerns are addressed: 1) maintaining a solenoidal vorticity field; 2) supporting a low-dissipation/dispersion scheme on a general multiresolution grid; 3) providing a consistent and efficient implementation of the viscous terms; and 4) properly including the unsteady pressure contributions.",53,6

A. , “ The Q-K Model for Gas Phase Chemical Reaction Rates ,” Physics of Fluids , Vol.  23 , No.  10 , 2011 , Paper 106101 ), an approach known as the quantum-kinetic method has been adopted to describe chemical reactions in a five-species air model using direct simulation Monte Carlo procedures based on microscopic gas information. The quantum-kinetic technique has been implemented within the framework of the dsmcFoam code, a derivative of the open-source computational-fluid-dynamics code OpenFOAM. Results for vibrational relaxation, dissociation, and exchange reaction rates for an adiabatic bath demonstrate the success of the quantum-kinetic model implementation in dsmcFoam when compared with analytical solutions for both inert and reacting conditions. A comparison is also made between the quantum-kinetic and total collision energy chemistry approaches for a hypersonic flow benchmark case.",53,6
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053441,"This paper describes experimental investigations on the effect of large-scale disturbances interacting with the flow around a two-element airfoil. Quasi two-dimensional transversal vortices are created in a closed wind-tunnel test section shortly after the nozzle. Convecting along the test section, these vortices interact with a two-element airfoil in high-lift configuration. Various measurement techniques are used to identify and characterize these complex interactions. The techniques are phase-locked particle image velocimetry, time-resolving five-hole probe, time-resolving static pressure measurements, and time-averaged measurements of the static pressure distribution of the high-lift airfoil. The vortex generation and evolution along the empty wind-tunnel test section is discussed before considering the vortex–airfoil interactions. As a result, the influence of the induced vortices on the time-resolving static pressure along the airfoil surface and the interaction with the airfoil flap flow is described. The findings are linked to flowfield images and the induced flow effects (the circulatory effect and the local velocity effect) are discussed.",53,6
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053452,"The phase difference and spacing distance between two plunging wings in tandem affect the interaction of the vortices between the forewing and hindwing. An experimental study is performed in a low Reynolds number water tunnel to investigate how this interaction changes the mean thrust coefficient and propulsive efficiency. A three-dimensional force sensor and two-dimensional digital particle image velocimetry are used to measure the wing thrust, lift force, and leading edge vortex around the wings. The mean thrust coefficient of the forewing nearly changes sinusoidally with the phase difference in the range of 0–360 deg. The increase in the mean thrust coefficient of the forewing is caused by the leading edge vortex and stagnation region of the hindwing, enhancing the jet velocity behind the forewing and its effective angle of attack. The curve of the mean thrust coefficient of the hindwing has a -shaped bottom. The decrease in the mean thrust coefficient of the hindwing is caused by the vortex shed from the forewing restraining the leading edge vortex formation of the hindwing, reducing its effective angle of attack. The propulsive efficiency of the hindwing shows a large variation range compared to that of the forewing.",53,6
