0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052541,"An experimental investigation of a free-mounted rigid NACA0012 airfoil in pitch–heave is conducted at transitional Reynolds numbers. Previously, small-amplitude self-sustained oscillations in pure pitch were observed for a specific range of Reynolds numbers: . They were attributed to laminar boundary-layer separation, which leads to negative aerodynamic damping at a 0 deg angle of attack. In this phase of the research, the investigation is extended to 2 deg of freedom by enabling the heave motion. Depending on initial conditions, two competing stable limit-cycle oscillations, small and large, are observed. It is determined that the origin of the large-amplitude limit-cycle oscillations is coalescence flutter for which the exponentially growing amplitude is limited by flow separation at large angles of attack. On the other hand, the small-amplitude oscillations are the same laminar separation flutter type as the pitch-only case. For the most part, the heave motion plays no fundamental role in the dynamics, as the amplitude of the pitch oscillations is not drastically affected in comparison with the single-degree-of-freedom pitch-only case nor is the range of Reynolds numbers at which the limit-cycle oscillations are observed. Nonetheless, the heave motion contributes to the net transfer of energy from the flow to the structure, as the mean kinetic energy present in the oscillations is increased significantly compared to the pitch-only case.",52,8

In this paper, the plasma synthetic jet actuator’s operation is numerically modeled. Results of this simplified coupled numerical approach are presented, along with parametric studies that have been performed concerning geometrical and operational criteria, providing insights of its performance. The results of its pulsed mode have been coupled in a computational fluid dynamics solver via source terms, and basic simulations over a flat plate illustrate the main expected effect of the actuator for aerodynamic flow control: the vortices’ generation.",52,8
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052617,"This paper describes the refined modeling of the large torsional deformation of extremely flexible rotor blades with negligible structural stiffness. Equations of motion including flap bending and torsion, specifically tailored toward unconventional blades with a tip mass and experiencing large elastic twist angles, are derived using the extended Hamilton’s principle. In particular, the foreshortening of the twisted blade arising from the trapeze effect (also called bifilar effect) is explicitly included. Quasi-steady aerodynamic forces are calculated using the blade element momentum theory. The nonlinear coupled equations of motion are solved using a finite-element method. The analysis is used to predict the thrust as well as the spanwise distribution of flap bending and twist of an 18-in.-diam rotor with extremely flexible blades rotating at 1200 rpm at various collective pitch angles. These predictions are correlated with the measurement of loads obtained using a load cell, and the measurement of the deformation obtained using a noncontact optical technique called digital image correlation. It is found experimentally and analytically that tip twist angles in the range of 10 to 40 deg, depending on the blade design, are attained. This torsional deformation is dictated by the combined action of the propeller moment and the trapeze effect. A detailed explanation of the contribution of the trapeze effect to the equations of motion is presented, and it is shown that omitting the axial foreshortening due to the trapeze effect leads to a 50% error in the computation of blade-tip twist.",52,8
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052641,"Interest in flapping-wing micro air vehicles has grown in recent years. Considerable research has been invested in the areas of unsteady and low-Reynolds-number aerodynamics as well as techniques to fabricate small-scale prototypes. Control of these vehicles has been less studied, and most control techniques proposed have only been implemented within simulations. In this work, power efficiency versus flapping frequency is studied and shown to be maximized while flapping at the piezo-driven system’s resonance. Then, a resonant flapping control scheme, biharmonic amplitude and bias modulation, was used with prototype hardware to demonstrate closed-loop control of two different constrained configurations. This work is important in the development and understanding of eventual nonconstrained flight-capable flapping-wing micro air vehicles.",52,8
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052647,"Cavities significantly affect the heating of bodies in hypersonic flows. Previous studies have shown that boundary-layer flows can enter the interior of shallow cavities and augment heating. In this study, the three-dimensional flow structure induced by a finite-width rectangular cavity was revealed in compressible Navier–Stokes simulations. A finite-width rectangular cavity was found to encourage downwash into the cavity, and a pair of counter-rotating longitudinal vortices was established in the wake region of the cavity. The downwash draws high-speed boundary-layer flow into the cavity and augments the heating on the cavity floor. The high-speed flow impinges on the cavity endwall and causes local peak heating. Slowly dissipating longitudinal vortices are produced that generate long streaky hot regions in the wake. The heating augmentation induced by deep or narrow cavities is less than in shallow and wide cavities owing to the insignificant amount of high-speed flow entering the cavity.",52,8
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052659,"A new high-order shock-fitting method with thermochemical nonequilibrium and finite-rate chemistry boundary conditions for graphite ablation is presented. The method is suitable for direct numerical simulation of boundary-layer transition in a hypersonic real-gas flow with graphite ablation. The new method is validated by comparison with three computational datasets and one set of experimental data. Direct numerical simulations were run for a 7 deg half-angle blunt cone at Mach 15.99 to find how graphite ablation and thermochemical nonequilibrium affect boundary-layer receptivity and instability. The real-gas simulation is compared with ideal-gas simulations that set their wall temperature and wall blowing from the real-gas simulation. Weak planar fast-acoustic waves in the freestream are used to perturb the steady base flow. A 525 kHz second-mode wave was found to be significantly unstable for the real-gas simulation, whereas in the ideal-gas simulations, no significant flow instability was seen. For the specific flow conditions tested, it was found that real-gas effects significantly destabilize second-mode waves.",52,8
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052673,"A direct numerical simulation framework is developed and validated for investigating a jet-flow configuration in which a short cylindrical nozzle and the acoustic near field are included in the simulation domain. The nozzle flow is modeled by a potential flow core and a developing turbulent wall boundary layer, which is numerically resolved. The setup allows to create well-controlled physical nozzle-exit flow conditions and to examine their impact on near-nozzle flow dynamics, jet-flow development, and the near-field sound. Turbulence at the nozzle inflow is generated by the synthetic-eddy method using flat-plate boundary-layer direct numerical simulation data and imposed softly in a sponge layer. The jet Mach number in the present investigation is , the diameter-based jet Reynolds number is , and the maximum axial rms fluctuations attain 13% at the nozzle exit. The accuracy of the numerical results is checked by varying grid resolution and computational domain size. The rapid flow development in the changeover region from wall turbulence to the turbulent free shear layer within about one nozzle diameter is documented in detail. Near-field sound pressure levels compare favorably with experimental reference data obtained at the much higher Reynolds number of 780,000. This agreement is essentially attributed to a compensation of the effects of Reynolds number and turbulence level on the noise for which an empirical scaling is derived from published data. A brief comparison is also made to the jet sound field arising from a laminar nozzle-exit boundary layer.",52,8
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052640,"A numerical study was undertaken using the commercial computational-fluid-dynamics code to analyze the combustion behavior of a three-dimensional nonuniform-compression scramjet. Work here was inspired by Ferri’s concept of thermal compression and extended this to include the influence of three-dimensional viscous flow phenomena on the combustion behavior. A premixed mixture with an equivalence ratio of 1 was used to eliminate the influence of the fuel-injection method on the combustion characteristics. The freestream properties corresponded to a Mach 10 flight condition that gave a flow enthalpy, total temperature, and total pressure of , 4676 K, and 29 MPa, respectively. The combustion flame was found to propagate throughout the entire bottom wall of the combustor. Three flame propagation processes were identified: three-dimensional flow structures that provide ignition sources within the boundary layer, radical transport within a three-dimensional shock-induced boundary-layer separation, and thermal compression due to combustion within the high compression region. The investigation successfully characterises each individual flame propagation mechanism on the flowfield. The results highlight the closely coupled interaction between the fluid dynamic and combustion processes within a three-dimensional scramjet engine, which offers insight into how these mechanisms can be exploited to provide superior scramjet performance over a range of flight Mach numbers.",52,8
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052676,"In this paper, evidence is presented for the existence of multiple solutions of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with the one-equation Spalart–Allmaras and two-equation Wilcox turbulence models on fixed grids in three dimensions and how they were obtained is described. The two major configurations considered are an “academic” extruded two-dimensional airfoil geometry and the trap wing test case. The observed appearance of the multiple solutions seems to be closely related to smooth body separation (sometimes massive) routinely observed in flows over high-lift configurations, especially near stall angles of attack. The results are obtained and cross-verified with two stabilized finite-element codes (streamwise upwind Petrov–Galerkin), which provide residual converged results for complex flows with second-order discretizations. In the paper, the ways multiple solutions have been obtained are described, including such obvious ones as providing a different initial guess to the steady-state solver as well as somewhat unexpected (in this context) techniques of using implicit residual smoothing while time marching to steady state. The phenomenon of the so-called pseudosolutions is also discussed, which is loosely defined as solutions to the discrete system of equations having “sharp” convergence behavior (sometimes up to six to seven orders of the relative residual reduction), which fail to achieve the stronger, machine-zero convergence criterion. Some numerical observations are also presented on the sensitivity of the obtained multiple solutions to the discretization and grid perturbations.",52,8
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052646,"It has long been thought by many that separated flows violated the assumptions of integral boundary-layer methods coupled to inviscid flow solvers. In this paper, it is shown how to extend the transpiration theory of the equivalent inviscid flow to essentially arbitrary large separation regions. It is shown through computational examples that integral boundary-layer methods can indeed give useful results up to stall in some situations. The limitations of these methods are also discussed and compared to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes methods.",52,8
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052684,"This paper investigates the model reduction, using balanced realizations, of the unsteady aerodynamics of maneuvering flexible aircraft. The aeroelastic response of the vehicle, which may be subject to large wing deformations at trimmed flight, is captured by coupling a displacement-based flexible-body dynamics formulation with an aerodynamic model based on the unsteady vortex lattice method. Consistent linearization of the aeroelastic problem allows the projection of the structural degrees of freedom on a few vibration modes of the unconstrained vehicle but preserves all couplings between the rigid and elastic motions and permits the vehicle flight dynamics to have arbitrarily large angular velocities. The high-order aerodynamic system, which defines the mapping between the small number of generalized coordinates and unsteady aerodynamic loads, is then reduced using the balanced truncation method. Numerical studies on a representative high-altitude, long-endurance aircraft show a very substantial reduction in model size, by up to three orders of magnitude, that leads to model orders (and computational cost) similar to those in conventional frequency-based methods but with higher modeling fidelity to compute maneuver and gust loads. Closed-loop results for a cantilever wing finally demonstrate the application of this approach in the synthesis of a robust stability augmentation system.",52,8
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052674,"A lumped-element mathematical model of the operation of a synthetic jet actuator driven by a thin piezoelectric disk is both analytically and numerically investigated to obtain information about the frequency response of the device. It is shown that the actuator behaves as a two-coupled oscillator system, and simple relationships are given to predict the two peak frequencies, corresponding to the modified Helmholtz and first-mode structural resonance frequencies. The model is validated through experimental tests carried out on three devices having different mechanical and geometrical characteristics, designed primarily to achieve an increasing coupling strength. A strict agreement between overall theoretical scaling laws and numerical computations is also found.",52,8
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052688,"Membrane wings with variable compliance have a great potential to improve the maneuverability and performance of micro air vehicles. Moreover, changes in membrane wing compliance might be used by flying animals, such as bats, to control aerodynamic performance. In this work, the mechanical properties and aerodynamic performance of a low-aspect-ratio membrane wing with variable compliance was characterized. The membrane was made of dielectric material coated with compliant electrodes and supported by a rigid frame. The compliance of the wing was controlled by applying a voltage across a membrane. The wing model was tested in a wind tunnel. It was found that, when a fixed voltage is applied across the wing membrane, the camber increases, accompanied by a small increase in lift. However, lift is significantly increased when the wing is forced with an oscillating field at specific frequencies. In addition, stall is delayed, and for a range of angle of attacks, there is an increase in lift-to-drag ratio. Fluid dynamics measurements are needed to analyze the fluid–membrane interaction.",52,8
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052692,"This study examines the influence of jet temperature on the impinging jet flowfield and compares the effectiveness of microjet control for a Mach 1.5 ideally expanded jet. The tests were performed on a 36.2-mm-diam jet of air, heated to stagnation temperatures up to 1200 K. The jet impinged normally onto a traversable ground plane oriented between 1.5 and 12 throat diameters from the nozzle exit. Findings indicate that the impingement tones persist and generally become more prominent at higher temperatures, and the lift loss levels increase. Microjet injection produced substantial reductions of overall noise levels and considerable lift recovery, although the effectiveness is slightly lower for elevated jet temperatures. In the nozzle-to-ground range resulting in the highest pressure fluctuation levels on the lift plate, reductions reached 9 dB for the 1200 K jet and 10 dB for the cold jet. There was consistent behavior regarding the suppression of near-field and far-field overall sound pressure levels, with maximum reductions for the 811 K jet of 7 and 8 dB, respectively. The lift loss at small nozzle-to-ground distances for elevated jet temperatures increased by up to 30% compared to the cold jet, and microjets were able to reduce lift loss by as much as 34% for the 811 K jet.",52,8
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052696,"A new bilevel optimization strategy for wing design is developed, in which the optimizations of the wing-planform and wing-airfoil shapes are decoupled from each other. The design of the wing-planform shape and the shape of the airfoils in several spanwise positions are considered as the goal of the optimization. In the new approach, the design problem is decomposed into a series of subproblems based on the design variables. The design variables defining the wing-planform shape are optimized in a top-level optimization, and the design variables defining the shape of airfoils in several spanwise positions are optimized in several sublevel optimizations. To take into account the influence of the airfoil shape in a specific spanwise position on the shape of the airfoils in other spanwise positions, a series of design variables are added to the design vector of the top-level optimization. The top-level optimizer is responsible for the consistency of the optimization. Using this approach, the number of design variables in the top-level optimization is reduced; the airfoils in several spanwise positions are optimized in parallel; and, instead of complex three-dimensional aerodynamic and structural solvers, much simpler and faster two-dimensional airfoil analysis tools can be used.",52,8
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052698,"We investigate the application of a temporal spectral viscosity operator to eliminate aliasing errors associated with the high-dimensional harmonic balance technique, which is an efficient method for modeling nonlinear time-periodic problems. Previous studies have shown that aliasing errors resulting from the discrete Fourier transformation may slow down convergence, trigger a nonlinear instability, or lead to nonphysical solutions. A temporal spectral viscosity operator, similar to that used for pseudospectral methods, is introduced. The temporal spectral viscosity is added to the high-frequency modes of the solution to eliminate aliasing errors so as to ensure the convergence to the physical solution. The implementation of the technique is straightforward and can be incorporated into the high-dimensional harmonic balance solver as a matrix product operator. The accuracy and effectiveness of the modified method is demonstrated for different test cases including a Duffing oscillator and unsteady flow about an oscillating circular cylinder. Finally, the temporal spectral viscosity is applied to a turbomachinery aeroelasticity problem to investigate the effect of added dissipation on the accuracy of unsteady solutions.",52,8
