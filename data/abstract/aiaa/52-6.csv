The approach is based on structural finite elements and industry-standard panel or linearized computational-fluid-dynamics-based aerodynamics together with modern control modeling and associated aeroservoelastic analyses in the time and frequency domains. It can be used for all types and sizes of aircraft, from small unmanned aerial vehicles to large transports. The paper presents the following: 1) comprehensive integrated design-oriented analysis and sensitivity analysis, 2) parametric studies to assess the behavior of various representative aeroservoelastic constraints in response to variations of aeroservoelastic design variables, 3) the accuracy of approximations and sensitivities used, 4) design synthesis by nonlinear programming/approximation concepts, and 5) demonstration optimization examples. The methodology presented has the potential to lead to best practices regarding the design of aircraft with aeroservoelastic strain actuation or conventional actuation or combined conventional/strain actuation and to shed light on the tradeoffs involved.",52,6
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051812,"A simple model that describes the nonlinear dynamics of bladed disks due to dry friction exerted in the attachment of the rotor blades with the disk, and the unsteady aerodynamic forces induced by the vibration of aerodynamically unstable airfoils, is presented and analyzed. The analysis is focused on a simplified case whose dynamics is representative of a high aspect ratio low-pressure turbine rotor blade. A parametric study is conducted to understand the dynamics of the the problem for times much longer than the fundamental period of the rotor blades, when the effect of the initial conditions is not relevant and a periodic steady state has been reached. It is concluded that the conjecture that the dynamics of multimode unstable bladed disk, in the absence of external periodic forcing, finally reaches a state in which only a single traveling wave exists is true and that this behavior may be reproduced also using simplified models.",52,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051899,"Wake effects of a horizontal-axis wind-turbine blade on aeroelastic characteristics were investigated under normal operational conditions. A structural analysis was performed employing a nonlinear beam model based on the large deflection beam theory. For inflow analysis on rotor blades, a free-vortex wake method was employed. An advantage of the present approach is its ability to calculate directly the induced velocities from the wake. Also, for the predictions of aerodynamic loads, a fully turbulent flow solution is invoked in FLUENT, where the SST turbulent model of two-dimensional airfoils is adopted for transient analysis. To verify and validate the aerodynamic model for wind turbines, the wake geometry and the aerodynamic coefficients from the present simulation are compared with measurements and numerical results of previous studies. Finally, an analysis of the tightly coupled fluid–structure interaction phenomena of a wind-turbine blade has been carried out to investigate aeroelastic characteristics, such as steady-state blade deflections and dynamic stability. The present results are compared with the numerical results obtained using a uniform inflow model, which clearly confirms the importance of wake effects on the blade aeroelastic characteristics.",52,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052003,"An optimization approach has been developed and applied to a fan stage representative of a modern turbofan engine to achieve novel, realistic, low-interaction-tone noise bypass outlet guide vanes with acceptable mechanical and aerodynamic properties. The incorporation of axial sweep in the design of the bypass stators is used as a passive method to achieve sizeable reductions in the discrete frequency tones generated by the impingement of the fan wakes. The acoustic benefits, mechanical properties, and aerodynamic performance of an unconventional sweep profile of the stator leading edge have been investigated numerically in an optimization framework using a combination of computational fluid dynamics and finite-element methods to solve each part of the problem. The results obtained in two separate optimizations to reduce interaction noise at the noise-critical sideline operating condition are presented and analyzed.",52,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052065,"This paper describes the systematic experimental and computational studies performed to obtain a fundamental understanding of the physics behind the lift and thrust production of a cycloidal rotor (cyclorotor) in forward flight for a unique blade pitching kinematics. The flow curvature effect (virtual camber and incidence due to the curvilinear flow) was identified to be a key factor affecting the lift, thrust, and power of the cyclorotor in forward flight. The experimental study involved systematic testing of a micro air vehicle-scale cyclorotor in an open-jet wind tunnel using a custom built three-component balance. The key parameters varied include rotor chord/radius ratio and blade pitching axis location because these two parameters have a strong impact on flow curvature effects. Because of the virtual camber/incidence effects and the differences in the aerodynamic velocities around the azimuth, the blades produce a small downward lift when they operate in the upper half of the circular trajectory and a large upward lift in the lower half, producing a net lift in the upward direction. The magnitude of this lift depends on the chord/radius ratio and the blade pitching axis location, and the direction of lift depends on the sense of rotation. The positive thrust on the cyclorotor is produced when the blades operate in the rear half of the rotor, while they produce a small negative thrust as they operate in the frontal half. The lift per unit power of the rotor is increased with chord/radius ratio until a of 0.67. Moving the pitching axis location closer to the leading edge also increased the lift producing efficiency of the cyclorotor. It was observed that the optimum chord/radius ratio for maximum thrust per unit power decreased with forward speed. A key conclusion was that the lift producing efficiency (lift per unit power) of the rotor (for a constant thrust) increased with forward speed while the thrust producing efficiency (for a constant lift) decreased with forward speed. This study also disproves the conventional argument that a cyclorotor needs two completely different pitching schedules for efficient hover and forward flight because it is shown that a simple phase shifting of the hover kinematics could result in efficient forward flight kinematics provided the cyclorotor has a high chord/radius ratio.",52,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052077,"In prior work, several authors including the present ones have noted the analogy between the fluid oscillations induced by a bluff body in cross flow (e.g., the classic von Kármán vortex street behind a cylinder) and the flow oscillations often called buffet that occur for flow around wings and airfoils in transonic flow at sufficiently large angles of attack. In the present study, an airfoil in low-speed flow is placed at very high angles of attack and buffet and/or a von Kármán vortex street is indeed found. Of interest is the fact that the required angles of attack at these low speeds are well beyond the angle of attack for the onset of stall. The dependence of the characteristic Strouhal or reduced frequency on angle of attack and flow velocity (Reynolds number) is also determined, as are the peak amplitudes of the oscillating flow. At the large static angles of attack where buffet occurs, the airfoil is oscillated at various frequencies near the buffet frequency and with several amplitudes. Lock-in is found for certain combinations of airfoil oscillation frequencies and amplitudes.",52,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052114,"In order to carry out reliable large-eddy simulation or Helmholtz solver computations in aeronautical combustion chambers, it is crucial to impose the right boundary conditions at both the inlet and outlet of the combustion system. This means providing acoustic boundary impedances that take into account all the stages in compressors and turbines. This study is a follow up of works in which the boundary conditions were derived from the isentropic and isenthalpic linearized Euler equations. Specific terms are added to the quasi-one-dimensional linearized Euler equation in order to account for enthalpy jumps induced by the rotor stages of the compressors and turbines. This system of equations also accounts for the entropy–acoustic coupling because, in addition to the continuity and momentum equations, the entropy equation is also considered. The numerical implementation is validated by comparing the numerical results with analytical solutions in several model problems. The effective impedance of the inlet air circuit of an actual helicopter engine is then computed in order to illustrate the potential of the method as well as the importance of the rotor terms added.",52,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052202,"This paper presents a vibration control strategy based on the passive piezoelectric shunt damping technique for mistuned bladed disks. Resonant shunted piezoelectrics are attached onto the disk surface between adjacent blades to dissipate the mechanical energy. This strategy is of engineering interest because piezoelectric transducers are placed outside of the main stream in turbomachinery. This idea is developed based on a lumped-parameter bladed disk model. Both piezoelectric shunt damping and piezoelectric mistuning are introduced to minimize the blade mistuning effect. First, a tuning design is carried out to damp a specified mode for the tuned bladed disk. When blade mistuning is taken into account, a further vibration reduction is achieved by introducing an optimal piezoelectric mistuning pattern obtained by a genetic algorithm. In reality, the blade mistuning pattern is not constant in the long run. Because of various complexities, a perturbation of the blade mistuning pattern might result. In benefitting from the manageability and controllability of piezoelectric shunt circuits, an adaptive control strategy is developed to adjust the “optimal” piezoelectric mistuning pattern according to the perturbation. Numerical simulation reveals that good performance is achieved in terms of reducing the vibration of slowly time-variant, mistuned bladed disks.",52,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052214,"An experimental study was conducted to investigate the effects of ramp-type vortex generators in a Wheeler doublet configuration, vortex generator jets, and their combination on a supersonic inlet unstart and to achieve active control of inlet unstart. Actuators were placed on the inner side walls of a floor-mounted inlet-isolator model in a Mach 5 flow. Unstart was initiated in the inlet-isolator model by raising a flap at the downstream end of the isolator, which increased the back pressure. The combination of the passive Wheeler doublets and vortex generator jets allowed the isolator’s back pressure to be raised about 32% higher than the maximum mean pressure achieved by the baseline case as well as resulted in a 34% reduction in the isolator rms pressure fluctuations. The Wheeler doublet plus vortex generator jet combination was successful because the presence of the Wheeler doublets mitigated the unstart-inducing effect the vortex generator jets had on the flow, when used separately. Once the Wheeler doublet plus vortex generator jet combination had proven to be the most effective actuator, an unstart detection technique and control logic were developed to form a closed-loop control scheme aimed at preventing unstart. Experimental tests of this closed-loop control system demonstrated successful control of supersonic inlet unstart with about a 50% success rate.",52,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052323,"The paper presents a novel nonlinear reduced-order modeling approach for multi-input/multi-output aerodynamic systems. The nonlinear reduced-order model for an aerodynamic system includes a finite sum of Wiener-type cascade models. The nonlinear reduced-order model approach starts with fitting a Wiener-type cascade path between the inputs and outputs of the aerodynamic system first. Then, the approach computes the outputs of the path and subtracts them from the measured outputs. The second path is then fitted between the inputs and the output residuals. This process is repeated until the residuals contain only noise. To obtain an optimal path at each stage, a novel nonlinear model, a linear dynamic state-space element followed by a single-layer neural network model, is selected as the Wiener-type cascade model. The Wiener-type cascade model can be optimized by using the Levenberg–Marquadt algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed nonlinear reduced-order model in modeling the statically nonlinear and dynamically linearized behavior of a nonlinear aerodynamic system, the unsteady transonic compressible flow over a two-degree-of-freedom wing section with the NACA 64A010 airfoil is presented. The numerical results indicate that the proposed nonlinear reduced-order model can accurately identify the outputs of aerodynamic systems subject to a weak excitation. Then, the nonlinear reduced-order model is applied to the transonic flutter analysis of the Isogai wing model. Compared with the direct computational fluid dynamics and linear reduced-order model, the proposed nonlinear reduced-order model is accurate and efficient for transonic flutter prediction of nonlinear aeroelastic systems.",52,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052365,"The unsteady flowfield about the ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab/Airbus SAS LAGOON two-wheel landing-gear configuration and the associated aerodynamic noise generation are computed using a hybrid approach in which the flowfield is provided by a lattice–Boltzmann simulation, and the noise radiation is computed using the Ffowcs-Williams–Hawkings analogy. A detailed validation study is carried out, following the guidelines of the second AIAA workshop on Benchmark Problems for Airframe Noise Computations and using the complete experimental database for detailed comparisons. The effect of grid resolution on both near- and far-field results is investigated, showing the physical consistency of the numerical model. In addition, an assessment of the numerical prediction is carried out by computing the maximum perceived noise level along a nominal approach trajectory. Finally, an unsteady flow mechanism involving the onset of cavity modes in the two facing rim cavities is analyzed in detail and correlated with the generation of tonal noise components.",52,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052367,"Computer vision methods are proposed for feature extraction of structures of interest in schlieren images. The well studied curvature scale space is used to define features at physically salient points on shock contours. These points can include shock interactions, reflections, standoff distance, etc., and are present in many schlieren data. A challenge in developing methods for feature extraction in schlieren images is the reconciliation of existing techniques with structures of interest to an aerodynamicist. Domain-specific knowledge of physics must be incorporated into the definition and detection phases. Algorithms must be designed such that incorporation of an aerodynamic knowledge base is viable and known location and physically possible structure representations form a knowledge base that provides a unique feature definition and extraction. Model tip location and a shock intersection across several thousand frames in the complex double-cone schlieren sequence are identified, localized, and tracked. From examination of the sequence, the model appears still, and motion of the shock intersect is observed. Through the application of computer vision techniques, model stillness is confirmed, and the extent and pattern of the intersect motion are demonstrated.",52,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J010001,"A general multidisciplinary design problem features coupling and feedback between contributing analyses. This feedback may lead to convergence issues requiring significant iteration to obtain a feasible design. This work casts the multidisciplinary design problem as a dynamical system to leverage the benefits of dynamical systems theory in a new domain. Three areas from dynamical system theory are chosen for investigation: stability analysis, optimal control, and estimation theory. Stability analysis is used to investigate the existence of a solution to the design problem. Optimal control techniques allow the requirements associated with the design to be incorporated into the system and allow for constraints that are functions of both the contributing analysis outputs and input values to be handled simultaneously. Finally, estimation methods are employed to evaluate the robustness of the multidisciplinary design. These three dynamical system techniques are then combined in a methodology for the rapid robust design of linear multidisciplinary systems. The developed robust design methodology allows for uncertainty within the models as well across the parameters of the multidisciplinary problem and shows extensibility to nonlinear systems. Although viewing the multidisciplinary design optimization problem as a dynamical system is natural for designs in which there are contributing analyses defined by dynamic equations, this approach is shown to be applicable to general problems where the contributing analysis output is algebraic. The applicability and performance of the developed technique is demonstrated through linear and nonlinear example problems.",52,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052422,"Enhanced finite elements are elements with an embedded analytical solution that can capture detailed local fields, enabling more efficient mesh independent finite element analysis. In earlier research, this method was applied to adhesively bonded joints. The adherends were modeled as composite Euler–Bernoulli beams, and the adhesive layer was modeled as a bed of linear shear and normal springs. The field equations were derived using the principle of minimum potential energy, and the resulting solutions for the displacement fields were used to generate shape functions and a stiffness matrix for a single bonded joint finite element. In this study, the capability to model large rotations and nonlinear adhesive constitutive behavior is developed, and progressive failure of the adhesive is modeled by remeshing the joint as the adhesive fails. The results obtained using this enhanced joint element are compared with experimental results.",52,6
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052555,"This paper describes an effective method to create a new ideal pressure distribution for designing a three-dimensional natural-laminar-flow wing at high-Reynolds-number conditions to reduce friction drag of a large-size supersonic transport with 300 passengers. This ideal pressure distribution consists of a useful functional form with parameters that are adjusted to be widely applicable to general wing planforms. Furthermore, this research proposes an improvement to the design flow of a conventional computational-fluid-dynamics-based inverse design method developed previously by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency for a natural-laminar-flow wing design. An idealized pressure distribution and its validity to achieve approximately 35% laminar flow region of the wing surface on a cranked arrow type planform are presented at the condition of Mach 2.0 and high Reynolds number of approximately 126 million based on mean aerodynamic chord. A representative cross-sectional shape of the designed wing is introduced as an example, and it is shown that a distinguishing feature is characterized by a smaller curvature near the attachment line. A further ideal pressure distribution for an Ogee-type planform with swept angle varied continuously in spanwise direction is then created as a test case for more complicated planforms.",52,6
