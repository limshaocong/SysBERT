0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057787,"This paper presents the predictions of airfoil turbulent boundary-layer trailing-edge noise using empirical wall-pressure spectrum models. Five empirical wall-pressure spectrum models were used. Input parameters for the wall-pressure spectrum models were obtained using the XFOIL panel code. A diffraction model was used to predict trailing-edge noise based on the empirically determined wall-pressure spectrum. This predictive method provided a fast evaluation of trailing-edge noise for arbitrary airfoil shapes with minimum flow input data. In total, 15 cases, including NACA 0012, DU96-W-180, NACA 64-418, and NACA 64-618 airfoils, were used to validate the trailing-edge noise prediction. Overall, it was found that one recently developed empirical wall-pressure spectrum model, named Lee’s model, provided the closest match with the measurement data. The detailed capabilities and limitations of each empirical wall-pressure spectrum model are discussed in terms of trailing-edge noise predictions.",57,3

When combined with an appropriate model of the system, these sensors can provide vital information about gust disturbance as well as state estimation of an aeroelastic system, both of which are essential for effective vibration suppression control system design. In a typical aeroelastic system undergoing a periodic change in bending and torsion motion, a number of hair sensors can be in turbulent flow regions at any instant, resulting in random vibration response. This paper specifically investigates the effect in aerodynamic parameter prediction when sensor measurements from both laminar and turbulent flow regions are combined. It also investigates the idea of incorporating the sensor signal power along with sensor information to increase the prediction accuracy in such a scenario. The experimental results show that incorporating sensor response from both laminar and turbulent flow regions improves the prediction for the whole operating region containing both positive and negative angle of attack. Moreover, incorporating the signal power further improves the prediction accuracy and precision.",57,3

A new empirical analytical expression is introduced to calculate the plasma density and electron temperature by using a floating double flush-mounted probe. The plasma parameters and are calculated using a new model based on the sheath expansion, which agree well with the measurement of other traditional probes. These results not only indicate that the edge effect area is related to the radius of the probe but also verify that the Sheridan model can be extended to a wide range of radius parameters. This work suggests that the double flush-mounted probe can be accessible in a broad range of plasma parameters and certain complex plasma conditions, such as the reentry plasma sheath.",57,3

The study extends our earlier work of modeling spatially periodic isolated vorticity in the wake of an oscillating airfoil. The present extension of the model is carried out by taking advantage of existing measurements in the unsteady flow of a forced two-stream shear layer. The shear-layer Reynolds number is , based on the velocity difference between the two streams and the streamwise location of the measurements. Single-component laser Doppler velocimetry is used to capture the transverse profiles of the streamwise velocity in the shear layer. Overall, the results show that the model provides good agreement with the experiments. The utility of the model is demonstrated by using it to establish possible physical connections between the flow features and the characteristics of the cross-stream profiles of the root-mean-square streamwise and transverse velocity. The model predictions are also found to exhibit small change with significant reduction in the number of vortex elements, highlighting the efficiency of the model and its potential usability in real-time flow control applications.",57,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056914,"We describe the experimental generation of isolated vortical gusts and the interaction between these gusts and a downstream airfoil at a Reynolds number of 20,000. A standard method of generating a vortical gust has been to rapidly pitch an airfoil. A different approach is presented here: heaving a plate across a tunnel and changing direction rapidly to release a vortex. This method is motivated by the desire to limit a test article’s exposure to the wake of the gust generator by moving it to the side of the tunnel. Two suites of experiments were performed to characterize the performance of the gust generators and to measure the forces on and flow around the downstream airfoil. The novel mechanism allowed for measurement of the resumption of vortex shedding from the downstream airfoil, which was impossible with the pitching generator.",57,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057512,"The simulation of wingtip vortex flows is investigated with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations and scale-resolving simulation (SRS) models. These range from turbulent viscosity and Reynolds-stress model (RSM) RANS closures, to hybrid and bridging SRS methods. The objective of the study was threefold: assess the relevance of replicating the experimental flow conditions, evaluate the numerical requisites of each mathematical model, and determine their modeling accuracy in prediction of a representative wingtip vortex flow. The selected problem is the flow around a NACA 0012 wing at 10 deg of angle of attack and Reynolds number of . The results confirm the relevance of reproducing the experimental flow conditions, in particular at the inlet boundary where the flow is not uniform. For this reason, the evaluation of modeling errors using the available measurements requires the specification of the experimental inlet conditions. On the other hand, the quantification of the modeling error indicates that solely RANS–RSM can achieve an accurate representation of the flow dynamics. Whereas the well-recognized limitations of turbulent viscosity RANS closures to deal with solid-body rotation lead to the overprediction of turbulence and consequent rapid diffusion of the wingtip vortex, the predictive use of SRS methods may reveal excessively complex and demanding.",57,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057420,"The wakes of wishbone, doublet, and ramp-type vortex generators (VGs) were investigated. The VGs were placed in the thin laminar boundary layer of a flat plate at a Reynolds number of 930 based on the freestream velocity and VG height. The turbulence statistics of the wake were measured with high spatial resolution using planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) and stereoscopic PIV. Three-dimensional time-resolved tomographic PIV was also carried out to visualize the evolution of vortices. The fastest recovery of the wake deficit was observed for the wishbone VG. The peak of turbulence production in the wake of the wishbone and doublet VGs had a similar magnitude and was 1.5 times stronger than that of the ramp VG. The hairpin vortices generated by the ramp VG formed the largest percentage of the wake turbulent kinetic energy, and their size is about half of the hairpins produced by the wishbone and doublet VGs. The wishbone and ramp VGs had the best overall performance. The wishbone VG generated the strongest mixing in the wake region, whereas the ramp VG had the smallest drag coefficient. The doublet VG had the weakest overall performance due to low mixing and the largest drag.",57,3

The flow parameters are freestream Mach number and chord Reynolds number . Three cycles of a sinusoidal pitching motion are considered with reduced frequency and minimum and maximum angles of attack of 4 and 22 deg, respectively. Details of the unsteady flow structure are elucidated to provide a model of three-dimensional dynamic stall at higher Reynolds number than previously studied using large-eddy simulation. The initial process involves the upstream movement of transition, the formation of a short laminar separation bubble (LSB), and the emergence of a dynamic stall vortex (DSV) following LSB bursting. The DSV is initially fairly regular in the spanwise direction; however, as it propagates downstream, it is distorted into a -type shape with legs pinned at the wing front corners. A marked kink appears in the DSV core outboard and near the wing surface. This induces a circulatory motion that self-intensifies, leading to the formation of an arch-type vortex. The legs of the arch vortex move downstream and inboard, leaving a distinct imprint on the instantaneous surface pressure. Eventually, through a reconnection process, the arch vortex transforms into a ringlike structure that is shed into the wake. The effect of a simulated endwall is also investigated because this arrangement is used in experiments. It is found that, during the early stages of the DSV, the endwall has no significant impact on the flow structure and loading; however, following the formation of the arch vortex, the presence of the wall has a pronounced effect.",57,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056775,"The presented work provides a technical summary of the fundamental time-resolved properties of a spatially oscillating jet emitted by a fluidic oscillator. The discussion focuses on experiments involving a fluidic oscillator with two feedback channels. Although limited to the fundamental properties, the discussions throughout the paper are frequently directed at the use of fluidic oscillators for flow control applications, which is accompanied by numerous suggestions for future research activities. The internal flow field reveals the oscillation mechanism that is based on flow guided through the feedback channels to feed into a recirculation bubble. The bubble grows and pushes the jet to the opposite side. Scaling parameters are introduced that govern the oscillation frequency for different oscillator sizes and working fluids. The external flow field within a quiescent environment visualizes the jet’s sweeping motion. A head vortex is formed repetitively. The jet’s properties (e.g., jet velocity, jet depth, and entrainment) change throughout one oscillation cycle. The jet velocity decays much more rapidly than for a steady jet, which is accompanied by a significant increase in jet depth. These observations are consistent with the finding that the jet entrainment is at least four times higher than for a steady jet. Furthermore, the jet forces are assessed from the flow field data. When a single oscillating jet interacts with a crossflow over a flat plate, pockets of streamwise vorticity are formed and convected downstream. Depending on Strouhal number, the streamwise vortices alternate gradually or in an almost bi-modal manner.",57,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057894,"This paper proposes an approach to perform the inverse design of airfoils using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The conventional approaches are based on the solution of differential equations, which are either difficult to solve or take a tedious procedure to obtain the solution. As shown in this paper, the deep learning technique can be used effectively to obtain the airfoil shape from the coefficient of pressure distribution. More specifically, the CNN is applied due to its ability to handle any airfoil geometry without the need for complex parametrization. In the training phase, the pressure coefficient distribution is fed as input to the CNN to obtain a prediction model for the airfoil shape. In the testing phase, a new pressure coefficient distribution is given to the CNN model, generating an airfoil shape that is very close to the associated airfoil with an error of less than 2% for most of the cases. An extensive investigation of the effects of various hyperparameters in the CNN architectures is performed. The results show that the CNN method is very efficient in terms of computational time and shows a competitive prediction accuracy. It thus constitutes an attractive new method in the inverse design of airfoils, especially when existing data can be readily exploited.",57,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057294,"The application of gradient-based optimization to wing design could potentially reveal revolutionary new wing concepts. Giving the optimizer the freedom to discover novel wing designs may increase the likelihood of multimodality in the design space. To address this issue, this study investigates the existence and possible sources of multimodality in the aerodynamic shape optimization of a rectangular wing. Our test case, specified by the ADODG Case 6, has a high dimensionality design space and a large degree of flexibility within that design space. Several subproblems of this benchmark test case are studied, and the multimodality introduced by each set of variables is analyzed considering both inviscid and viscous analysis. This methodical approach allows us to isolate a few instances where certain parametrizations create a multimodal design space. However, this study demonstrates that these occurrences of multimodality are due to modeling inaccuracies or can be curbed by the application of practical design constraints. Additionally, it is found that the shape of the optimized wing is highly dependent on the interplay between induced and parasite drag, providing more incentive to consider viscous effects in the analysis. As an example, when minimizing drag with respect to chord distribution, there are multiple local minima at low , but a single global minimum (the elliptical planform) at high . These results will help other researchers avoid some of the pitfalls that could lead to multimodality in wing optimization.",57,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057403,"Spacecraft system design is practically a complex multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problem. Because of the application of high-fidelity simulation models, the massive computational cost of spacecraft MDO problems becomes a bottleneck and challenging problem in engineering practices. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel filter-based sequential radial basis function (FSRBF) method for effectively and efficiently solving spacecraft MDO problems. In FSRBF, to handle expensive constraints, a filter is constructed, augmented, and refined based on the concept of Pareto nondomination, which is then combined with a support vector machine (SVM) to construct the filter-based region of interest (FROI) for sequentially bias sampling. During the optimization process, the expensive multidisciplinary analysis process is approximated by RBF metamodels to reduce the computational cost. The RBF metamodels are gradually updated via consecutively sampling within the FROI, which leads the search to rapidly reach the feasible optimum. A number of numerical benchmark problems are used to demonstrate the desirable performance of the proposed FSRBF compared with several alternative methods. In the end, FSRBF is applied to the design of an all-electric GEO satellite and a small Earth observation satellite to illustrate its capability for real-world spacecraft MDO problems. The results show that FSRBF can successfully obtain feasible solutions to improve the design quality of satellite systems. Moreover, the required computational cost of FSRBF is much lower than that of competitive methods, which illustrates the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed FSRBF for solving spacecraft MDO problems.",57,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057470,"Surrogate models have been developed to infer the response of engineering systems based on scattered tests/simulations. An effective sampling scheme enables surrogates to have a desirable accuracy while balancing the sampling budget. Most sampling methods implicitly assume that all samples have the same cost to produce. In some applications, however, the cost to obtain samples may substantially vary in the input variable space because some configurations are more expensive to test or simulate than others. As an initial effort to incorporate with varying sampling cost, this paper explores an adaptive sampling strategy in which the sampling cost varies (AS-C). The proposed scheme adopts the Gaussian process for design space exploration, which is based on space filling. Two surrogates are constructed: one for the target function (quantity of interest) and the other for the sampling cost. Then a value metric is defined to estimate the uncertainty reduction per cost. A new sample is added per iteration at the point with the maximum value metric. The proposed AS-C is evaluated using 1D and 2D analytical functions. Four different cost functions and 100 sets of initial samples are produced for evaluation. For a fixed sampling budget, the AS-C adds more samples in an inexpensive region and thus provides a better accuracy than the standard adaptive sampling strategy (AS). As a case study, the AS-C is applied to the design space exploration of behavioral emulation (BE). BE is a coarse-grained simulation method, which predicts the runtime of a given simulation using high-performance computing. Because the cost/runtime of BE varies by the orders of magnitude, the AS-C adds many more samples in the inexpensive region and greatly outperforms the AS for a given sampling budget.",57,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057526,"In recent years, much effort has been devoted to find the “optimum impedance” (i.e., the impedance that results in the maximum modal decay rate in flow duct acoustics for a given frequency, Mach number, and azimuthal mode order). Although such analysis can be carried out by means of numerical simulations, analytical expressions can also be derived to predict the optimum impedance. Previous works have been concerned with the optimum impedance of higher-order modes in rectangular ducts with uniform flow. In this work, the analysis is expanded to circular ducts for both uniform and sheared inviscid flows. Focus is given to typical operating conditions found in turbofan engine intakes and vehicle exhaust systems. It is shown that, in certain conditions, the optimum impedance is affected even by the presence of a small boundary-layer thickness. It is also noted that, for low Helmholtz numbers, the optimum impedance may have a negative resistance.",57,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057559,"This paper presents a statistical inference method for impedance eduction in a flow-duct facility. The acoustic impedance is recast into a random variable, and Bayes’s theorem is used to obtain the posterior probability density function of both its real and imaginary parts, thus expressing the knowledge/uncertainty one has on the impedance value, given a certain experimental data uncertainty. An evolutionary Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is selected to explore the probability space, and a surrogate model based on the method of snapshots is employed to speed up the calculations. The linearized Euler equations are solved using a two-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin scheme, accounting for the presence of a grazing flow. The inference process is first validated on published NASA Grazing Incidence Tube results, in which acoustic-pressure measurements on the wall opposite the liner are used as inputs. Then, the same procedure is applied to educe the impedance of a conventional single degree-of-freedom liner in the ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab B2A acoustic bench, in which a laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) technique is used to measure the two components of the acoustic-velocity fields above the liner. The primary conclusion of the study is that the Bayesian inference method allows for consistent impedance eductions, as compared to a classical deterministic eduction approach, for both microphone and LDV measurements. Furthermore, it yields the credibility intervals of the identified impedance, which represent the uncertainty on the identified impedance values, given an uncertain measurement. The identified parameters are less correlated using an LDV-based inference than a microphone-based inference, which might be due to the more limited number of data.",57,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057187,"With the advent of improved computational resources, aerospace design has shifted from a testing-based process to a simulation-driven procedure, wherein uncertainties in design and operating conditions are explicitly accounted for in the design under uncertainty methodology. Key sources of such uncertainties in design are the closure models used to account for fluid turbulence. In spite of their importance, no reliable and extensively tested modules are available to estimate this epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, the EQUiPS uncertainty estimation module, developed for the SU2 computational-fluid-dynamics suite, which focuses on uncertainty due to turbulence models, is outlined. The theoretical foundations underlying this uncertainty estimation and its computational implementation are detailed. Thence, the performance of this module is presented for a range of test cases, including both benchmark problems and flows relevant to aerospace design. Across the range of test cases, the uncertainty estimates of the module were able to account for a significant portion of the discrepancy between Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes predictions and high-fidelity data.",57,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057488,"A novel problem in computational materials modeling is addressed: “Are the computational microstructure reconstruction techniques reliable enough to replace experiments?” Here, “reliable” computations are associated with producing “expected” reconstructions that are adequately close to the experimental data. The output of computational techniques can deviate from the experimental measurements because of the epistemic uncertainties in the algorithms. In this work, an analytical formulation for quantification of epistemic uncertainties in a microstructure reconstruction algorithm based on Markov random field is presented. The method is used to predict the large-scale spatial distribution of a microstructure given an experimental input measured over a small spatial domain. However, small variations are observed on the microstructural features of the synthesized samples due to the Markov random field algorithm. The proposed analytical technique aims to quantify these uncertainties and estimate their propagation to the macroscale material properties to provide a significant understanding on how reliable it is to replace the experiments with the Markov random field model to predict microstructural maps over large spatial domains.",57,3

The ultimate goal is to provide some experience for the extension of this method in three dimensions. In this study, the unsteady momentum and kinetic energy integral equations are solved numerically, together with a set of closure relations based on assumed velocity profiles for laminar and turbulent flows. The robustness of the method is ensured by a finite-volume formulation based on an upwind scheme and a semi-implicit time discretization. Moreover a control method has been developed in order to avoid the Goldstein singularity. The accuracy of the numerical method in the vicinity of the stagnation point is strongly improved by introducing a consistent corrective source term in the right-hand side of the equation system. The chosen closure relations are validated with test cases of self-similar flows. Numerical results are also compared with those of a full Prandtl equations code for NACA0012, GLC305, and MS317 airfoils test cases to demonstrate the capabilities of the method.

The Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with negative Spalart–Allmaras (SA) turbulence model are solved by using GMRES method with LU-SGS preconditioner to improve the convergence and efficiency. A distinguished feature of this implicit method is that the exact Jacobian matrix, derived analytically from the Harten-Lax-van Leer-Contact convective flux accompanied with DDG viscous flux and negative SA turbulence source term with no approximation and simplification, is used for the linear system of equations resulted by the implicit temporal discretization. The robustness of the implicit method is greatly enhanced due to using the exact Jacobian matrix.

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057523,"The treatment of compressible flows subject to periodic disturbances of finite amplitude with nonlinear harmonic (NLH) methods requires a careful choice of averaging procedures and variable sets to average. A judicious choice of averaging procedure for the unsteady Navier–Stokes equations and its associated variable set is one that preserves certain properties of the flow of particular interest and also leads to a simple formulation of the equations governing the time-mean flow. This paper studies the time-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with different averaging procedure and variable set, and presents a new formulation of the NLH method based on Favre averaging of the primitive variable set. The resulting formulation of the time-averaged Navier–Stokes equations has exactly the same form as the steady base flow plus contributions from deterministic fluxes and stresses. Favre averages of the primitive variables preserve the time average of the conserved flow variables. From a practical point of view, this can minimize the modifications to the baseline solver to implement the NLH method. The details of the method are presented, and the method is validated from a two-dimensional transonic diffuser to compressors in subsonic and transonic flow regimes. A good agreement with the unsteady simulations using time marching is observed for all cases.",57,3

Nonlinear numerical dissipation is controlled by dynamically adjusting the cutoff parameter in the TENO weighting strategy according to the first-order smoothness measure of the local flow scales. For the five-point reconstruction, the dissipation bandwidth of the underlying linear scheme is delayed by introducing slight antidissipation at low wave numbers with small dispersion errors. A new sixth-order scale-separation parameter is derived, and the modified TENO5-A scheme is third-order accurate. For the six-point reconstruction, the dispersion and dissipation errors are optimized separately, resulting in a modified fourth-order TENO6-A scheme. All necessary parameters are determined by spectral analyses and are shown to be problem independent by numerical experiments. A set of benchmark cases, including highly compressible gas dynamics and nearly incompressible and compressible turbulence decay, is considered. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both the proposed TENO5-A and TENO6-A schemes show excellent performance for shocks and broadband turbulence. The turbulence statistics obtained with TENO6-A at coarse resolution are comparable to those from the state-of-the-art implicit large-eddy simulation model and agree well with direct numerical simulation data.",57,3

Depending on various geometrical and/or freestream flow conditions, vortex breakdown via secondary instabilities leads to early transition to turbulence. It is desirable, therefore, to reduce vortex energy in an attempt to delay the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and thereby achieve a reduced frictional drag. To this end, a proportional control algorithm was applied, aimed at reducing the wall shear stress and the energy of Görtler vortices evolving in high-speed boundary layers. The active control scheme is based on wall transpiration with sensors placed either in the flow or at the wall. In addition, the effect of wall cooling and heating on Görtler vortices evolving in high-speed boundary layers was evaluated, by reducing or increasing the upstream wall temperature. The numerical results are obtained by solving the full Navier–Stokes equations in generalized curvilinear coordinates, using a high-order numerical algorithm. The results show that the active control based on wall transpiration reduces both the wall shear stress and the energy of the Görtler vortices; the passive control based on wall cooling or heating reduces the wall shear stress, but slightly increases the energy of the vortices in both supersonic and hypersonic regimes.",57,3

Within the presented study the coolant injection conditions, the hot gas conditions, and the coolant gases are varied to determine the influence of different parameters on film cooling behavior. The results indicate that film cooling effectiveness massively depends on the blowing ratio and slot height. Film cooling efficiency is also found to depend on the coolant gas heat capacity, molar mass, and the density and velocity ratio of coolant and hot gas at the point of injection. To compare the experimental data the film cooling efficiencies are calculated using the measured wall heat fluxes and a newly developed, simple approach for the calculation of heat transfer coefficients.

From the measured velocity data, the mean pressure field was computed. The application of different nozzle lengths resulted in flow cases in which the shear layer impinges on the model, on the flow downstream of the model, or intermittently on the model and on the flow. The results showed that, for intermediate nozzle lengths, the overall pressure level downstream of the base decreased in the transonic flow cases and increased in the supersonic flow cases, indicating an entrainment effect in transonic flow and a displacement effect in supersonic flow. An increase in nozzle length was found to lead to a higher local pressure at the nozzle exit, which seemed to result in more overexpanded plumes in the transonic flow cases and less underexpanded plumes in the supersonic flow cases.",57,3

The sources are modeled according to an acoustic analogy. The acoustic-analogy model is informed by high-spatial-resolution two-dimensional two-component particle image velocimetry (PIV) data and solutions to the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations for the reconstruction of the equivalent BBSAN sources. The measurements are of screeching underexpanded jets issuing from a purely converging nozzle at ideally expanded Mach numbers of 1.45 and 1.59. The jet conditions are simulated using a RANS solver with a shear-stress-transport turbulence model. The RANS scales are modeled using formulations of a two-timescale model based on the turbulence dissipation and large-eddy-convection time. The large-eddy-convection-based scale is recommended as a replacement for the standard turbulence-dissipation scale in low-order BBSAN models. The equivalent BBSAN sources are reconstructed from the PIV measurements and RANS solutions at the peak Strouhal number. The equivalent BBSAN sources extracted from the PIV and RANS data are shown to have a favorable agreement.,57,3

Depending on engine placement, the nozzle can become extremely close to the wing-flap geometry, introducing strong installation effects. Two different flap deflections of 8 and 14 deg are contrasted with an isolated round nozzle. A flight stream is applied and an Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) surface placement procedure for installed jets is proposed. Impressive agreement with available experimental data is economically achieved for far-field overall sound pressure level and spectra as well as near-field spectra. The LES provides a wider range of polar and azimuthal angles at 1 deg increments, providing one of the most detailed acoustics data sets to date. The installed cases generate up to 20 dB more noise at mid-low frequencies due to large flap trailing edge sources. Additional sources are introduced by the interaction of the flight stream with the lifting surfaces. Second-order space-time correlations reveal length and time scales in the flow. Fourth-order space-time correlations indicate increasing magnitudes of the dominant noise source components with increasing flap angle.

26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057085,"Measurements of wall pressure fluctuations induced by forward-facing steps with rounded corners immersed in a turbulent boundary layer were performed. Four different roundings of the step corner equal to 0, 6.25, 12.5, and 25% of the step height were considered. The step height was 26.2% of the undisturbed boundary-layer thickness, and the Reynolds number based on step height ranged between 35,000 and 104,000. The results show that both mean and fluctuating pressure upstream of the step remain independent of the corner rounding, whereas they are a strong function of rounding on the downstream surface. The latter was found to be due to a reduction in the spatial extent of the separation bubble with increasing rounding. The fluctuating pressure on the vertical face of the steps was found to increase with increasing corner rounding. For , the pressure spectra within the downstream separation bubble, and sufficiently away from the salient corner, were found to scale on the reattachment length and free-stream velocity. Downstream of the separation bubble, the spectra evolve differently and a separate scaling, one which suggests that the pressure fluctuations evolve independently of the incoming boundary layer, is shown to collapse the spectra.",57,3

29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057224,"This paper extends the use of frequency-domain flow solvers to transonic buffet in turbulent flow regime. To do so, a time-spectral method with frequency adaptation is developed for the simulation of periodic flows of self-induced frequency. The time-spectral method is implemented into a cell-centered finite volume unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) flow solver. This method uses the Fourier series to transform the URANS equations into a steady problem in the frequency domain, for a given frequency. This steady problem is recast in the time domain to allow the use of classic computational fluid dynamics techniques. Because transonic buffet is a self-induced phenomenon of unknown frequency before the computation, two algorithms are implemented in the time-spectral solver to determine its frequency. The first one relies on a gradient-based algorithm to minimize the residual of the system of equations. The second uses the phase shift per iteration of the frequency-domain solution. The accuracy of the time-spectral scheme for turbulent flows is first verified for the simulation of a pitching airfoil with a forced frequency. Then, the efficiency of the frequency-adaptation algorithms is assessed for the case of the laminar vortex shedding of a cylinder. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the solution of the transonic buffet over the OAT15A airfoil, and the results are compared to numerical and experimental results from the literature. It can be concluded that an accurate solution of the transonic buffet can be obtained with as few as five modes.",57,3
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057595,"This study assesses the robustness and efficiency of the enriched piston theory approach for modeling aeroelastic loads in the presence of impinging shocks. Both stationary and oscillating shock impingements are considered in two- and three-dimensional flows, with benchmark solutions provided by Euler and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models. For prescribed surface oscillations, the approach yields good agreement with unsteady computational fluid dynamics. The approach also captures shock-induced limit-cycle oscillations, indicating that the unsteady component of the flow is effectively captured using a quasi-steady, inviscid flow model. The computational cost of enriched piston theory is orders of magnitude less than that required for computational fluid dynamics, making the approach viable for long time record response prediction. However, the results highlight that the accuracy of enriched piston theory degrades for increasing modal activity, which induces unsteady viscous effects not captured by the model. Additionally, the efficacy of the quasi-steady flow assumption in enriched piston theory depends on the ratio of the shock-induced separation length to surface length.",57,3
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057621,"Pursuing an alternative and effective numerical approximate method for structural analysis problems is always a demanding task for aerospace application. A natural element method is described in this paper. This method has the advantage of circumventing the difficulties of the mesh division and mesh dependency problems over existing finite element method methods. It also exhibits an automatic and optimal choice for the shape function and the imposition of essential boundary conditions as compared with other meshless methods, thus making it a robust method for solving mechanics problems such as buckling analysis and the free vibration of composite structures. The critical buckling loads and natural frequencies with their associated modes for several composite plates are determined, and the results are compared to the analytical solutions based on the first-order shear deformation theory. The proposed method is proved to have a good computational accuracy for composite plate analysis with various boundary conditions, thus demonstrating the fitness and flexibility of this approach and a promising perspective for solving structural analysis problems of composite structures.",57,3
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057471,"The present paper deals with a two-stage inverse technique to locate and quantify the delamination damage in composite beams. The first few bending modes are used for damage detection. Initially, the bending mode shapes of the damaged beams are converted to curvature. A gapped smoothing method is applied on the damaged curvature to obtain a damage index, which yields the rough location of the damage along the length of the beam. In the second stage, a unified particle-swarm-optimization-based inverse algorithm is formulated to calculate the size, location, and interface of the damage more accurately by minimizing frequency- and mode-shape-based objective functions. The algorithm detects the single and multiple delaminations accurately, along with the damage interfaces. The results obtained in the experimental investigation of the present method are also mentioned. Overall, the present two-stage method shows good promise in the field of the delamination detection of a composite structure.",57,3

The wing structure is modeled as a geometrically nonlinear composite thin-walled beam incorporating transverse shear strain and warping restraint effects. The anisotropy of the constituent material–induced bending-twist elastic coupling and the heavy external store–caused inertial couplings are accounted as well. The governing equations and the associated boundary conditions are derived via Hamiltons principle. The extended Galerkins method is adopted to semidiscretize the wing-store system, and then the nonlinear analysis is implemented based on the method of multiple scales. Based on the derived amplitude modulation equations under the condition of simultaneous internal and external resonances, steady-state solutions and their stability are critically discussed. Energy flow directions during modal interactions are investigated. In addition, conditions for the occurrence of saturation and jump phenomena are discussed.",57,3
