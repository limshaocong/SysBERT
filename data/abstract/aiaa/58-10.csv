By comparing the modes of highest energies across geometric variations of tailpipe length as well as the presence or absence of a nozzle flare at the exit, we showcase features of notable, but hidden, combustion and fluid dynamic interest that help sustain the cyclic and unsteady operation. Two different vortical systems develop internally. The primary is a strong toroidal vortex caused by rapid reed valves’ closure at the headwall. The second is a shedding vortex, which is seen to tear itself apart from the primary vortex due to the inertia of the incoming fresh reactants. Based on the engine geometry, one of the two is shown to be a considerably stronger dynamic flow feature. In the exhaust, the presence of a diverging nozzle flare causes two distinct starting vortices. When the exhaust is just a straight tube, only one starting vortex is formed. We link this to the fluidic piston effect accompanying the Helmholtz resonance in these devices. Point-source pressure sensors are used to complement the information attained from the video analyses.",58,10
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059444,"A novel approach to reduce the peak lift and pitching moment on a plunging airfoil is investigated through force, moment, and velocity measurements. This approach, unlike previous investigations of delayed flow separation and leading-edge vortex suppression, uses forced separation through deployment of a minitab near the leading edge. The device can be activated for short time intervals during a gust encounter or unsteady maneuver at the expense of short-duration drag increase. Depending on the frequency and the amplitude of the wing motion and the mean angle of attack, roll-up of vorticity and the formation of a vortex can be delayed or even prevented. This change in the vortex dynamics provides effective lift and moment alleviation for post-stall angles of attack and for low reduced frequencies. In contrast, at low angles of attack, the separated shear layer may roll up for the manipulated flow, resulting in vortex shedding, and lift and nosedown pitching moment increase. These two distinct flow regimes cause decreased or increased lift force, with the most effective frequencies scaling with the reduced frequency. In contrast, the borderline between the two regions scales with the Strouhal number based on amplitude and, in particular, with the minimum effective angle of attack during the cycle. The transient response was studied by investigating impulsively started plunging oscillations. During the first cycle, lift reduction is achieved for all frequencies within the range tested.",58,10

In the present investigation, the performance of a high-lift airfoil in Fowler flap and simple flap configurations is enhanced using active aerodynamic flow control. Actuation is applied using a spanwise arrays of fluidically oscillating jets located upstream and downstream of the leading edge of the flap that increase the extent of flow attachment along the surface of the flap at deflections of up to . Actuation leads to significant improvement in the performance of the Fowler flap compared with an optimized baseline configuration ( increased by up to 30%) and enables the high-lift performance of a single-element, simple flap without a cross-stream gap to match or exceed the performance of the optimized baseline Fowler configuration. It is also shown that incorporating a cross-stream gap with the simple flap enables increased lift at reduced actuation levels.",58,10
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059254,"Surrogate-based optimization has been used in aerodynamic shape optimization, but it has been limited due to the curse of dimensionality. Although a large number of variables are required for the shape parameterization, many of the shapes that the parameterization can produce are abnormal and do not add meaningful information to a surrogate model. To improve the efficiency of surrogate-based optimization, recent machine learning techniques are applied in this study to reduce the abnormality of both initial and infill samples. This paper proposes a new sampling method for airfoils and wings, which is based on a deep convolutional generative adversarial network. This network is trained to learn the underlying features among the existing airfoils and is able to generate sample airfoils that are notably more realistic than those generated by other sampling methods. In addition, a discriminative model is developed based on convolutional neural networks. This model detects the geometric abnormality of airfoils or wing sections quickly without using expensive computational fluid dynamic models. These machine learning models are embedded in a surrogate-based aerodynamic optimization framework and perform aerodynamic shape optimization for airfoils and wings. The results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional methods, our proposed models can double the optimization efficiency.",58,10

The system used a dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator as the flow control device, and the experiment was conducted at the chord Reynolds number of . The closed-loop control system selected a nondimensional burst frequency of the actuator by analyzing the time series of the surface pressure data. The neural network of the DQN was sequentially trained at the angles of attack of 12 and 15 deg. As a result, the closed-loop control successfully generated a higher control gain compared with the open-loop control using a fixed burst frequency. Particularly, at 15 deg there was a significant control gain that could not be obtained by the open-loop control. The closed-loop control keeps the flow attached and preserves it for a longer time by periodically switching the actuator on and off.",58,10
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058905,"The present investigation shows that a triad of three vortices is behind the quasi-periodic self-sustained low-frequency flow oscillation phenomenon. Large-eddy simulations are carried out at , , and sixteen angles of attack at near-stall conditions. It is shown that the best description of the underlying mechanism is that of a button whirligig. A globally oscillating flow whirls around the airfoil in the clockwise direction and stores energy in the triad of vortices. When the oscillating flow loses momentum and comes to an equilibrium, the energy stored in the triad of vortices reaches a threshold. Thus, the triad of vortices reverses the direction of rotation of the oscillating flow, gives it a pulse of energy to whirl in the anticlockwise direction, and starts a new disequilibrium. When the oscillating flow rotates in the clockwise direction (in the streamwise direction on the suction surface of the airfoil), it adds momentum to the boundary layer and helps it to remain attached, and vice versa. Consequently, the instantaneous flowfield switches between an attached phase and a separated phase in a periodic manner with some disturbed cycles.",58,10
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059320,"This paper presents the investigation of the starting flow in association with pitch acceleration using transient laminar-flow computation and an unsteady inviscid-flow theory. A thin flat-plate foil pitched at the leading edge is modeled in a two-dimensional incompressible fluid at chord Reynolds numbers of the order of . Several acceleration amplitudes and acceleration durations are maneuvered using a modified canonical kinematic equation at reduced pitch rates from 0.196 to 0.763. Comparisons between computational and theoretical data reveal that the formation of the starting vortex is determined by the acceleration amplitude scaled by the square of the convective time. The corresponding starting force coefficient that scales with the dimensionless acceleration amplitude is proportional to the acceleration angle , which decreases with increasing reduced pitch rate. The starting vortex, once formed at the trailing edge, is shed at the end of the acceleration period. The quasi-steady theory that includes only pitch motion as the strength of the dipolar sheet for apparent-mass flow can also yield an acceptable approximation to capture the apparent-mass force coefficient spike in acceleration.",58,10

It first explores the rich physics associated with these interactions, which show strong flowfield nonlinearities arising from the complex shock–boundary-layer interactions using CFD. In the transonic regime, most linear reduced-order models (ROMs) fail to reconstruct the unsteady global parameters such as the lift, moment, and drag coefficients and the unsteady distributive flow variables such as velocity, pressure, and skin friction coefficients on the airfoil or in the entire computational domain due to the nonlinear shock–gust interaction. As it is well known that a deep-learning framework creates several hypersurfaces to generate a nonlinear functional relationship between the gust or structural input and the unsteady flow variables, an algorithm is proposed to overcome the limitations of linear ROMs. This algorithm consists of two integral steps, namely, a dimensionality reduction where the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method based linear data compression approach is applied and the reduced state is trained using the LSTM based Recurrent Neural Network for the reconstruction of unsteady flow variables. The present work shows its potential for predicting transonic airfoil gust response and the aileron-buzz problem demonstrating several orders of computational benefit as compared to high-fidelity CFD.",58,10

Herein is a contribution to the ongoing discussion that addresses the inherent dynamics near the onset of unsteadiness, complementing experimental data of a large aircraft wing geometry with scale-resolving simulation. Specifically, delayed detached-eddy simulations are performed to reproduce the experiments with a Reynolds number of and a Mach number of 0.801, and they are analyzed using modal methods. Motivated by the recognized difficulty in simulating separating and reattaching shallow shear layers employing such techniques, the impact of two subgrid length-scale definitions are scrutinized. The simulations, using both the standard definition of maximum local spacing and a more recent vorticity-sensitive variant, are validated against experimental data from conventional steady and unsteady instrumentation and dynamic pressure-sensitive paint. Remarkable agreement is found between experiment and simulation when using the vorticity-sensitive definition, whereby dominant modal features extracted from surface pressures show striking similarity in describing localized pockets of shear-layer pulsation synchronized with an outboard-propagating shock oscillation. Identified modes from simulation cover broadband content centered at a Strouhal number of approximately 0.27, which is within the experimental frequency range characteristic for swept-wing shock buffet. Modes capturing an inboard-running lower-frequency shock unsteadiness centered at a Strouhal number of approximately 0.07 are exclusive to wind-tunnel conditions. Nevertheless, modal analysis succeeds in extracting key characteristics from such practical unsteady-flow datasets. It is anticipated that the current findings with help clarify these edge-of-the-envelope flow phenomena and ultimately inform shock-buffet delay and control strategies.",58,10
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059220,"The present study focuses on the aerodynamic performance of an aircraft wing with surface heating for thermal management applications. The inclusion of electric components leads to a significant necessity for thermal management. A novel method is examined in this study, in which the heat to be dissipated from an aircraft can be transferred to the boundary layer formed on the wing surfaces of the aircraft and gain some performance benefits on the aerodynamic side. Two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics tools in the framework of design of experiment methods are used to analyze the plausibility of placing a heat exchanger on the wing surfaces from an aerodynamic perspective. The Reynolds number, angle of attack, heat exchanger location, and magnitude of heat flux are considered as the factors; and response surfaces are constructed to identify their effects on the aerodynamics of the surface-heated wing. The simulation results are also used to interpret the significant tendencies indicated by the response surfaces. At the lowest values of the heat flux, the angle of attack, and the Reynolds number, surface heating at the best locations produced a 2.5% increase in the lift coefficient and a 1.6% reduction in the drag coefficient.",58,10
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058695,"This Paper introduces a generic force decomposition method derived from mechanical energy conservation. A transformation from relative to absolute reference frame captures the power transfer from pressure and skin-friction forces on aircraft surfaces to mechanisms in the flowfield. A unique flow-feature extraction procedure isolates these mechanisms into different regions including the jet-plume substructures as well as shocks and shear layers located externally to the jet. Featured is a novel shear-layer identification metric that captures both laminar and turbulent regions. The resulting energy balance is rearranged into a force decomposition formulation with contributions attributed to shocks, jets, lift-induced vortices, and the remaining wake. Boundary-layer ingestion is used to demonstrate the method where a potential for energy recovery factor is introduced and defines the amount of energy available at the trailing edge of an unpowered body. Computational fluid dynamics results of a fuselage suggest 10% of its drag power is available for reuse. Computational fluid dynamics studies of a boundary-layer ingesting propulsor show local minima in power consumption at a given thrust split for particular combinations of fan pressure ratio and amount of boundary layer ingested. A noteworthy finding reveals significant contributions of volumetric pressure work, a term often neglected in previous work.",58,10

(“Predictions of a Supersonic Turbulent Flow in a Square Duct,” AIAA Paper 2013-0860, Jan. 2013) are proposed. These modifications result from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies in the FUN3D and OVERFLOW solvers of the flowfield in the body boundary layer and near-corner region of the NASA Juncture Flow model. When used in conjunction with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model with rotation/curvature correction, the new relations improve the CFD Reynolds normal stress predictions, as compared with the experiment. This improvement leads to better predictions of separated corner flow behavior across a wide range of angles of attack that were measured, somewhat beyond the original QCR effect. The model’s performance in a square duct, driven by turbulence-induced vortices, is slightly improved. The QCR remains fairly simple to program and compatible with other eddy-viscosity models.",58,10

However, multirotor configurations introduce strong aerodynamic and aeroacoustic interactions that are not captured through conventional aircraft design tools. This paper explores the capability of the viscous vortex particle method (VPM) to model multirotor aerodynamic interactions at a computational cost suitable for conceptual design. A VPM-based rotor model is introduced along with recommendations for numerical stability and computational efficiency. Validation of the individual rotor is presented in both hovering and forward-flight configurations at low, moderate, and high Reynolds numbers. Hovering multirotor predictions are compared with experimental measurements, evidencing the suitability of the proposed model to capture the thrust drop and unsteady loading produced by rotor-on-rotor interactions.",58,10

However, there are a number of concerns surrounding their acoustic emissions. This contribution presents a novel multiconfiguration CROR that offers considerable noise reductions. In particular, locking either the fore or aft rotor during takeoff is considered, with the running rotor providing the required thrust. During cruise, both rotors are operated to retain the high efficiency of the CROR. A coupled computational fluid dynamics/computational aeroacoustics analysis has shown the potential of this multiconfiguration concept to offer substantial noise reductions when compared to a baseline CROR. During a simulated constant-altitude flyover at takeoff conditions, reductions of 3.5 and 7.9 dBA have been demonstrated when either the fore or aft row is locked, respectively. Using the effective perceived noise level metric, this result corresponded to 7 and 12 Effective Perceived Noise Level (in Decibels), respectively, for the same flyover.",58,10

Unsteady pressure data were obtained via pressure-sensitive paint and discrete pressure transducers. Comparison of baseline (without blowing) and continuous blowing conditions affirmed that leading-edge blowing greatly mitigates surface pressure fluctuations. Transient shutoff experiments showed that sharp increases in surface pressure fluctuations were well-related to the pressure response of the wake region downstream of the leading-edge slots. Moreover, a delay in the amplitude rise of mode 1 compared with mode 2 was found to be statistically significant. The reverse operation of transient blowing turn-on produced a nearly instantaneous decrease in pressure fluctuations, with modal amplitudes damping out over a short period of time. For both cases, variabilities from run to run existed and are likely linked to the condition of the cavity flow at the instance of impulsive flow control operation.",58,10

The current study presents experimental data on the response of cavity dynamics to the introduction of various store configurations mounted at different locations within the cavity. A rectangular cavity was subjected to Mach 2 flow at Reynolds numbers ranging from 4 to 16 million. Measurements were carried out inside the cavity and on the flow-facing surface of the store to capture the cavity acoustics and unsteady loading on the store. Results show that, with an increase in the Reynolds number, the magnitude of pressure fluctuations increases, whereas the frequency of dominant tones remains the same. In general, the presence of a store results in suppression in broadband noise, with amplification/suppression of different Rossiter modes. The location of the store with respect to the cavity shear layer plays an important role in the cavity acoustics. There is a strong correlation between the acoustic signatures measured at various locations in the cavity and on the store surface, indicating the global resonance.",58,10

A sharp, unswept fin at a 15 deg angle of attack in Mach 2 flow generates a 45 deg oblique shock that interacts with the boundary layer on the tunnel floor. This type of SBLI has been extensively studied in quasi-two-dimensional representations, but no work up to this point has been done to capture true 3-D measurements. This work represents the first 3-D velocity field measurements in supersonic flow using plenoptic PIV, as well as the first 3-D velocity measurements of a fin-generated SBLI. Flow features including the -shock structure and slip region expected from this SBLI were able to be resolved, and the 3-D imaging allowed for better visualization of the overall flow topology. Plenoptic PIV enabled the visualization of features not considered in previous literature, particularly the 3-D curvature of the inviscid shock and effects from an expansion region emanating from the fin tip due to the finite fin height.

A number of attempts by computational fluid dynamics modelers to reproduce the published results were unsuccessful in predicting the peak vibrational temperature, the downstream slope, or both. Our recent analysis has shown that some of the assumptions used in spectra-to-temperature conversions, such as the two-temperature approximation, are violated in the early region of the shock, and a more detailed analysis and direct comparison of UV absorption, and not temperatures, is necessary. This work presents such an analysis where a gas number density, translational temperature, and distribution of rotational and vibrational level populations, obtained using a kinetic gas dynamic approach, are converted into UV in-band absorption for each temporal or spatial location in the shock using a detailed spectroscopic model. The computed UV absorption is then directly compared with the raw measured time-dependent UV absorption curves at several wavelengths.

In case the dataset is inconsistent, our framework allows one to hypothesize and test sources of inconsistencies. This is crucial in model validation efforts. The framework relies on Bayesian inference to estimate experimental settings deemed uncertain, from measurements deemed accurate. The quality of the inferred variables is gauged by its ability to reproduce held-out experimental measurements. The correctness of the framework is tested on three double-cone experiments conducted in the Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center’s Large Energy National Shock Tunnel-I (LENS-I), which have also been numerically simulated successfully. Thereafter, the framework is used to investigate two double-cone experiments (executed in the LENS-XX), which have encountered difficulties when used in model validation exercises. An inconsistency is detected with one of the LENS-XX experiments. In addition, two causes are hypothesized for our inability to simulate LEXS-XX experiments accurately and are tested using our framework. It is found that there is no single cause that explains all the discrepancies between model predictions and experimental data, but different causes explain different discrepancies, to larger or smaller extent. This paper proposes that uncertainty quantification methods be used more widely to understand experiments and characterize facilities, and three different methods are cited to do so, the third of which is presented in this paper.",58,10

The experimental work was supported with two-dimensional and three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Comparisons between numerical and experimental results show initial rise in heat transfer at the first shock-wave boundary-layer interaction, followed by an unsteady laminar region interspersed with possible turbulent spots. Heat transfer measurements along the wall that show sustained transition to turbulence did not occur within the full length of the duct. Transition to turbulence within the circular duct is significantly delayed when compared with estimations based on flat-plate results. These results indicate that there is value in revisiting the assumption of a fully turbulent boundary layer for previous semi-direct-connect scramjet combustion experiments that have used transition length correlations derived from flat-plate experiments within the same facility.

The assessment focuses on how the LES prediction changes for increasingly anisotropic grids in forced isotropic turbulence and channel flow at high Reynolds number. Although some length scales perform better than others, the main conclusion is that no single length scale produces LES results that are completely independent of the grid anisotropy.

Dissipative damping and positive velocity feedback are shown to constructively cooperate to bring about such stability. In contrast to the well-known Kelvin–Tait–Chetaev paradigm, which states that gyroscopically stabilized unstable potential systems are always made unstable in the presence of the slightest dissipation of energy, the paper points to a new paradigm, which states that the proper simultaneous dissipation and infusion of energy into generic gyroscopically stabilized unstable potential systems guarantees their exponential stability.

In this paper, the governing equations are derived by describing the motion of a thermoelastic body in an undeformed body frame by means of the variational principle applied to four invariants: the kinetic energy, the gravitational potential energy, the thermoelastic potential, and the dissipation function. Particular cases of longitudinal and lateral flight dynamics of a thermoelastic body including longitudinal flight of a thermoelastic beam are considered.
