Optical spectra of turbulent spots were similar to spectra for fully turbulent boundary layers, and the average thickness of the boundary layer during the turbulent spot was approximately 50% of the fully turbulent boundary layer. The convective speed of the leading edge of the spot was measured to be 0.95 of the freestream speed, whereas the trailing edge moves at 0.7 of the freestream speed. The dominant frequency of the wave packet structures was about 70 kHz, consistent with the theoretically predicted second-mode frequency; the average convective speed of the packets was measured to be 0.88 of the freestream speed. Using the frozen field hypothesis, the wave fronts were stitched together to reveal streamwise/spanwise topology of the packets. The packets were found to be fairly narrow, about in the spanwise direction, extending for in the streamwise direction.",55,11
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055502,"Experimental evidence indicates that boundary layers in hypersonic flows transition from being laminar to turbulent via the mechanism of formation and propagation of turbulent spots. Turbulent spots have been detected using either surface heat transfer gauge signals or pressure traces, or they have been visualized using high-speed schlieren techniques. The extent of the transition zone is strongly dependent on the rate of initiation of turbulent spots and spot propagation parameters. However, it is not possible at present to predict the turbulent spot initiation rates in hypersonic transitional flows. As a first step toward developing an effective predictive model for the purpose, a methodology is developed to enable estimation of the spot initiation rate and intermittency distribution from experimental heat transfer data. The methodology is validated by comparison with experimental data where both the heat transfer and intermittency were measured. The methodology is then used in a predictive mode on three experimental datasets, and it is found to give good agreement. This enables prediction of other important variables as well, including skin friction and a wide variety of other boundary-layer properties in the transition zone at hypersonic Mach numbers.",55,11
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056018,"This paper presents a transition prediction model that adds additional equations to the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes set. It is based on the so-called -factor method, which is valid for natural transition on wings due to the hypothesis that it relies on (modal instabilities disturbing the boundary layer). It consists of an integration of the disturbance growth rates along the edge streamline. Herein, the disturbance growth rates are obtained via a database approach: ONERA—The French Aerospace Lab’s so-called parabolas method. Numerically, integration of the growth rates along the edge streamline is performed through additional transport equations, thus removing the need for any topology specification from the end user. Implementation caveats are illustrated on the ONERA-D airfoil in incompressible conditions. This method is then successfully applied for transition prediction on a two-dimensional industrial laminar airfoil at transonic conditions, with varying upstream conditions and angles of attack. Satisfactory agreements with both the experimental data and the conventional transition predictions (local, linear stability results) are obtained, which illustrate the accuracy of the predicted transition location.",55,11

This paper focuses on the second bifurcation, which is responsible for the onset of the unsteadiness. Using the highly efficient Nek5000 parallel solver together with a recently developed numerical algorithm to stabilize and accelerate the numerical solution, it was possible to identify the three-dimensional eigenmode responsible for the second bifurcation. The characteristics of this eigenmode are analyzed in detail. The value of the critical Reynolds number , as well as the Strouhal number of the arising limit cycle, agree well with previous experimental and numerical investigations. To further assess the nature of the instability, an adjoint-based sensitivity analysis is carried out. The structure of the direct and adjoint modes are discussed, and then the core of the instability is localized. Finally, the sensitivity of the instability to a generic base flow modification is investigated.",55,11

Results are presented for the aerodynamic force measurements, wake development, and energy content of the wake turbulent structure at moderate chord-based Reynolds numbers . The aerodynamic force measurements have shown that the use of trailing-edge serrations for cambered airfoils can lead to significant reductions in the lift coefficient at low angles of attack but does not particularly change the stall characteristics of the airfoils. The wake flow results have shown that the use of serrations can lead to considerable reduction of the wake turbulence intensity, which is shown to be due to a complex interaction between the flowfield over the tip and root planes of the serration in the near wake. Furthermore, power spectral density results pertaining to wake turbulence indicate that the implementation of serrations deenergizes the wake flow over a wide range of frequencies.",55,11
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055708,"A torsional spring was added to the leading edge of a free-to-pivot rectangular aspect ratio four flat plate wing to observe the effect of discrete compliance on the wing force and angle-of-attack response at a Reynolds number of 20,000. The spring stiffness was varied between a completely free-to-pivot wing and a rigidly attached wing, with two cases in between. The addition of springs was found to force the wing at a higher angle of attack than the free-to-pivot case, and thus increase force production. The wing acceleration distance and Reynolds number were also varied. The Reynolds number had a significant effect on the steady-state forces due to variation in the dynamic pressure, but acceleration had little impact. A low-order model of the wing dynamics based on thin airfoil theory was discussed and applied to the specified wing kinematics. The results of this model showed promising agreement during the transient and reasonable success once the wing reached steady state, paving the way for better design and control of flapping-wing micro air vehicles.",55,11
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055755,"This paper presents the experimental assessment of the aerodynamic benefit of boundary layer ingestion for an advanced design civil transport aircraft, the D8 “double bubble,” carried out from 2010 to 2015 as part of a NASA Phase 2 Program. A back-to-back comparison of non-boundary layer ingesting and boundary layer ingesting versions of the D8 was conducted using 1:11-scale powered models in the NASA Langley 14- by 22-foot subsonic tunnel. The aerodynamic benefit of boundary layer ingestion, as quantified by the difference in mechanical flow power required with boundary layer ingestion relative to the non-boundary layer ingesting case, was measured using two different methods to be 8.6% at the simulated cruise condition when the same propulsors are used on the two configurations. The benefit is found to be insensitive to the various modeling and processing assumptions. A detailed error analysis shows that the benefit has an uncertainty fraction of 0.21 and a 95% confidence interval fraction of 0.035, thus giving high confidence to these results. This work represents the first measurement of boundary layer ingestion performance improvements for a realistic civil aircraft configuration and provides a proof-of-concept for the use of boundary layer ingestion to improve fuel efficiency of subsonic transports.",55,11
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055745,"The performance of two wall models based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes is compared in large-eddy simulation of a high Reynolds number separating and reattaching flow over the NASA wall-mounted hump. Wall modeling significantly improves flow prediction on a coarse grid where the large-eddy simulation with the no-slip wall boundary condition fails. Low-order statistics from the wall-modeled large-eddy simulation are in good agreement with the experiment. Wall-pressure fluctuations from the resolved-scale solution are in good agreement with the experiment, whereas wall shear-stress fluctuations modeled entirely through the wall models appear to be significantly underpredicted. Although the two wall models produce comparable results in the upstream attached flow region, the nonequilibrium wall model outperforms the equilibrium wall model in the separation bubble and recovery region where the key assumptions in the equilibrium model are shown to be invalid.",55,11
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056103,"A numerical investigation of low-frequency unsteadiness in a Mach 2.9 turbulent, reattaching shear layer was carried out with delayed detached-eddy simulation. The results were compared to data from a series of experiments performed at Princeton University. The true experimental conditions were matched, and calculations were run for 0.5 s of physical time, capturing a frequency range of about 10 Hz to 1 MHz and about 65 cycles of the Strouhal number 0.03 scale. Because of the approximations used to reduce computational cost, the computations predicted a greater flow turning angle at separation than was measured experimentally. Accounting for the consequent shift in reattachment location, the mean flow properties were predicted fairly accurately. The computations overpredicted the intensity of pressure fluctuation near reattachment, but they captured the form of the pressure fluctuation spectrum accurately. The discrepancies between the computational results and the experimental data may be the result of mean flow three-dimensionality and large-scale fluctuations in the incoming boundary layer that were not accounted for in the numerical model. Few computational studies have captured such long timescales for a high-Reynolds-number flow, and the results indicate the feasibility of studying very low-frequency unsteadiness in reattaching flows with a detached-eddy simulation. The results may also provide guidance for the total simulated time required to fully capture flows with large, slow recirculation zones.",55,11
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055378,"A unified hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation closure is presented that is built from data-driven methods. This is a novel way to construct such models that does not impose constraints. Direct numerical simulation data is filtered, and the ratio of resolved to unresolved energy is used to fit an ideal length scale damping function for the unified framework. This study shows the viability of using high-fidelity data, not just for a priori testing but for the complete creation of lower-fidelity methods. Alongside the physical model, a convection scheme is proposed that marries well to it. This numerical scheme ensures that the damped turbulence model is provided the appropriate ratio of stability to accuracy. Furthermore, an additional function guarantees that the large-eddy simulation mode is only active in vortical flow. This hybrid closure is then applied to two industrially relevant yet very different geometries for which reliable reference data exist. The periodic hills test case is characterized by a confined separation and reattachment, whereas the tandem cylinders exhibits massive separation with wake interference patterns. For the latter, aeroacoustic predictions are of paramount importance. On both geometries, two mesh levels are tested. This a posteriori validation program provides a stern test for the new closure. For both resolutions on both geometries, the new formulation performs extremely well. Each case is also predicted using an established closure, and comparison to this further illustrates the potential of the current framework.",55,11
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055819,"This paper introduces a shock-wave-detection technique based on the schlieren imaging for continuum and rarefied-gas flows. The scheme is applicable for any existing two-dimensional flowfields obtained by experimental or numerical approaches. A Gaussian distribution for a schlieren function within the shock-wave region is considered. This enables the authors to access any desired locations through the shock (e.g., shock center, or leading- and trailing-edge locations). The bow shock-wave profile is described via a rational function, which could be employed for the estimation of shock angle. The relation between pre- and postshock flow properties along the shock wave with a high resolution can be investigated by using this technique. The technique is verified in a novel way based on the well-known gas dynamics curves (i.e., flow-deflection angle vs shock angle and shock polar diagrams). High-speed continuum, near continuum, and rarefied-gas flows over a wedge and cylinder are considered for evaluation of the proposed technique. The results show a very good agreement with existing analytical relations for continuum flow.",55,11

Early measurements suggested the cold air added to the arc-heated gas to control enthalpy was not well mixed, and modifications were made to add a mixing volume in the plenum between adding air and the expansion. Measurements of the gas temperature conducted before and after this modification are presented. An external cavity diode laser was wavelength scanned to monitor the population of electronically excited (3s) oxygen atoms via absorption by the transition near 777.2 nm. Assuming thermochemical equilibrium, the population of electronically excited 3s atoms provided a sensitive measurement of the gas temperature in the 4000–8000 K range expected in the arc-heater plenum. Time-resolved measurements were obtained on multiple lines of sight, and differences between the inferred temperatures for the different lines of sight revealed important details regarding the degree of flowfield uniformity in the arcjet plenum.",55,11
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055687,"This article presents an analysis of a planar particle image velocimetry experiment aiming at measuring the phase-averaged velocity fields of a synthetic jet generated by a plasma synthetic jet actuator. Three major sources of uncertainty related to this type of experiment are examined: the phase-averaging process, the estimation of the vertical position of the wall into which the actuator is inserted, and the position of the laser sheet plane. Furthermore, the present work investigates the errors related to the dynamics of the particles used for seeding this type of high-speed transient flow. As expected, uncertainties associated with the phase-averaging process and the estimation of the wall position may be directly estimated from the measurements. However, estimation of the uncertainties originating from the position of the laser sheet plane and the errors related to the particle dynamics require additional information. In the present work, an original methodology relying on a numerical model of the actuator is thus proposed. This model, based on a large-eddy simulation, is able to reproduce the main features of the jet observed in the experiments and is used to generate realistic synthetic particle images. The influence of the laser sheet position on the velocity uncertainties and the errors associated with the particle dynamics are then explored. Experimental and numerical findings are considered to conclude in a quantitative manner on the dominant sources of uncertainty for such experiments and on the errors induced by particle dynamics that should be expected.",55,11
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055682,"To enhance the performance of a dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator, a dual-grounded trielectrode plasma actuator, which has an electrically grounded and insulated third electrode on the alternating-current electrode, was suggested. In this research, the discharge structures, body force fields, and flowfield of the conventional dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator and the dual-grounded trielectrode plasma actuator were investigated with a plasma simulation and a fluid simulation to clarify the performance improvement mechanism of the dual-grounded trielectrode plasma actuator. First, the validity of the simulation results was confirmed by comparing the results between the experiment and the simulation. Next, a detailed investigation of the plasma structures, the body force fields, and the flow velocity distributions was conducted. As a result, the following performance improvement mechanism was clarified. The body force generated near the alternating-current electrode edge effectively accelerated the flow. By putting the third electrode close to the alternating-current electrode edge, the plasma generated around the third electrode was supplied to the region near the alternating-current electrode edge, and the body force contributing to the flow acceleration was drastically enhanced. In addition, the vertical expansion of body force also contributed to the performance enhancement. The induced flow became thicker, and the rate of momentum loss by the friction force on the dielectric surface decreased.",55,11
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055727,"This paper investigates the control of leading-edge flow separation over an airfoil using a dielectric-barrier discharge plasma actuator. A chord-based Reynolds number and an angle of attack are and 18.8 deg, respectively. The flow around the stalled airfoil is computed by using large-eddy simulations. The body-force distribution-based plasma actuator model is adopted and set near the leading edge of the airfoil. Effects of a nondimensional burst frequency with a constant duty cycle on the performance of flow control are studied. It is found that, for the cases of the nondimensional burst frequencies 5, 10, 25, and 50, lift-to-drag ratios increase in comparison with that in the cases of the burst frequencies 1 and 100 and without the control. Controlled flow separates near the 30% chord from the leading edge due to adverse pressure gradient associated with the angle of attack. Mechanisms of suppression of the leading-edge flow separation in those cases are discussed.",55,11
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055925,"Results of thrust measurements of dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators are presented. The test setup, measurement, and data processing methodology that were developed in prior work were used. The tests were conducted with high-density polyethylene actuators of three thicknesses. The applied voltage driving the actuators was a pure sinusoidal waveform. The test setup was a suspended actuator with a decoupling liquid interface. The tests were conducted at low ambient humidity. The thrust was measured with an analytical balance and the results were corrected for antithrust to isolate the plasma-generated thrust. Applying this approach resulted in smooth and repeatable data. It also enabled precise curve fitting that yielded quadratic relations between the plasma thrust and voltage in log–log space at constant frequencies. The results contrast power law relationships developed in literature that now appear to be an approximation only over a limited voltage range.",55,11
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056010,"The excitation of trapped diametral acoustic modes within a rectangular cavity attached to a cylindrical duct is investigated numerically and experimentally. Because the excited acoustic modes are highly three-dimensional, their interaction with the cavity shear layer results in complex patterns of flow oscillations. These are investigated for the special case of a square cavity, which exhibits three unique behaviors of the excited acoustic modes, including both stationary and spinning mode patterns. Phase-locked particle image velocimetry flow visualization accompanied with numerical simulation of the resonant sound fields indicate that the formation of disturbances is nonuniform and akin to the radial acoustic particle velocity distribution. In the instance of two acoustic modes being excited simultaneously, separate circumferential segments of the cylindrical shear layer do oscillate independently and at different frequencies, corresponding to the frequencies of the excited modes. Further, because of the symmetry inherent within the square geometry, two degenerate modes (i.e., orthogonal mode shapes with the same resonance frequency) generate a spinning mode when they are excited. The interaction of the spinning acoustic mode with the cavity shear layer leads to the formation of a three-dimensional helical vortex structure. These results underline the fact that a uniform excitation over the whole shear-layer circumference is not necessary for the generation of orderly vortical structures that maintain their coherence over the whole length of the cavity and sustain strong acoustic resonances.",55,11
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055931,"A hybrid aeroacoustic formulation, which is well suited for the computation of rotating systems, is presented. It is based on a decomposition of flow (incompressible part) and acoustic (compressible part) quantities, is applicable to high-Reynolds-number and low-Mach-number flows, accounts convective effects on the wave propagation, and features only a scalar unknown (i.e., the acoustic velocity potential), thus reducing the computational effort significantly. To show the accuracy and applicability of our approach, the proposed method is applied to an axial fan. Thereby, the experimental setup is discussed in detail, and measurements are performed toward the flow and acoustic field. Furthermore, the computation of the flowfield is presented along with the evaluation of the acoustic source terms, its efficient and accurate interpolation to the acoustic grid, and the computation of the generated acoustic sound. The comparison of local and global physical quantities, both for the flow as well as for acoustics, shows good agreement and demonstrates the applicability of the present aeroacoustic approach for rotating systems.",55,11
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055643,"In regard to aircraft noise mitigation, this paper focuses on noise emission by a simplified nose landing gear (NLG), whose noise sources are identified by the means of sensor array methods. More precisely, following a former characterization of the aeroacoustics by the NLG via dedicated experiments and computations, the subsequent experimental and numerical noise signals are applied two popular sensor array methods of noise localization, namely, classical beam forming (CBF) and deconvolution approach for the mapping of acoustic sources (DAMAS). The resulting noise source maps are then analyzed from both the points of view of phenomenology (NLG noise generation mechanisms) and methodology (noise localization methods and application). The results show how sensor array methods (more especially DAMAS) are capable of revealing the underlying physics of the NLG noise source mechanisms, whether it is within an experimental or a computational context. This speaks in favor of a more systematic use of sensor array methods for investigating the noise physics of aircraft components.",55,11
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055804,"In this paper, a novel low-order blade element momentum model, called flux-line theory, is developed for predicting the performance of cycloturbines (variable-pitch vertical-axis wind turbines). It improves upon prior momentum theories by capturing flow expansion/contraction and bending through the turbine. This is accomplished by performing fluid calculations in a coordinate system fixed to streamlines for which the spatial locations are not predescribed. A transformation determines the Cartesian location of streamlines through the rotor disk, and additional calculations determine the power and forces produced. Validations against three sets of experimental data demonstrate improvement over other existing streamtube models. An extension of the theory removes dependence on a blade element model to better understand how turbine–fluid interaction impacts power production. A numerical optimization and simplified analytical analysis identify that maximum power (for a turbine that exclusively decelerates the flow) is produced when the upstream portion of the rotor does not interact with the flow, whereas the downstream portion of the turbine decelerates the flow by just over one-third of the freestream value. The theoretical power coefficient limit falls in a range below 0.8, depending on the prescription of the submodel describing the angle at which the flow crosses the blade path (0.597 for the best-fit model). A larger effective turbine area explains the higher-than-Betz limit result.",55,11
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055949,"The mean gaseous motion in solid rocket motors has been traditionally described using an inviscid solution in a porous tube of fixed radius and uniform wall injection. This model, usually referred to as the Taylor–Culick profile, consists of a rotational solution that captures the bulk gaseous motion in a frictionless rocket chamber. In practice, however, the port radius increases as the propellant burns, thus leading to time-dependent effects on the mean flow. This work considers the related problem in the context of viscous motion in a porous tube and allows the radius to be time dependent. By implementing a similarity transformation in space and time, the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are first reduced to a nonlinear fourth-order ordinary differential equation with four boundary conditions. This equation is then solved both numerically and asymptotically, using the injection Reynolds number and the dimensionless wall regression ratio as primary and secondary perturbation parameters. In this manner, closed-form analytical solutions are obtained for both large and small Reynolds number with small-to-moderate . The resulting approximations are then compared with the numerical solution obtained for an equivalent third-order ordinary differential equation in which both shooting and the irregular limit that affects the fourth-order formulation are circumvented. This code is found to be capable of producing the stable solutions for this problem over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and wall regression ratios.",55,11

The methodology models the fluid with compressible Euler equations and the structure with Timoshenko beam elements. The tightly coupled equations of the two disciplines are linearized to formulate a stability eigenvalue problem, which is rewritten in a form that is well known as the flutter solution method. The rate of convergence is measured in the norm defined by the relative error in instability speed for polynomial orders from 1 to 4. This is done for the divergence mode at Mach 0.7 and the flutter mode at Mach 1.1. The influence of relative order of basis functions for structural and fluid disciplines is investigated on the rate of convergence. The results show that, for most cases, the error converges at a rate of approximately for a th-order polynomial. A comparison of the computational cost shows that, in comparison with the conventional linear interpolation schemes, the high-order polynomials can provide the same level of accuracy with over an order-of-magnitude reduction in computational cost.",55,11

The actuator is a single pulsed minijet injected radially into the main jet before its issue. The excitation frequency for the minjet is controlled by an electromagnetic valve. The open-loop control measurements indicate that, given the duty cycle and the mass flow rate ratio of the minijet to the main jet, the decay rate of jet centerline mean velocity, which provides a measure for jet mixing, displays a maximum at the optimum frequency ratio , where is the preferred-mode frequency of the main jet. Comparison is made between the modified and classical systems.

Existing work has generally been limited to the use of a single, simple functional in the formulation of the adjoint. As a result, the full potential of adjoint-based design has not yet been realized. This work focuses on the derivation and implementation of an adjoint formulation of the RANS equations for generalized outflow-based functionals that allows information from external models to be coupled with the high-fidelity gradient calculation, and expands the range and complexity of objectives that can be used. As an example application this is applied to supersonic combustion ramjets (scramjets), which have the potential to enable more efficient transatmospheric flight, airplane-like operations of launch vehicles, and defense-related applications. Challenges in their design can be addressed by optimization as well as by other gradient-dependent techniques.

Because of limited resources and sampling uncertainty, the estimated probabilities have both aleatory randomness and epistemic uncertainty. In this paper, two approaches are used to estimate the confidence intervals of component- and system-level probabilities. The first approach uses an analytical method, where a normal distribution is assumed for the component- and system-level probabilities. Another approach is the bootstrap method, which uses resampling to build a distribution of the probabilities. Global sensitivity is analyzed as well to identify the component-level probability that most significantly affects the uncertainty in the system level. It is shown that the confidence intervals of system probability can be effectively narrowed by reducing sampling uncertainty in the most significant component.",55,11

However, often, the probability distribution of such uncertainties does not exist or is unknown, and a designer looking to perform a robust optimization is tasked with deciding how to represent these uncertainties within the optimization framework. This paper asks the following: “How important is the choice of how to represent input uncertainties mathematically in robust airfoil optimization?” It specifically compares probabilistically based aleatory uncertainties and interval-based epistemic uncertainties. This is first investigated by considering optimizations on several algebraic test problems, which illustrate the mechanisms by which the representation of uncertainty becomes significant in a robust optimization. This insight is then used to predict and subsequently demonstrate that, for two airfoil design problems, the advantage of doing a robust optimization over a deterministic optimization is similar, regardless of how the input uncertainties are represented mathematically. The benefit of this is potentially eliminating the time required to establish an accurate representation of the uncertainties from the preliminary stage of design, where time is a valuable resource.",55,11

The proposed method incorporates aspects of Gibbs sampling, importance resampling, and density estimation to ensure that, under mild assumptions, the current method is provably convergent in distribution. The method uses the samples available from previously simulating the disciplines by applying sequential importance resampling. The absence or lack of samples in each discipline is addressed by introducing an adaptive greedy sample increment process to improve the efficiency of uncertainty analysis with minimum possible computational cost. A key feature of the approach is that disciplinary models are all synthesized independently based on their available data, and it does not require any full coupled system-level evaluations. The proposed approach is illustrated on the propagation of uncertainty for an aerodynamics–structures system and is compared to a system-level Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis approach.",55,11
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055705,"An approach is presented for modeling spatially varying uncertainty in the ply orientations of composite structures. Lamination parameters are used with the aim of reducing the required number of random variables. Karhunen–Loève expansion is employed to decompose the uncertainty in each ply into a sum of random variables and spatially dependent functions. An intrusive polynomial chaos expansion is proposed to approximate the lamination parameters while preserving the separation of the random and spatial dependency. Closed-form expressions are derived for the expansion coefficients in two case studies; an initial example in which uncertainty is modeled using random variables, and a second random field example. The approach is compared against Monte Carlo simulation results for a variety of layups as well as closed-form expressions for the mean and covariance. By summing the polynomial chaos basis functions through the laminate thickness, the separation of the random and spatial dependency may be preserved at a laminate level and the number of random variables reduced for some minimum number of plies. The number of variables increases nonlinearly with the number of Karhunen–Loève expansion terms, and as such, the approach is only beneficial in low-order expansions using relatively few Karhunen–Loève expansion terms.",55,11
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056004,"The uncertainty present in many structural systems is commonly modeled using probabilistic, fuzzy, or interval approaches depending on the nature of uncertainty present. The probabilistic approach is based on the probability distributions of the uncertain parameters, which are not known for most practical systems. The fuzzy analysis is applicable to systems whose parameters are described in terms of linguistic and imprecise or vague statements. In most practical systems, particularly structural systems, the parameters such as the geometry (sizes of members), material properties, and loads are available as ranges or intervals. For such systems, the use of interval analysis, coupled with the finite element analysis, appears to be appropriate for predicting the ranges of the response quantities such as nodal displacements and element stresses. However, the accuracy of the results given by the interval analysis suffers from the so-called dependency problem, which can lead to undesirable expansions of the ranges of the computed results. Depending on the nature of expressions involved in the computation and the width of the ranges (intervals) of the uncertain parameters, the computed response quantities may sometimes violate the physical laws. Although several approaches, such as numerical truncation during interval arithmetic operations, parameterization of intervals, and the use of subintervals within an interval, have been suggested to limit the growth of the intervals of the results predicted, there has not been a simple approach that can improve the accuracy of the basic interval analysis. This work presents a new methodology, called universal grey number (or system) theory, for the analysis of systems whose parameters are described as intervals or ranges. The computational feasibility and improved accuracy (compared to the interval analysis) of the methodology is demonstrated by considering three examples: the stress analysis of a stepped bar, the stress analysis of a planar 10-bar truss, and the rigid-body (vertical) response of an airplane taxiing on a wavy runway based on a single-degree-of-freedom model. This work demonstrates that the universal grey system approach is a viable methodology for the accurate analysis of structural and other engineering problems involving uncertain parameters that are described in terms of ranges or intervals.",55,11

When thin metal sheets are used, the deformation can become plastic and localized, allowing for permanent intricate shapes to be formed. In this study, the illustrative case of an annular plate under diametral tension is considered, and it is shown that the deformed shape can be considered as a spatial mechanism of localized plastic yield lines connected to largely undeformed regions. This technique provides useful information for the design of novel permanently deployable structures.",55,11
