0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056779,"Recently, plasma actuators have been employed to control laminar-to-turbulent transition in Blasius flow by exciting counter-rotating longitudinal vortices. Due to the resulting momentum redistribution, the vortices generate a spanwise modulation of the flow with regions of high and low streamwise velocity, which are commonly denoted as streaks. In the case of moderate amplitudes, the streaks yield a stabilization of the flow by reducing the amplification of Tollmien–Schlichting waves, and hence delayed transition. In the present work, two fundamentally different actuator setups are investigated: a symmetrical one, exciting counter-rotating vortices; and a nonsymmetrical one, exciting corotating vortices. The differences between these setups are discussed in detail, and the respective stabilization of the flow is scrutinized.",56,4

However, two major concerns arise linked to the use of photomultipliers. First, the detection of photon flux is corrupted by the presence of dust particles in the flow. An original signal processing is proposed in this study to remove their signatures. Second, the random arrival of photons on a photomultiplier induces shot noise, which can be partly removed by using two photomultipliers. It is shown in this study that a single photomultiplier combined with suitable processing can also be used to remove shot noise. Both approaches are compared for the case of a compressible subsonic jet exhausting in an anechoic wind tunnel.",56,4

This research area has received much attention during the last two decades and will continue to grow as large-eddy simulation is applied to an even wider range of flows. It is deceptively difficult to generate turbulent inflow fluctuations that are realistic for a specific problem, and various methods have been designed to improve this realism. A review of such turbulent inflow boundary conditions is presented, broadly classified into transition-inducing approaches, turbulence library-based methods, recycling–rescaling-based methods, and synthetic turbulence generators. The last category is given more attention to cover a variety of creative approaches that are found in the literature as well as due to its practicality for problems of industrial interest. Selection of a particular method for a particular application is a compromise between the required fidelity and the allowable complexity and computational expense. Lack of quantitative knowledge about turbulence to be fed into the simulation is recognized as a limiting factor in the effective use of such inflow generators for problems of practical interest.",56,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056453,"The effects of freestream turbulence intensity on the mean topology and transition characteristics of laminar separation bubbles forming over the suction side of a NACA 0018 airfoil are investigated experimentally for angles of attack between 0 and 20 deg, chord Reynolds numbers between 100,000 and 200,000, and freestream turbulence intensities between 0.09 and 2.03%. The results show that increasing freestream turbulence intensity results in earlier transition and reattachment, contributing to an overall decrease in separation bubble length. At lower angles of attack, this is accompanied by a minor decrease in lift, whereas at prestall angles of attack and higher turbulence intensity levels, lift increases and stall is delayed. Spatial amplification rates of disturbances in the separated shear layer are shown to decrease at elevated levels of turbulence intensity, indicating that the earlier transition is attributed solely to the larger initial amplitude of perturbations. At elevated turbulence intensity levels, a broader range of unstable frequencies is detected in the separated shear layer, with the central frequency of the unstable band showing moderate variations with the level of freestream perturbations. The results indicate a change in the transition process at higher freestream turbulence intensity levels, indicative of bypass transition in the boundary layer. The degree of influence of freestream turbulence intensity on the separation bubble is shown to decrease as the chord Reynolds number is increased.",56,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056260,"The complex wake modifications produced by a Gurney flap on symmetric NACA airfoils at low Reynolds number are investigated. Two-dimensional incompressible flows over NACA 0000 (flat plate), 0006, 0012, and 0018 airfoils at a Reynolds number of are analyzed numerically to examine the flow modifications generated by the flaps for achieving lift enhancement. Although high lift can be attained by the Gurney flap on airfoils at high angles of attack, the highly unsteady nature of the aerodynamic forces is also observed. An analysis of the wake structures along with the lift spectra reveals four characteristic wake modes (steady, 2S, P, and 2P), influencing the aerodynamic performance. The effects of the flap over a wide range of angles of attack and flap heights are considered to identify the occurrence of these wake modes, and are encapsulated in a wake-classification diagram. Companion three-dimensional simulations are also performed to examine the influence of three-dimensionality on the wake regimes. The spanwise instabilities that appear for higher angles of attack are found to suppress the emergence of the 2P mode. The use of the wake-classification diagram as a guidance for Gurney-flap selection at different operating conditions to achieve the required aerodynamic performance is discussed.",56,4

The measurements are conducted on a wing that rotates symmetrically about the stroke reversal at a reduced frequency of and Reynolds number of . The Lagrangian finite time Lyapunov exponent method is used to analyze the unsteady flowfields by identifying dynamically relevant flow features such as the primary leading-edge vortex, secondary vortices, and topological saddles as well as their evolution within a flapping cycle. The flow evolution is divided into four stages that are characterized by the leading-edge vortex: 1) emergence, 2) growth, 3) liftoff, and 4) breakdown and decay. The saddle-point trajectory helps in identifying the leading-edge vortex liftoff, which occurs at the maximum stroke velocity. The flowfields are correlated with the aerodynamic forces, revealing that the maximum lift and drag are observed just before leading-edge vortex liftoff. The end of wing rotation in the beginning of the stroke stimulates a change in the direction of the leading-edge vortex growth, and the start of rotation at the end of the stroke triggers the breakdown of the leading-edge vortex.",56,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055994,"Flapping rotary wing is a novel aerodynamic configuration proposed in recent years for micro air vehicles. To understand the aerodynamic characteristics of this wing layout, a computational fluid dynamics method is employed to study how certain geometric parameters of the wings, such as camber of airfoil, radius of the second area moment, twist angle, and aspect ratio, affect the flow behavior, aerodynamic forces, and moments of the flapping rotary wing at various low Reynolds numbers. Although maximum camber of airfoil affects the flow around the flapping rotary wing, it influences only the rotary moment significantly. The increase in radius of the second area moment enhances the leading edge vortex near the tip and increases the mean lift coefficient. The maximum mean rotary moment coefficient was obtained when the wing planform was close to a rectangle. The change in twist angle alters the local effective angle of attack of the wing, thereby influencing the flow and aerodynamic forces. Excessive aspect ratio reduces lift efficiency, whereas the magnitude of rotary moment continuously increases with rising aspect ratio. Based on these findings, some suggestions on the flapping rotary wing design are proposed. These suggestions may be helpful for designers of flapping rotary wing.",56,4

Experiments on a 2D pitching and heaving NACA 0018 airfoil with an actuated trailing-edge flap are performed at a reduced frequency in a free-stream flow with . The model is equipped with 24 differential pressure transducers to provide with the time-resolved distribution of the pressure difference between pressure and suction sides. Results show that an actuated flap significantly decreases the magnitude of unsteady loads. A reduced order model of the flap effect on the loads is proposed. The loads are estimated by adding the contribution of the clean wing with the flap one. This model can be applied to unsteady loads for both attached flow and dynamic stall conditions, constituting an effective control strategy for dynamic loads, if the airfoil transition location is properly controlled.",56,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056047,"Vortex unsteadiness around a hemisphere cylinder at angles of attack of 10–80 deg was studied using large-eddy simulation and dynamic mode decomposition. The cylinder body has a fineness ratio of 24.5 (length-to-diameter ratio). The results revealed that oscillations of leeward vortices exist over a forebody at the whole range of angles of attack in addition to vortex shedding at an afterbody. The vortex oscillations consist of antisymmetric modes (alternate oscillation) and symmetric modes (in-phase oscillation). The alternate vortex oscillations correspond to the most energetic modes and are responsible for fluctuating sectional side forces at the forebody that are greater than the ones from vortex shedding at the afterbody. The Strouhal numbers of both alternate vortex oscillations and shedding at angles of attack of 10–40 deg are similar with , whereas at angles of attack of 50–80 deg, the Strouhal numbers are apparently divided into two regimes: the vortex oscillations with at the forebody, and the vortex shedding with at the afterbody. The vortex shedding regions progressively move forward with increasing angles of attack, and accordingly the regions of vortex oscillations contract and eventually only exist near the nose at sufficiently high angles of attack. The computed frequencies are in good agreement with the measured values of hot-wire probes in previous experiments.",56,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056186,"The flow interactions between streamwise-aligned wall-mounted circular cylinders is studied experimentally to explore shear-layer interactions that lead to modifications of the flow around the downstream-most cylinder. Two identical finite-length cylinders are arranged in tandem and fully submerged in the log layer of turbulent channel flow, and particle image velocimetry measurements are conducted to document the flow behavior at various streamwise spacings. Comparisons are made to flow around an isolated cylinder as well as the baseline case of smooth-wall turbulent channel flow with no cylinders present. Strong interactions between the shear layers shed by each individual cylinder are noted, whereby the downstream-most wake exhibits a weaker, more spatially compact recirculation region and significantly reduced reattachment length as compared to flow around an isolated cylinder. First- and second-order turbulence statistics show similar wake modifications, particularly for small cylinder spacings where the shear layer shed from the top of the upstream cylinder directly impinges on the downstream-most cylinder and significantly reduces the turbulence levels in the downstream shear layer. Increasing the spacing of the cylinders relaxes the turbulence statistics in the shear layer of the downstream-most cylinder back toward those of an isolated cylinder, although even a spacing of eight cylinder diameters is not sufficient to fully recover isolated cylinder behavior. Finally, the impact of the cylinder aspect ratio is considered is found to have only a modest impact on the observed trends in reattachment and shear-layer interactions between the cylinders.",56,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056333,"The unsteady flows produced by consecutively pulsed, transient jets were studied using time-resolved particle image velocimetry, where two successive volumes of fluid were ejected from a nozzle into a quiescent fluid. Previous work has shown that the flows from double-pulsed jets persist to much longer times than the equivalent single-pulsed jets, suggesting powerful fluid dynamic interactions between the two ejection events. The transient jets had an exit Reynolds number of 1500 based on the nozzle diameter. The interactions between the jets was found to change significantly with the time separation between the two ejections. The instantaneous velocity distributions showed that, for shorter time intervals between the ejections, the second starting vortex was not completely formed, which was the primary difference from an individually pulsed jet. The increased momentum flux and turbulent wake of the first ejection was found to stabilize the near the flowfield of the double-pulsed jet at shorter pulse intervals by eliminating the starting vortex structure.",56,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055891,"The present study conducted improved delayed detached-eddy simulations of actively controlled flows with a harmonic actuation on a backward-facing step and pulsed blowing on a pitching airfoil for reattachment and separation controls. Spectra analyses based on the unexcited flowfield data were carried out by using dynamic mode decomposition to identify spatial structures corresponding to the different Strouhal frequencies. The characteristic physical modes have been extracted for both cases. With better understanding of unsteady flow features, effective control practices were illustrated. For the backward-facing step case, the optimal excitation frequency was found to be identical with the step-mode frequency of the baseline flow. Such harmonic actuation enhanced the pairing process, forming the largest-scale spanwise coherent structures in the free shear layer, resulting in a 40% maximum reduction of the bubble length. For the airfoil case, with the optimum excitation frequency determined by the vortex-shedding mode of the baseline flow, a 194% increase of the lift-to-drag ratio was obtained; the pulsed blowing with the jet orifices in an antiphased manner was found to be very effective to damp the fluctuations of the lift around its mean value, though it led to a small decrease in mean lift.",56,4

The Reynolds number , based on the nozzle diameter of the main jet, is from 5700 to 13,300. It has been demonstrated that this system may obtain rapidly and simultaneously the optimum excitation frequency and mass flow rate of the minijet, thus achieving the maximum decay rate of the jet centerline mean velocity, as confirmed by the open-loop control results. This technique is robust to the parametric uncertainty with respect to within the tested range and adaptable when the initial control parameters are varied. It has been further found that the maximum remains the same, be it a decrease or increase in , that is, the control performance is essentially independent of .",56,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055272,"Modification of the flow separation characteristics of a laminar airfoil using a remotely located high-power laser was experimentally investigated in a low-speed, low-turbulence wind tunnel. A laminar airfoil model (chord length of 500 mm) was designed and fabricated to emulate the flight characteristics of a small aircraft. At 0 deg angle of attack, the airfoil model was determined to have an incipient laminar separation bubble on its lifting surface between 67 and 80% chord. A strong laser-induced breakdown was generated 2 mm upstream of the leading edge by focusing a collimated beam emitted from a 900 mW laser at 1064 nm through a convex lens. The high-temperature plasma generates a shock wave and a cell of heated air that travels along the airfoil lifting surface and interacts with the boundary-layer flow. Two-component particle image velocimetry was used to map the transient and steady-state flow. The hot, low-density fluid induced significant exchange of momentum between the freestream and the incipient separation zone, leading to reattached flow for a period lasting seven orders of magnitude longer than the plasma lifetime. These results show promise that laser-based energy-deposition approaches can be used for effective flow-control applications.",56,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056122,"Use of microsurface features such as riblets within turbulent boundary layers has proved to be an effective means of friction drag reduction. This paper proposes an effective and efficient methodology for riblet optimization for the complete mission profile with varying speed and altitude. An altitude-correction method was first developed that provided an efficient method for the prediction of drag-reduction ratios for different altitude with much fewer computational fluid dynamics solutions. The method built on data obtained from a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation with the turbulence model. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes results have been validated against experimental data for a flat plate with V-shaped grooves. Such a procedure was combined with a genetic algorithm and response surface models to obtain a riblet configuration with optimal drag reduction for the complete mission profile. Compared to traditional single-point optimization, an additional improvement of 1.53% (increasing by 20.8 from 7.38%) in drag-reduction ratio could be achieved with this method. The results presented here could provide significant practical engineering value for the riblet design for flight vehicles with a wide range of varying operating conditions.",56,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056134,"This paper describes the comparison of a semi-empirical wind turbine noise prediction code to a large volume of acoustic data gathered on a full-scale 2.3 MW wind turbine. Particular focus is placed on the turbulent inflow noise model due to the relatively small amount of validation that has been performed previously. Two novel techniques are developed in order to effectively validate the model. The first is that the turbulence is characterized in the acoustic model using a single quantity, the turbulence dissipation rate, instead of the combination of turbulence intensity and integral length scale as has been used in previous studies. The second development is a method of measuring the turbulence dissipation rate using blade-mounted accelerometers such that the turbulence dissipation rate in the vicinity of the blade is accurately determined. Using these methods, it is shown that the flat-plate airfoil analytical turbulence noise model underpredicts the turbulent inflow noise levels by 3–5 dB, whereas semi-empirical corrections for finite-thickness airfoils reduce prediction errors to less than 3 dB. Comparisons are also made on the basis of scaling with blade tip-speed, scaling with turbulence dissipation rate, and noise directivity.",56,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056324,"Several blade-stacking strategies exist for low-pressure axial fans with potential benefits with respect to the aeroacoustic sound emission. In this study, the impact of such different blade-stacking strategies (including single-type and combined-skewed fan blades) on the fan characteristic curves, aerodynamic properties, and aeroacoustic properties was investigated. It was found that the fan aerodynamic and acoustic characteristic curves are strongly governed by the type of fan blade skew in the outer part of the fan blade. This was also observed for the flow-field on the suction side and on the pressure side. Sound pressure spectra and beamforming sound maps of the fans were further studied for one representative point in the typical fan operating range. The spectra showed similar tendencies as the fan characteristic curves, with spectra progressions being mainly dependent on the type of fan blade skew in the outer part of the fan blade. The sound maps revealed that, for the most part, sound sources are located in the outer fan region but that source characteristics may still be different for single-type and combined-skewed fans. These findings can be further used for reducing the sound emission of low-pressure axial fans with a focus on the fan blade shape in the outer part of the fan blade.",56,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056710,"This paper presents a physical low-order model for two-dimensional unsteady transonic airfoil flow, based on small unsteady disturbances about a known steady flow solution. This is in contrast to traditional small-disturbance theory, which assumes small disturbances about the freestream. The states of the low-order model are the flowfield’s lowest moments of vorticity and volume-source density perturbations, and their evolution equation coefficients are calibrated using off-line unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulations through dynamic mode decomposition. The resulting low-order unsteady flow model is coupled to a typical-section structural model, thus enabling prediction of transonic flutter onset for wings with moderate to high aspect ratios. The method is fast enough to permit incorporation of transonic flutter constraints in conceptual aircraft design calculations. The accuracy of this low-order model is demonstrated for forced pitching and heaving simulations of an airfoil in compressible flow. Finally, the model is used to describe the influence of compressibility on the flutter boundary, and its accuracy is demonstrated for the Isogai Case A classical flutter test case.",56,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056128,"The Applied Aerodynamics Technical Committee of AIAA launched an optimization discussion group, the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group, in 2013. One of the four benchmark test cases is based on the NACA 0012 airfoil and solutions of the Euler equations with prescribed objective function and geometric constaints. Volunteer participants were invited by ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab to submit their optimized shapes for uniform pressure drag assessment through grid convergence. The assessment required three phases. Initial investigations with a simple protocol proved insufficient and raised some questions. This led to further investigations, which showed that, for most optimized airfoils, there exists a lower drag branch and a higher drag branch in the drag (Mach number) diagram. Hysteresis was observed when performing a downward Mach number sweep and an upward Mach number sweep. For several airfoils, the design Mach number falls within the overlap range of the two branches, which indicates that two solutions may exist for the same airfoil. Two kinds of supersonic flow structure can be distinguished. One kind produces a lower drag branch and the other a higher drag branch. The jump from one branch to the other involves nonsymmetrical converged solutions. These further investigations required a final assessment, where a protocol was instituted to ensure that the lower drag branch was captured by taking advantage of the hysteresis. However, nonuniqueness may confound an optimization algorithm because the same set of design variables can give two different objective function values.",56,4

Some mesh movement methods are more robust or of higher quality, whereas others can be more efficient for calculating mesh sensitivity. It is found that a nonconsistent approach gives comparable results when compared to a consistent approach. Therefore, an appropriate combination of nonconsistent approaches can be achieved for efficient adjoint optimization. This paper investigates and compares various consistent and nonconsistent combinations by using linear elasticity, Delaunay graph mapping, and radial basis function mesh movement methods. An investigation is presented, using a lift-constrained drag minimization, to assess which step of the chain introduces a deviation, if any, and to which degree this affects the final result.",56,4

The first is assumed to be a perfectly mixed flow of core and fan streams operating at a nozzle pressure ratio of 4.25 and the second is the tertiary stream operating at a nozzle pressure ratio of 1.89. Above the aft deck, the two unmixed streams merge into the jet plume. Complementary simulation and experimental data were acquired for this geometry. Simulation data were obtained using the Naval Research Laboratory’s (NRL’s) jet engine noise reduction (JENRE) code. Experimental data were gathered in the Syracuse University anechoic chamber. The experimental and computational approaches provided similar results, giving confidence in both the simulation and the newly modified test facility.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056344,"The structure and unsteadiness characteristics of a shock train in a constant-area ducted flow are studied experimentally as a function of duct back pressure, which is mechanically controlled by a valve. Increasing the back pressure pushes the shock train upstream where the approach conditions (including Mach number and boundary-layer momentum thickness) are different, as these quantities vary along the duct length. Despite nominally constant boundary conditions during a run, the shock train fluctuates about its time-averaged position. Schlieren imaging reveals that the unsteadiness characteristics, including the fluctuation amplitude and frequency content, are independent of back pressure. However, changes in the Mach stem length and shock angles demonstrate that the leading shock structure transitions from oblique to normal as back pressure increases. Time-averaged pressure profiles show that the shock train length decreases and the pressure rise across the shock train increases during this process, but these quantities are nominally constant when normalized by the approach conditions. Finally, stereo particle image velocimetry is used to study the three-dimensional structure of a normal leading shock. The velocity fields show a large separation region on the side-wall of the duct and a degree of axisymmetry that indicates a nominally conical shock structure.",56,4

Here, a cylinder-induced shock-wave/transitional boundary-layer interaction is investigated using high-speed Schlieren imaging collected at 100 kHz. The cylinder-induced shock-wave/transitional boundary-layer interaction occurred on a flat plate model in a Mach 1.78 flow upstream of a 3.2-mm-diam cylinder model, which was positioned at 15 unique locations between 6–25 cylinder diameters downstream of the flat plate leading edge. Using the Schlieren images, the positions of the upstream influence shock, forward lambda shock, and trailing lambda shock were tracked in a time-resolved manner, permitting a detailed analysis of cylinder-induced shock-wave/transitional boundary-layer interaction dynamics. A spectral analysis of the Schlieren images showed energy peaks in the separated flow region over a band between 2–6 kHz for the transitional interactions, with peaks coinciding with the location of the lambda shocks for the turbulent interactions. This analysis, coupled with the calculation of disturbance convection velocities for the cylinder-induced shock-wave/transitional boundary-layer interaction cases, suggests that the unsteadiness in the interactions investigated in the present study was driven by the instability in the separated flow region.",56,4

The predominant reaction during supercritical pyrolytic cracking was carbon–carbon bond cleavage to form the primary products of cyclopentadiene and cyclopentene. In contrast, the predominant reaction during supercritical catalytic cracking was the formation of secondary products such as naphthalene and substituted indenes from primary products via molecular growth reactions. Turnover frequencies for the cracking of JP-10 over H-Y under supercritical conditions were obtained and used to determine the apparent activation of JP-10 cracking over H-Y . Atmospheric microflow tube reactor results were obtained to better understand the flow residence time and transport effects, and they showed that catalytic cracking slightly decreased the endothermic cooling capacity as compared to pyrolytic cracking at similar levels of conversion.

As a result, numerous new aircraft shapes have been proposed, but the basic structural layout of wings has remained mostly unchanged for decades. Today, progress in manufacturing techniques and the advent of disruptive technologies such as additive manufacturing in general and 3D printing in particular have opened the door for conceiving more sophisticated layouts of built-up wings. However, due to its many-queries nature, the optimization of a wing structural layout is difficult to perform experimentally, but can be conveniently simulated numerically. To this effect, this paper presents an approach for laying out the internal structure of a wing and a corresponding numerical optimization framework for supporting it. A key component of this approach is a parameterization scheme for the structural members that draws inspiration from nature. It enables the modeling of a vast array of topological structures using a limited number of parameters. Furthermore, it can be easily implemented in a given model generator, interfaced with high-fidelity flow solvers and structural analyzers, and incorporated in a global multidisciplinary optimization framework. This overall framework is discussed in this paper and illustrated with the solution of several aeroelastic analysis and optimization problems at various cruise conditions and aerodynamic load factors.",56,4
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056629,"This paper explores a new design for an airfoil whose chordwise bending stiffness varies with direction of applied load. By designing the region aft of the spar to be very stiff under upward load, uncommanded camber deformation under aerodynamic pressure can be minimized. At the same time, lower stiffness under reversed load reduces actuation requirement to achieve a desired downward camber deformation. Rigid cantilevers extending from the rear of the spar toward the trailing edge, and flush with the lower skin are used to realize this goal. Under upward load the rigid cantilever engages and supplements the chordwise bending stiffness. But under downward load the lower skin breaks contact with the cantilever, and camber deformation can be achieved at low actuation effort. From two-dimensional ABAQUS™ finite element simulations an upward-to-downward stiffness ratio of 13.82 was obtained with a cantilever extending over the entire length of the conformable section, but the maximum downward camber deflection was limited to 10 deg. Reducing the cantilever length reduced the stiffness ratio but allowed higher maximum camber deformations. A three-dimensional prototype was fabricated using “moderate-length” cantilevers and the measured stiffness ratio (under upward-to-downward loading) was determined to be 5.12. The corresponding stiffness ratio from a three-dimensional ABAQUS finite-element simulation was found to be within 6% of experimental results.",56,4

The adopted formulation, which only has displacements as degrees of freedom, allows these models to easily be connected to each other; that is, a variable kinematics model can be derived without ad hoc techniques. The refined models used in the present paper ensure high accuracy and low computational costs. The displacement continuity at the interface is guaranteed by the formulation, and no stress singularities appear in the kinematic model transition. The mixed interpolation tensorial component approach has been used, in a unified sense, for one-, two-, and three-dimensional models to avoid the shear locking effect. The accuracy of the present approach has been confirmed by comparing the results with those from the literature and with those obtained using commercial finite element codes. The static response of a reinforced panel and a section of an aircraft fuselage have been investigated to show the capabilities of the present approach. The use of refined structural models makes it possible to overcome the limits of classical structural models and, at the same time, to reduce the computational costs.",56,4

This investigation finds 1) the initial curvature along the length of the tube has little effect on coil radius, however, the coil has a distinct barrel shape; 2) highly enclosed and 3) highly curved cross-sections result in higher edge strains of the second equilibrium, enabling identification of practical bistable tubes; and 4) conversely, the greater the initial curvature along the length of the tube, the lower the second equilibrium strain.",56,4
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056746,"The hoop truss structure is an indispensable structure of communication satellite antennas. Because the hoop truss structure can deform and seriously vibrate, a ground test is essential before application. This paper first introduces an active suspension method of lifting the structure. Voice coil actuators are used to output an Ampére force that balances the gravity of the structure. Under the condition that the two damped frequencies of the suspension structure and no-suspension structure are equal to each other, the active suspension method is available on the ground. Active vibration control is then investigated to suppress vibration responses. According to a proportional-plus-derivative algorithm and fuzzy algorithm, the control force is calculated and generated by another voice coil actuator. Finally, excitation and closed-loop control experiments are conducted to suppress the nod mode vibration under transient excitation and steady-state excitation. Experimental results show that the actuator effectively suppresses the nod mode vibration of the hoop truss structure.",56,4
