Upon impact, nucleation is assumed to occur instantaneously, and properties of the droplet are chosen to account for the nucleation process. Simulations are performed in ANSYS Fluent using a coupled volume-of-fluid and level-set method to capture the air–water interface, and an enthalpy-porosity method is used to capture the liquid–solid interface. Calibration of a simulation parameter is performed in order to match experimental data for different ideal surface types and surface temperatures. The simulation strategy successfully predicts the overall droplet response for several droplet impact conditions.",53,7
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053513,"A numerical study on the combustion behavior of an inlet-fueled three-dimensional nonuniform-compression scramjet is presented. This paper is an extension to previous work on the combustion processes in a premixed three-dimensional nonuniform-compression scramjet, where thermal compression was shown to enhance combustion. This paper demonstrates how thermal compression can be used in a generic scramjet configuration with a realistic fuel-injection method to enhance performance at high flight Mach numbers. Such a scramjet offers an extra degree of freedom in the design process of fixed-geometry scramjets that must operate over a range of flight Mach numbers. In this study, how the combustion processes are affected is investigated, with the added realism of inlet porthole fuel injection. Ignition is established from within a shock-induced boundary-layer separation at the entrance to the combustor. Radicals that form upstream of the combustor within the inlet, from the injection method, enhance combustion. Coupling of the inlet-induced spanwise gradients and thermal compression improves combustion. The results highlight that, although the fuel-injection method imparts local changes to the flow structures, the global flow behavior does not change compared to previous premixed results. This combustion behavior will be reproduced when using other fueling methods that deliver partially premixed fuel and air to the combustor entrance.",53,7
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053514,"In this study, a new method is proposed to improve the accuracy of the grid block interface flux reconstruction (IFR) approach, which was proposed by the present authors previously for numerical simulation using high order finite difference scheme. Not only is the flux at the point on the block interface corrected, but the fluxes at the adjacent points of the interface are also reconstructed with a selected correction function. This improves the accuracy of the IFR method although the biased finite difference scheme is used to compute the spatial derivatives in the interior boundary region. Four problems, including both inviscid and viscous flows, are numerically solved with the developed code to validate the accuracy of the improved IFR method. The validations imply that the new correction approach improves the accuracy of the IFR method and is effective for inviscid and viscous problems with complex geometry.",53,7
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053515,"The potential of active flow control by means of pulsed blowing to counter performance degradation at high angles of attack is demonstrated on a modern civil aircraft outer wing configuration provided by the European aeronautical industry. Flow control actuators are incorporated into the leading edge between the slat edge and the wingtip, where the wing’s slender shape and its high local curvature do not allow for the integration of mechanical leading-edge devices. Surface flow visualization identifies the highly three-dimensional topology of the uncontrolled flow, which is dominated by the slat edge vortex and leading-edge flow separation at high incidence angles. The influence of the varying-momentum coefficient on drag reduction, lift gain, and aerodynamic efficiency is studied, considering force and pressure measurements, as well as flow visualization. Results indicate that a momentum coefficient of suffices to reduce drag by up to 38%, compared to the uncontrolled baseline flow, and to offset aerodynamic performance degradation by 4 deg if the actuation effort is distributed efficiently along the span.",53,7
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053530,"Numerical algorithms and solutions of generalized nonlinear lifting-line theory over an elliptical wing are examined, with emphasis on near/poststall flows. First, a thorough analysis on the circulation-based and angle-of-attack-based correction methods ( and methods, respectively) highlights their respective numerical poststall characteristics. The stability of the method is demonstrated, producing single and multiple solutions in the pre- and poststall regions, respectively. Second, artificial dissipation added to the method is shown to be an effective means of controlling the poststall flow region. Finally, a strongly coupled algorithm is presented, allowing to bypass the interpolation phase via the use of Legendre polynomials. The model sheds light on poststall flow behavior, in agreement with several papers studying formation of stall cell patterns.",53,7
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053504,"The high strength, light weight, and flexibility of fabric protection systems makes them an effective impact mitigation solution in some important engineering applications. Examples include body armor, fan blade containment systems, and orbital debris shielding. Most soft armor protection systems employ a plain weave fabric, suitable for use in flat or slightly curved geometries. However, future fabric protection system designs may employ nonplain weaves to protect highly curved surfaces (such as personnel extremities) or to optimize the performance of protection systems composed of a nonhomogeneous fabric stack. In recent research, the authors developed an improved hybrid particle-element method to simulate the ballistic impact performance of fabric protection systems. The new formulation is the first to address the full range of modeling issues (including penalty-based contact–impact, excessive yarn bending stiffness, and mass or energy discard) that have limited the effectiveness of legacy finite element-based fabric modeling methods for over two decades. Validation simulations modeled three-dimensional perforation dynamics in multilayer fabric stacks, and showed good agreement with new ballistic experiments conducted at three different target-layer counts for two different projectile types and four different weaves.",53,7
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053424,"Recently, the parallel cascade reduced-order modeling approach has been successfully used for the flutter prediction of a two-degree-of-freedom wing section. However, this approach has been less successful when applied to reveal other important aeroelastic phenomena, such as the transonic aeroservoelastic behaviors of a three-dimensional wing with a trailing-edge control surface. Because of the complexity introduced by the forced control-surface deflection, effects of oscillating shock waves, and aerodynamic viscosity, the stability of the dynamic linear parts of the parallel cascade reduced-order model cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, a novel, stable representation of the parallel cascade reduced-order model is explored in which the linear part is identified by using a predictor-based subspace scheme. To demonstrate the performance of the present parallel cascade reduced-order model in modeling the aeroservoelastic behaviors of a three-dimensional wing with a trailing-edge control surface, the Benchmark Active Control Technology wing is used as an illustrative example. The numerical results demonstrate that the parallel cascade reduced-order models are capable of modeling open/closed-loop aeroservoelastic behaviors. Moreover, the effects of the aerodynamic nonlinearity on the dynamic behaviors of the aeroservoelastic systems are investigated always based on the proposed reduced-order model.",53,7
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053516,"Ice-adhesion properties were evaluated for coating systems based on titanium nitride applied via cathodic-arc physical vapor deposition developed for rotorcraft erosion caps. The ice-adhesion strength of titanium nitride and titanium aluminum nitride was determined experimentally and compared to the ice-adhesion strength of uncoated metallic materials currently used on rotor-blade leading-edge caps: stainless steel 430, Inconel 625, and titanium grade 2. Environmental and material parameters were investigated to identify which were most influential on impact ice-adhesion strength. The effects of median volumetric diameter of the cloud droplets, liquid water content of the cloud, ambient temperature, surface roughness, and material grain direction were tested on stainless steel 430. Tests revealed that surface roughness and temperature have the greatest effect on ice-adhesion strength. There was an increase in adhesion strength of 670% from to and 250% increase from 0.61 to . An increase in water-droplet size from 20 to decreased the ice-adhesion strength by 65%. The adhesion strength increased 15% when shear forces were applied 90 deg with respect to the grain direction as compared to a 0 deg loading configuration. Although within the Federal Aviation Regulation Part 25 and Part 29 Appendix C icing envelope for liquid water content, an increase from 0.5 to had a 7% reduction in ice-adhesion strength. A test matrix to evaluate ice-adhesion strength of erosion-resistant materials was developed, investigating the effects of temperature and coating surface roughness. An empirical extrapolation method to predict ice-adhesion strength with varying temperature is presented and validated on metallic materials. To compare the different materials, the adhesion strength was divided by the temperature to eliminate temperature variation in the data. This temperature-adjusted adhesion strength averaged over the tested conditions for the titanium-nitride-based coatings was 32% higher than the uncoated metallic materials. The titanium nitride had the highest average temperature-adjusted adhesion strength of , and titanium grade 2 has the lowest with over all of the test conditions. Titanium aluminum nitride is an ideal coating because it has low ice-adhesion strength at low surface roughness values and will erode much slower than the other coatings.",53,7

A robust high-order-accurate finite difference method was used that was developed during the last 10–15 years. The robustness stems from the fact that the entire numerical procedure, including various kinds of boundary conditions, can be proven stable.

10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053564,"Open cavities exposed to a grazing flow can exhibit large pressure fluctuations, which may result in damage to stores or components carried within a weapon bay. This study investigates the use of passive resonant absorbers based on Helmholtz resonators to attenuate the problematic pressure fluctuations that arise in cavity flows, under both transonic and supersonic conditions. The experimental investigations indicate that resonant arrays can be used to provide attenuation levels of up to 26 dB within a cavity under supersonic conditions. These supersonic designs were based on the properties of transonic devices, which also delivered high attenuation levels, with up to 15 dB attenuation for a single mode at Mach 0.95. A combined configuration with an array installed at both ends of the cavity, under supersonic conditions, provided attenuation levels up to 15 dB for multiple modes simultaneously, as well as a reduction in the broadband noise. This study investigates the attenuation mechanism for these devices, and discusses the effects of the high sound pressure levels, which arise within a resonant cavity, on the operation of the palliatives. A new semi-empirical model for resonant arrays under such acoustic environments is developed, and design guidelines of cavity applications are provided.",53,7
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053568,"A series of water-tunnel experiments were conducted to determine the effect of sinusoidal leading-edge protuberances on the aerodynamic characteristics of finite span wings. The models consisted of seven rectangular planform wings, two swept-leading-edge wings, and two wings with a planform resembling humpback-whale flippers. All models had an underlying NACA profile with protuberance amplitudes of 0.025–0.12 times the chord length. The models were examined at Reynolds numbers up to and angles of attack up to 30 deg. The lift and drag coefficients were nearly independent of Reynolds numbers above . Specific rectangular-planform models had appreciably greater lift coefficients over a limited angle-of-attack range when compared to the baseline model. However, with the exception of the planform that resembled the humpback-whale flipper, the lift-to-drag ratio of all leading-edge modified models was comparable to or less than the equivalent baseline model. The flipper model had a slightly smaller drag coefficient than its baseline counterpart from 17 to 21 deg. The drag of all other models examined was equal to or greater than the corresponding baseline for the entire angle-of-attack range examined. The presence of leading-edge protuberances reduced the span efficiency of the rectangular-planform wings when compared to the baseline, and the primary parameter affecting the span efficiency was the protuberance amplitude.",53,7
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053581,"The near-field and acoustic far-field response of an unheated Mach 0.9 jet with Reynolds number was investigated. The study included both the baseline and controlled jets utilizing plasma actuators. Simultaneous acquisition of the near- and far-field signals with the actuation phase enabled the use of phase averaging to reconstruct the signature of the large-scale coherent structures generated by excitation of instabilities in the shear layer of the jet. Decomposition of the near-field pressure into its constitutive hydrodynamic and acoustic fields is accomplished via the application of a filter in the frequency/wave-number domain. The results showed that both the hydrodynamic and acoustic response to excitation for Strouhal numbers less than 0.50 could be well predicted by a simple linear superposition of the impulse response of the jet. The results appear to indicate that the dominant acoustic radiation reaching the far-field aft angles is being generated over an extended region of the jet mixing layer: the upstream portion of the jet, just before the end of the potential core, with highly temporally intermittent bursts occurring downstream of the potential core. Significantly lower temporal coherency of the acoustic response was found when compared to the hydrodynamic response. Finally, excitation for , which produces coherent interactions between the generated large-scale structures, was found to increase the temporal coherency of the acoustic response.",53,7
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053535,"Three model problems associated with aerodynamic drag minimizations are studied. These test cases have been proposed by the aerodynamic design optimization discussion group, and they include an inviscid NACA0012 nonlifting airfoil, a viscous RAE2822 lifting airfoil, and a viscous lifting wing based on the NASA Common Research Model. Various optimization methods are used, including MDOPT, TRANAIR, SYN83, and SYN107. The resulting designed and associated baseline geometries are cross analyzed by several computational fluid dynamics codes, including OVERFLOW, TRANAIR, GGNS, and FLO82. Pathological issues are unveiled in both of the simple airfoil model problems. Designed geometries for the inviscid symmetric test case exhibit strong tendencies to permit nonsymmetric flow solutions. Designed airfoils for the viscous lifting case also support nonunique solutions and hysteresis loops at or near the design point in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and integral boundary-layer method simulations. These results provide further evidence that single-point aerodynamic optimization is often ill posed. In extreme cases, it can yield designs with very undesirable aerodynamic characteristics, at least as analyzed by Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and integral boundary-layer methods occurring at offdesign, and even ondesign, conditions. These examples are used to further document the multiple-solution and pseudosolution phenomena for steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes. This provides evidence that, even in practical engineering settings, numerical methods to assess stability and uniqueness of steady-state solutions and/or predict the bifurcations of these solutions have value. The single-point wing design problem is likewise ill posed in the spanwise direction. A multipoint design with a potentially large number of points or the inclusion of inequality constraints can regularize the problem.",53,7
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053584,"A novel alteration to the Cauchy–Kowalevski procedure is here presented to obtain essentially monotonic solutions for multidimensional flows. It is argued that this can be accomplished by splitting the cross-derivative terms among the several dimensions, such that the coefficient of the cross derivatives remains small compared to the coefficient of the normal derivatives. The approach naturally lends itself to extending the Roe flux difference splitting scheme to multiple dimensions and is advantaged over previous Cauchy–Kowalevski-based methods by yielding a solution free of spurious oscillations in the vicinity of oblique shock waves. Several test cases ranging from low-speed subsonic flows in channels to hypersonic flows over ramp injectors indicate that the proposed genuinely multidimensional method generally achieves a twofold or more increase in resolution along each dimension over the dimensionally split Roe scheme while retaining its appealing attributes: the scheme has a compact three-node-bandwidth stencil, is a finite volume flux function, yields essentially monotonic solutions, introduces minimal dissipation within viscous layers, and is written in general matrix form. Although the method proposed is first-order accurate, it offers a resolution as high or higher than the dimensionally split second-order total-variation-diminishing schemes for many problems of interest and is expected to surpass significantly the latter when extended to second-order accuracy.",53,7
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053585,"Influences of heat release by the hydrogen combustion in supersonic turbulent boundary layers are numerically studied using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The adopted Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes methodology is first validated by comparing the numerical results with the existing experimental data. Studies on the effects of the flame perpendicular position inside the boundary layer reveal that, while the flame is restricted around the edge of the boundary layer, the heat release may slightly reduce rather than increase the wall heat flux because of the suppression effect on the turbulent energy transport due to heat release. However, as the flame moves toward the wall, the skin-friction reduction effect would not be obviously strengthened, but the wall heat flux could be dramatically enhanced by the increase of near-wall chemical reactions. At a given hydrogen mass flow rate, the injection scheme with a higher injection height and a lower injection velocity could be helpful to achieve a larger skin-friction reduction while maintaining a lower wall heat flux. Finally, analysis of the heat-release effects on the velocity law of the wall shows that van Driest’s velocity law largely deviates from the computational results, whereas White’s velocity law remains close to the numerical results within a region of approximately .",53,7
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053556,"A novel iterative learning control algorithm was developed and applied to an active flow control problem. The technique used pulsed air jets applied to a trailing-edge flap to enhance the lift. The iterative learning control algorithm used position-based pressure measurements to update the actuation. The method was experimentally tested on a two-element high-lift wing in a low-speed wind tunnel. Compressed air and fast switching solenoid valves were used as actuators to excite the flow, and the pressure distribution around the chord of the wing was measured as a feedback control signal for the iterative learning controller. Experimental results showed that the actuation was able to delay the separation and increase the overall lift by over the angle of attack range and increase from 2.7 to 3.0 compared to the nonactuated case. By using the iterative learning control algorithms, the controller was able to track the target lift, and by using an optimum control algorithm with an extended reference, the controller was able to maximize the lift enhancement.",53,7
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053588,"A transonic flow over the OAT15A supercritical profile is considered. The interaction between the shock wave and the turbulent boundary layer is investigated through numerical simulation and global stability analysis for a wide range of angles of attack. Numerical simulations are in good agreement with previous studies and manage to reproduce the high-amplitude self-sustained shock oscillations known as shock buffet. In agreement with previous results, it is found that the buffet phenomenon is driven by an unstable global mode of the linearized Navier–Stokes equations. Analysis of the adjoint global mode reveals that the flow is most receptive to harmonic forcings on the suction side of the profile, within the boundary layer upstream of the shock foot, in the recirculation bubble downstream of the shock foot, and on the right characteristic that impinges the shock foot. An eigenvalue sensitivity analysis shows that a steady streamwise force applied either in the boundary layer or in the recirculation region, a steady cooling of the boundary layer, or a steady source of eddy viscosity (a mechanical vortex generator for example) all lead to stabilization of the buffet mode. Finally, pseudoresonance phenomena have been analyzed by performing a singular-value decomposition of the global resolvent, which revealed that, besides the low-frequency shock unsteadiness, the flow also undergoes medium-frequency unsteadiness, linked to Kelvin–Helmholtz-type instability. Such results are reminiscent of the medium-frequency perturbations observed in more traditional shock wave/boundary-layer interactions.",53,7
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053594,"A computational-fluid-dynamics-driven robust and accurate method for aerodynamic shape optimization, previously developed by the authors, is further enhanced by extending it to automatic multipoint design of wing–body–nacelle configurations. The shape is optimized for minimum drag at fixed lift subject to numerous geometrical and aerodynamical constraints. The method, which is driven by genetic algorithms and full Navier–Stokes computations combined with reduced-order models approach, is supported by massive multilevel parallelization. The applications include single- and multipoint aerodynamic designs for a transport-type aircraft configuration. For the considered class of shape optimizations, significant drag reduction in on- and off-design conditions has been achieved. It was also shown that the optimizations, which start from markedly different initial shapes, ultimately converge to optimum shapes very close one to one another. The paper demonstrates how automated techniques based on the developed method have now matured and provide an industrial strength solution.",53,7
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053605,"Wind-tunnel experiments are used to study the effect of momentum coefficient and excitation frequency on flow separation using synthetic jet actuation. Experiments are conducted on a NACA 0025 airfoil at a chord-based Reynolds number of 100,000 and angle of attack of 10 deg. The actuator is located near the leading edge, downstream of the mean separation location. High-frequency excitation is able to reattach the flow and eliminate the large-scale vortex shedding in the wake, leading to a decrease in drag of approximately 45%. Low-frequency excitation is employed to target the instabilities associated with the separated shear layer and vortex shedding in the wake. Excitation of the wake instability also causes the flow to reattach; however, it leads to organization of the large-scale vortex shedding. By forcing the boundary layer at the frequency of the shear-layer instability, the threshold momentum required to reattach the flow is an order of magnitude smaller as compared with high-frequency excitation, and the large-scale vortex shedding is suppressed.",53,7

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053615,"The effect of nozzle-exit boundary-layer thickness on the evolution of a round Mach 1.3, Reynolds number jet is examined without and with control. For the latter, the flapping mode is considered at the preferred column mode frequency (Strouhal ). The boundary-layer thickness is varied from a very small value to 25% of the diameter. For the no-control cases, the distance between the nozzle lip and the initial appearance of breakdown is proportional to the boundary-layer thickness, which is consistent with theory and previous results by other researchers at Mach 0.9. However, the subsequent growth toward the centerline is faster for the thicker boundary layers. With flapping mode control, increasing the thickness of the boundary layer has different effects on the flapping and nonflapping planes. The rapid spreading of the jet observed on the flapping plane with thin boundary layers is greatly diminished as the nozzle-exit layer is thickened. Conversely, the rate of spreading on the nonflapping plane is increased. Likewise, the characteristic vortical rings observed with thin layers in experiment and simulations become less prominent with thicker layers, indicating reduced control authority. Thus, increasing the boundary-layer thickness reduces the differences between controlled and uncontrolled cases.",53,7
