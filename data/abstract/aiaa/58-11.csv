0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059872,"A stationary wing placed in the wake of a bluff body experiences lift enhancement. The quasi-periodic flow in the wake causes excitation of the separated flow in the poststall conditions. The increase in the time-averaged lift force is associated with the flow separation, leading-edge vortex formation, and subsequent reattachment in a process similar to the dynamic stall of oscillating wings. The lift enhancement is maximum for an optimal offset distance from the wake centerline. At the optimal location, potential flow oscillations, rather than the direct impingement of large vortices in the wake, provide the excitation. The smaller amplitude flow oscillations lead to a large separation bubble in the time-averaged sense in the poststall regime. The delayed flow separation in the wake has a similar mechanism and frequency to those of the active flow control methods for separation. The degree of the lift enhancement is remarkable, given that the wake at a Reynolds number of 50,000 is expected to be highly three-dimensional.",58,11
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059492,"Simulations are reported on the behavior of two tandem symmetric foils in an in-line configuration undergoing pitching motion. The Reynolds number was varied between 1000 and 4000, whereas the pitching Strouhal number ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 and the amplitude of pitching varied from 4 to 8 deg. The streamwise separation distance between the foils was fixed at one chord length. The performance of the downstream foil was significantly worsened (up to 80% in efficiency) by the tandem effects. The Strouhal number, Reynolds number, and pitching amplitude had substantial impact on the performance of the downstream foil. For the upstream foil, however, the performance improved by up to 147% in efficiency at all ranges of Reynolds number, Strouhal number, and pitching amplitude. The scaling of the individual foil performance metric and the system collective performance metric were investigated for tandem foils. The scaling developed for isolated foils does hold for tandem foils in the in-line configuration with modified empirical coefficients that depend on reduced frequency and Reynolds number in a range of and . However, the leading foil behavior at lower is more scattered compared to higher , which suggests more significant wake interactions that influence the scaling and performance of the leading foil.",58,11
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059068,"A NACA 0018 airfoil in freestream velocity is oscillated in longitudinal, transverse, and angle-of-attack directions with respect to the freestream velocity, known as surge, plunge, and pitch. The lift-based equivalence method introduces phase shifts between these three motions to construct in-phase sinusoidal components for maximum lift, waveform construction. Lift cancellation is also determined with the exact negative pitch and plunge motion amplitudes found from the equivalence method to achieve out-of-phase wave destruction. Lift cancellation occurs when a combination of these motions is sought to obtain a constant lift magnitude throughout the oscillation cycle. To achieve both equivalence and cancellation of lift, a prescribed pure pitch amplitude through the Theodorsen theory equates the corresponding equivalent plunge amplitude and pitch–plunge phase shift. These Theodorsen, linear superposition findings of pitch–plunge are leveraged toward the Greenberg theory to determine a closed-form, surge–pitch–plunge solution through the addition of a surge–plunge phase shift and optimal surge amplitude for lift cancellation. The lift cancellation surge–pitch–plunge amplitudes define the equivalence amplitude investigated here and theoretically limit the experiment to combinations of the first lift harmonic of the Greenberg theory. The analytical results are then compared with experimental lift force measurements and dye visualization. The normalized lift differences due to unsteady wake and boundary-layer behavior are examined to explore the extents of the Greenberg theory for these cases of lift-based equivalence and cancellation.",58,11
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059141,"We numerically investigate the propulsion performance of a skeleton-reinforced caudal fin with both active and passive control mechanisms. In our fluid–structure interaction model, the embedded rays are depicted as nonlinear beams while the flow is simulated using a Navier–Stokes solver. Kinematically, the fin is activated by a sway motion at the basal ends of the rays and distributed time-varying forces along each ray individually. The dynamics of the fin is closely associated with the exact distribution of phase lags (between the sway motion and external forces) among the rays. We find that the fin’s performance can be significantly enhanced by active control when the mean phase lag is less than 90 deg. Among different deformation patterns, the cupping deformation ( mode) produces the best propulsion performance and the W-shape deformations ( mode) have a similar (yet less pronounced) effect. Asymmetric deformations such as the heterocercal mode ( mode) and undulation mode ( mode) are able to generate vertical forces. Compared with the mode, the mode creates less thrust force, but it significantly reduces the transverse force, making it more suitable in cases when there is no other mechanism to balance this transverse force (for example, during the braking maneuver).",58,11

By controlling flow separation, higher propeller efficiency and improved performance might be possible. In this paper a bioinspired passive flow control strategy that improves propeller performance is used by introducing protuberances, or tubercles, in the leading-edge region of a propeller blade. Experiments also revealed apparent improvements to propeller acoustic emissions. Propeller performance and noise signatures, evaluated against a reference propeller, are presented from experiments involving different propeller configurations modified with various combinations of tubercle geometry. Specific tubercle configurations exhibit improvements in efficiency up to 6% as well as redistributed directional and high-frequency broadband noise characteristics.",58,11
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058308,"When modeling wind turbine wake recovery, the location of wake breakdown plays a crucial role. The breakdown is caused by a rapid deformation of the helical near-wake vortex structure that is triggered by the pairing of successive blade tip vortices. In this paper, the capability of a cost-efficient lifting-line free vortex wake code to accurately predict the wake breakdown location and its underlying mechanisms is demonstrated and validated against simulation results of a large-eddy simulation solver and additional data from the literature. Furthermore, this work investigates a technique to accelerate the breakdown of wind turbine wakes. The onset of wake breakdown is caused by perturbations that travel along the helical structure of the wake and grow via mutual-induction interaction between neighboring vortex filaments. To accelerate wake breakdown, the blade tip vortices are perturbed at different frequencies via trailing-edge flaps located in the outboard region of the rotor blades. Through the evaluation of the perturbation growth rates and the analysis of velocity fields, it is shown that for a multi-megawatt wind turbine operating in a turbulent wind field, the wake breakdown position can be significantly affected by a moderate flap actuation amplitude if excited at an appropriate frequency.",58,11
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059414,"The exergy method is a powerful tool for aerodynamic analysis and drag prediction. However, its formulation still requires further improvements in order to obtain a useful drag breakdown for the analysis of wind-tunnel data (like the far-field methods). The far-field drag breakdown is achieved by using a velocity decomposition technique, but the related formulation is not well suited for the exergy method. Thus, the main objective of this work is to develop a new velocity decomposition suited for the exergy analysis and to propose a related exergy-based drag breakdown formulation for wind-tunnel applications.",58,11
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058944,"Natural laminar-flow wings are one of the most promising technologies for reducing fuel burn and emissions for commercial aviation. However, there is a lack of tools for performing shape optimization of wings based on computational fluid dynamics considering laminar-to-turbulent transition. To address this need, we develop a discrete adjoint-based optimization framework where transition is modeled. The core of this framework is a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver that is coupled with a simplified method to predict Tollmien–Schlichting and laminar separation-induced transition that consists of a laminar boundary-layer code and a database method for flow stability analysis. The transition prediction is integrated with a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model through a smoothed intermittency function, which makes it suitable for gradient-based optimization. A coupled-adjoint approach that uses transpose Jacobian-vector products derived via automatic differentiation computes the transition prediction derivatives. Lift-constrained drag minimizations of airfoils for a single-point design and a multipoint design problem are performed. The results show that the optimizer successfully reduces the drag coefficient by increasing the extent of laminar flow. The multipoint optimization formulation produces an airfoil with a significant amount of laminar flow that is maintained at several flight conditions. The proposed methods make it possible to perform aerodynamic shape optimization considering laminar-to-turbulent transition in airfoil optimization.",58,11
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059317,"Global optimization of aerodynamic shapes usually requires a large number of expensive computational fluid dynamics simulations because of the high dimensionality of the design space. One approach to combat this problem is to reduce the design space dimension by obtaining a new representation. This requires a parametric function that compactly and sufficiently describes useful variation in shapes. This paper proposes a deep generative model, Bézier-GAN, to parameterize aerodynamic designs by learning from shape variations in an existing database. The resulted new parameterization can accelerate design optimization convergence by improving the representation compactness while maintaining sufficient representation capacity. The airfoil design is used as an example to demonstrate the idea and analyze Bézier-GAN’s representation capacity and compactness. Results show that Bézier-GAN both 1) learns smooth and realistic shape representations for a wide range of airfoils and 2) empirically accelerates optimization convergence by at least two times compared with state-of-the-art parameterization methods.",58,11
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059325,"Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) is commonly performed using surrogates to approximate the response due to deterministic and stochastic design variables, as well as random parameters, but is ultimately limited by the number of dimensions that can be accurately represented. In this paper, a new surrogate-centric RBDO formulation is developed to alleviate the computational expense of excessive random parameters. Nondeterministic kriging nonstationary variation estimation is used to characterize normally distributed random parameters and numerical noise rather than increasing the surrogate’s dimensionality. Simultaneously, surrogate-based uncertainty propagation is performed considering the nonnormally distributed or high nonlinear random parameters, and stochastic design variables. In this study, propagated uncertainties and the uncertainty captured by the kriging variation are recombined through the convolution of the two probability density functions. It was found that conglomerations of normally distributed random parameters allow this method to reduce the number of approximated spaces while maintaining accuracy compared to existing surrogate approaches. This paper contains a detailed description of the proposed methodology; foundational four-, five-, and six-dimensional RBDO examples with comparisons to previous methods from the literature; and the RBDO of a 10-dimensional nonlinear thermoelastic hat-stiffened panel under a frequency and stress constraint.",58,11
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059227,"Sound pressure level (SPL) is one of the significant parameters of the acoustic–structure coupling for the elastic wave metamaterial. This paper presents the use of the external mean flow and the active feedback control system. Based on the locally resonant mechanism, the dynamic effective mass density is also discussed and the negative density appears at a lower frequency region. From the results, it can be seen that both the SPL and the effective mass density can be controlled by the active feedback system. As the frequency region of the negative density increases obviously, it emerges two negative regions with the changing of the displacement feedback control action and leads to the changing of the SPL. Besides the Mach number of the external mean flow, other influences on the SPL are also discussed, such as the structural damping, lattice constants, excitation position, elevation angle, and azimuth angle. Finally, these interesting effects on the elastic wave metamaterial are presented and explored.",58,11
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059208,"This work proposes a multifidelity modeling approach for predicting aeroelastic flutter of airfoils and wings. Using aerodynamic models based on the doublet-lattice method and time-accurate Euler equations, cokriging-based surrogates of the generalized aerodynamic influence coefficients are generated as functions of Mach number and reduced frequency. The surrogate-based matrix terms are then used in the method to determine flow conditions at flutter onset. To demonstrate the multifidelity process, a widely used pitching and plunging airfoil case is considered. Verification of the approach is done by comparing with results from a mode-based time-domain aeroelastic solver, as well as data from the literature. The approach draws inspiration from Timme et al., but focuses more on widely used industry tools (namely, the method, panel-based aerodynamics, and time-domain computational fluid dynamics). The benefit of using multiple aerodynamic fidelities, rather than high-fidelity kriging models, is also quantified by examining a flutter speed error metric as the number of high-fidelity samples is varied.",58,11
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059388,"Thermal residual stresses can have a substantial impact on the bond-line fatigue of wind-turbine blades and the initiation of tunneling cracks in the adhesive layer early in their operational life. Thermal residual stresses develop during the manufacture of the blade as a consequence of the temperature difference between the curing conditions and the operating environmental conditions. Polymers are used as adhesive or matrix material for fiber-reinforced materials. Their physical properties (for example, the coefficient of thermal expansion, Young’s modulus, and the tensile strength) depend on the curing process (that is, the degree of cure and the temperature). Moreover, the ambient temperature for the blade during its operational life underlies a statistical distribution, which is site specific. Traditionally, the design evaluation is conducted with material properties obtained at a room temperature of 23°C under fully cured conditions. Taking into account the variability of temperature at a specific site (for example, from to 25°C) will increase the fidelity of the design evaluation. This research investigates the impact of thermal residual stress on the fatigue stress exposure along the trailing-edge bond line during operational blade life. A simplified approach using temperature-independent material properties for different temperature sites at northern, central, and southern European wind farm sites is compared to an advanced approach using temperature-dependent and degree-of-cure-dependent properties. It was found that the advanced approach yields a more critical design.",58,11
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059624,"This work demonstrates the control of the shock-induced separated flow generated by a sharp fin placed on a cylindrical surface (fin-on-cylinder shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction) with an incident Mach 2.5 flow. Well-quantified distortions in the form of streamwise vortices are embedded into the boundary layer using single sub-boundary-layer vortex generators (VGs). At four device heights downstream from the VG trailing edge, the boundary layer exhibits a peak deficit in the streamwise velocity from the undistorted boundary layer of 60%. At 15 device heights, the boundary layer was energized to a peak surplus of 25% in the streamwise velocity. These two VG streamwise placements (four and 15 device heights) were employed to emphasize the impact of direct vortex interactions and boundary-layer energization on separation vortex control. It was found that having an energized boundary-layer incident on the fin-on-cylinder SBLI made very little change to the separation vortex size and the associated pressure distribution. However, placing the vortex generator much closer significantly mitigated the separation vortex size, and several azimuthal placement locations showed an elimination of the separation vortex. Cross-sectional velocity and vorticity fields showed a strong reduction in spanwise velocity and streamwise vorticity above the separation vortex in the successful configurations.",58,11

The constant of the inhomogeneous DGT term is found using planar surface tension values and recent nucleation rate measurements from available literature. Resulting values for the free energy barrier, surface tension, and mean density of critical droplets are used in nucleation and droplet growth rate models to evaluate the condensation process. Good agreement is found between this model and published values for condensation onset in hypersonic wind tunnels, with an average deviation of 2.2 K in static temperature.",58,11
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059429,"A new algorithm for a flush air data sensing (FADS) system was developed to estimate flight data and attitude angles for a sharp-nosed hypersonic vehicle in a framework of a hypersonic flight demonstration project directed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency at the Kakuda Space Center. The design’s target condition is Mach 5.0–7.0 with angles of attack and sideslip within 6°. The FADS system relates air data and pressures from surface-mounted pressure ports on the forebody of the vehicle to generate lookup tables that are used to estimate the angle of attack, freestream Mach number, static pressure, and dynamic pressure. These data are also used to generate an angle-of-sideslip estimate from triples algorithm, which has been well-established for a blunt-nosed body. The estimation algorithm used by the designed FADS system is validated through numerical simulation, which was also used to generate lookup tables and wind tunnel experiments. Results indicated that the designed FADS system can estimate air data within the uncertainty of 6% for freestream conditions and within 0.7° for the angles of attack and sideslip in the range of targeted flight conditions.",58,11
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059365,"A novel method is developed to improve the volume performance of large-slenderness-ratio cone-derived waveriders. Under the consideration of space utilization, loading capacity, and upper wall expansion performance, the design method is composed of an improved basic flowfield and a specially designed M-shaped flow capture curve. In addition, an improved evaluation method is proposed to provide a better measurement of volume performance for large-slenderness-ratio waveriders than the conventional method, which can also guide the design of volume-improved waveriders. The volume-improved waveriders and conventional cone-derived waveriders with slenderness ratios of more than nine are designed under the condition of a cruising altitude of 40 km and a Mach number of 12. After investigating their volume and aerodynamic performance, it can be found that the volume-improved waverider can achieve about a 48% volume increment, a 91% effective volume increment, and a four times larger volume growth rate compared to the conventional waverider. Furthermore, the lift-to-drag ratio of the volume-improved waverider is higher than that of the conventional waverider in the inviscid case, whereas it is smaller under the viscous condition. The gap in the viscous lift-to-drag ratio between the two waveriders reduces with the increasing attack of angle and is less than 8% at the design condition.",58,11
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059072,"Sustained flight at hypersonic speeds presents an enduring challenge to vehicle design and control. An extreme aerothermal environment acting on geometrically thin, multifunctional structures can result in the significant structural response of key aerodynamic surfaces. Specifically, the oscillations of a compression corner shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction, which models a control surface deflection, can couple with the lowest natural frequencies of a proximal compliant surface, leading to a range of undesirable outcomes from reduced service life to structural failure. The present work investigates these phenomena through time-accurate high-fidelity aeroelastic simulations of a laminar two-dimensional flow at over a 35 deg compression ramp featuring an embedded compliant panel. Surface pressure, skin friction, and heat transfer associated with the corner shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction are directly compared between rigid and compliant configurations. The upstream separation zone is observed to synchronize with the compliant-panel deflection. A reduction in surface heat flux is observed for a majority of compliant cases relative to the rigid case, whereas entirely new flow features are observed in response to large-scale panel deflections. A modification is proposed to the local piston-theory aerodynamic model to improve the accuracy of surface pressure predictions.",58,11

One-dimensional and two-dimensional theoretical analyses show that the rotating detonation wave is the source of total pressure gain. The total pressure ratio across the propagating detonation wave depends on the absolute Mach number of fresh reactants and the relative Mach number of the detonation wave. In addition, an equivalent expansion model is developed to evaluate the total pressure gain in an RDE. It is found that the total pressure ratio of RDE is far less than that across the propagating detonation wave. Simultaneously, one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical simulations are carried out to validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis.",58,11
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059217,"This paper develops a new approach for analysis of subgrid closures for turbulent combustion as modeled using direct quadrature (finite-rate chemistry) techniques. The approach, termed multiresolution analysis through mesh-sequenced realizations (MRA-MSR), conducts simultaneous, constrained large-eddy simulations on a set of hierarchically coarsened meshes. The availability of underlying fine-mesh (subgrid) data corresponding to coarse-mesh locations allows a clearer assessment of the effects of unresolved fluctuations on apparent reactivity. A key to MRA-MSR is the correlation of eddy structures at coarser mesh levels, which is facilitated by the transfer of filtered fine-mesh velocity information. A seven-mesh MRA-MSR hierarchy using three resolution levels is applied to one of the Sydney bluff-body stabilized methane–hydrogen flames. Analysis of the simultaneously evolved data at different resolution levels reveals several interesting trends. First, at high Damköhler numbers, there is clear evidence of attenuation of apparent reactivity due to the effects of unresolved fluctuations. Secondly, single-point, single-time filtered density functions of a normalized subgrid Damköhler number show a characteristic beta probability density function (PDF) form and display evidence of scale similarity. Interrogation of the MRA-MSR database also shows that the recently-proposed least-squares minimization (LSM) turbulence–chemistry interaction model can account for the observed diminishment in reactivity at high Damköhler numbers but cannot reduce scatter significantly. A new form of the LSM model, which makes use of the normalized subgrid Damköhler number beta PDF distribution, performs slightly better than the original model, illustrating the potential of MRA-MSR both in assessing existing closure concepts and in developing new ones.",58,11

Given a geometry definition, a simple Cartesian mesh generated through a fully automated process can be used for an immersed boundary method (IBM) since it is a non-body-conformal mesh approach that incorporates geometrical complexities using momentum forcing to enforce its boundary condition onto the flowfield. Detached-eddy simulation is employed for the turbulence modeling, and an appropriate wall function is defined and implemented as needed for efficient high-Reynolds-number computations. Also, it is demonstrated that a total-variation-diminishing reconstruction must be used to produce physically reasonable results. Finally, an actuator surface model is integrated with the IBM solver, concluding the overall IBM–ASM methodology to address rotorcraft problems. Detailed verification and validation of the IBM solver are demonstrated for a low-Reynolds-number cylinder, a turbulent flat plate, and a high-Reynolds-number cylinder. Lastly, the IBM–ASM solver is validated against experimental measurements for the flow around a simplified airframe developed by the Georgia Institute of Technology. Unsteady rotor-wake/fuselage interactions in a forward flight condition are qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Results are competitive with existing best methods using a fraction of the setup and computational effort of the body-conforming method.",58,11
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059276,"The harmonic balance method is nowadays widely applied for numerically solving problems that are known to possess time-periodic solutions. Key reasons for its success are its wide range of applicability, relative ease of implementation, and computational efficiency compared to time-accurate approaches. The computational efficiency of the harmonic balance method is partly derived from the fact that it searches directly for a periodic solution instead of integrating the governing equations in time until a periodic solution is reached. Convergence acceleration techniques such as multigrid, implicit residual smoothing, and local time stepping may also be used to improve the efficiency of the harmonic balance method. This paper considers another option for accelerating convergence, namely, a novel time-level preconditioner that can be applied to the harmonic balance residual locally in each computational cell. The benefit of employing this preconditioner is analyzed both from a theoretical perspective, by performing a rigorous stability analysis based on the linearized Euler equations, and from a numerical perspective, by applying it to two test cases.",58,11
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059461,"Honeycomb sandwich panels are used in aerospace structures for their high stiffness-to-mass ratio. Reducing structural mass is critical in aircraft and spacecraft development due to its direct impact on payload capacity and operational costs. Typically, hexagonal honeycombs manufactured by cold expansion of periodically bonded strips of metal or foils of other materials are used for sandwich construction. With rapid development in additive manufacturing, other core shapes with higher specific stiffness can now be considered as an alternative. The authors of this paper had previously evaluated triangular cores to have higher or comparable specific moduli as compared with other two-dimensional core shapes. Further, the panels constructed using triangular cores had higher stiffness than traditional hexagonal core panels. To consider practical use of the triangular cores, elastic-plastic structural analysis is performed to evaluate the strength and failure of sandwich panel construction. Load bearing capacity of triangular core panels under three-point bending, in-plane compressive loading, and transverse shear loading is evaluated using finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit. The comparison made between triangular core and hexagonal core sandwich panels having the same cell size and relative density showed that triangular cores outperform hexagonal cores for applications where in-plane loading is dominant, whereas, in terms of transverse shear and out-of-plane loading, triangular core panels tend to fail at lower loads and lower deflections.",58,11
