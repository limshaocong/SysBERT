There has been a pressing need for morphing wing skin structures that hold both low in-plane and high out-of-plane stiffness. A design methodology for the gripper pin morphing wing skin is presented here. The torsional and bending resistance mechanisms of the wing skin are presented to demonstrate its performance. The performance of the gripper pin wing skin under the variable camber compliant wing morphing process was estimated using 3D finite element models. According to the 3D finite element analyses, the stress levels of the gripper pin skin are much lower than that of the bulk material skin. The gripper pin wing skin structure has an enormous advantage with regard to the stress level and given its low actuation energy.",57,5

A systematic study of this tagging method is explored through the adjustment of gas pressure, mixture ratio, and laser properties. It is found that the signal strength and lifetime are greatest at low pressures for excitation at both the 400 and 800 nm laser wavelengths. The relative intensities of two spectral peaks in the near-UV emission change as a function of gas pressure and can potentially be used for local pressure measurements. Single-shot precision in pure R134a is demonstrated in quiescent gas. One standard deviation (68%) of the uncertainty lies within of the mean velocity in a 0.1 atm pressure quiescent flow using a delay time of and within using a delay of . The variable parameter space is chosen to mimic conditions used in NASA Langley Research Center’s Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. Good signal-to-noise ratio is achieved for low-pressure conditions, especially in a pure freon environment. The precision and signal lifetime demonstrate the feasibility of using this technique for measuring representative Transonic Dynamics Tunnel flowfields in a bench-top laboratory setting.",57,5

The calibration process, using a set of unsteady pressure sensors, was found to overcome some of the inherent problems of the fast-response paint, such as rapid photodegradation, nonlinearity in pressure response, and significant temperature sensitivity. The large data set exposed various critical transonic flow physics such as a coupling of the shock motion on the payload fairing (PF) with the separated flow region downstream, and an upstream convection of pressure fluctuations on the PF at certain Mach numbers. Area-weighted integration of the pressure fluctuation data provided a measure of the unsteady forces on various parts of the model. The unsteady force coefficients on the PF and the upper stage were the highest when transonic shocks were present and found to reduce significantly when supersonic flow set in. Time histories on a dense, regularly spaced, spatial grid points allowed for the calculation of wavenumber–frequency spectra via Fourier transform. The spectra were dominated by the convected fluctuations; the acoustic domain was not discernible. These data, valuable for the buffet and vibroacoustics analysis of aerospace vehicles, are believed to be the first obtained for the transonic flight regime.",57,5

The flow separation at the end of the main body forms a highly dynamic recirculation region with strong pressure fluctuations on the reattaching surface. The time-averaged reattachment on the rear sting is at 1.05 main body diameters downstream of the step. This work investigates the application of passive flow control devices for their potential of reducing the loads on the space launcher’s nozzle. It is shown that rectangular or circular grooves at the end of the main body force enhanced mixing in the separated shear layer, leading to a reduction of the reattachment length of 55%. Additionally, the fluctuations of the reattachment are significantly reduced, which results in lower-pressure fluctuations and thus reduced dynamic loads.",57,5

The Reynolds number based on the chord was fixed at , corresponding to a freestream velocity of . A single nanosecond dielectric barrier discharge (NS-DBD) plasma actuator was mounted near the leading edge of the airfoil. Natural vortex shedding was measured to be at a Strouhal number of 0.60. Excitation at low Strouhal numbers resulted in organized, large-scale, coherent structures in the shear layer over the separated region with shedding Strouhal numbers of . Cyclic formation and convection of these structures along the chord of the airfoil and entrainment of high-momentum freestream fluid into the separated zone resulted in periodic flow separation and reattachment and a nearly time-averaged chordwise spatially uniform increase in suction. In contrast, excitation at higher Strouhal numbers resulted in smaller, less-coherent structures in the shear layer that quickly developed over the airfoil and disintegrated. These small-scale structures with high passage frequency are effective at entraining freestream air into the separated region, generating a significant suction peak near the leading edge, and reattaching the flow over nearly of the chord. In this case, the significant separation-line unsteadiness was absent, and the resultant unsteady loading is expected to be much smaller than that of the low-Strouhal-number excitation cases.",57,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057804,"A tremendous number of gust-load cases need to be computed during the aircraft design and certification process. From an aerodynamic point of view, gust-load predictions in industry rely on linear potential flow methods, which are inappropriate at transonic flight conditions. Prediction accuracy can be enhanced by accounting for aerodynamic loads computed with computational fluid dynamics, eventually resulting in lighter, more efficient designs. However, full-order, unsteady time-marching simulations are still prohibitively expensive in an industrial environment. Therefore, different reduced-order modeling techniques have been proposed to decrease the computational cost. This paper focuses on an unsteady nonlinear reduced-order model based on least-squares residual minimization and a comparison to the linearized frequency-domain method. Although the latter is in line with current industrial practice of sampling aerodynamic forces in the frequency domain, it neglects dynamic nonlinearities, which are included in the former approach. Results are presented for an airfoil and the NASA Common Research Model at transonic flow conditions exhibiting shock-induced separation during the airframe–gust interaction. Essential quantities for the gust-load analysis, such as global coefficients, sectional forces, and distributed quantities, are evaluated and compared to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of both model reduction techniques.",57,5

These consist of two shock structures: one originating from the nozzle throat, and another from its exit. Analyzing the shock pattern developing for different fluidic injection operating conditions, it is shown that fluidic injection allows the rearrangement of the shock structures relative to each other. Overlapping the two structures causes large pressure oscillations in the exhaust and high amplitudes of shock associated noise, whereas staggering the shock structures mitigates these effects. The screech tone frequency does not change for all injection operating configurations, although the shock diamonds are shifted drastically with respect to each other. Hence, the screech phenomenon is dominated by the primary shock spacing originating from the nozzle throat.",57,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057982,"The influence of temporal square-wave excitation on structural and mixing characteristics of an equidensity, gaseous jet in crossflow (JICF) was explored in the present study. As in separate unforced and sinusoidally excited JICF experiments, acetone planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging enabled this detailed quantification for the JICF for mean jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratios ranging from (with a convective unstable upstream shear layer, or USL, in the absence of forcing) to (with a globally unstable USL). Such square-wave excitation of the jet fluid required adaptive feedforward control, not only to create more accurate temporal square waveforms but to enable more accurate comparison among alternative forcing conditions. Square-wave excitation of the JICF demonstrated a significant influence on the naturally globally unstable JICF, where specific nondimensional stroke ratios within -dependent ranges could produce deeply penetrating, periodic vortices with improved jet penetration and spread. Enhanced jet penetration did not always correlate with better molecular mixing, however; there was a stronger correlation of improved mixing at higher values with creation of a more symmetric jet cross section via square-wave excitation, especially one with a clear counter-rotating vortex pair structure.",57,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057612,"The evolution of the shear-layer flowfield of a round transient turbulent jet is analytically investigated within the near-field of the jet over which the velocity potential core decays. The model results are verified and expanded by performing a large-eddy simulation of the suddenly started jet. Unlike quasi-steady approaches, the present work aims at solving the momentum conservation while preserving the time-dependent term. The governing equation is integrated with a mixing-length model to account for the turbulent mixing in the shear layer. The solution is asymptotically applicable to the shear layer of the circular jet and excludes the head vortex mixing. A reasoned calibration of the model parameters for moderate Reynolds numbers results in acceptable agreement for the streamwise entrainment both with experimental data and with large-eddy simulations. The validity limit of the present model is examined by outlining the characteristic length of the velocity potential core as well as the restricting effects of the jet dynamics on the founding assumptions of the model. The study will be instrumental in developing a hot-jet ignition model in which the rate of mass entrainment into the jet influences the prediction of ignition based on the temperature and species distribution.",57,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057476,"An experimental study of the azimuthal modes of the sound field generated by a single-stream round jet installed near a flat plate is presented. The investigation is conducted at subsonic Mach numbers (up to 0.82) for the configuration in which the plate trailing edge is located in the linear hydrodynamic jet near field. It is shown that the azimuthal modes of the acoustic field contain additional information compared to the total signals and allow more precise characterization of the installation effect in the low-frequency domain where it is most pronounced. The factors influencing the accuracy of the azimuthal decomposition are considered. It is demonstrated that jet noise remains practically unaffected by the plate and that installation noise is localized in the azimuthal modes antisymmetric with respect to the plate. A novel procedure of splitting total noise into jet noise and installation noise components is proposed. It is shown that this procedure allows more precise determination of the installation noise parameters, which are shown to correspond to the analytical model based on the scattering of the jet near-field pulsations by a half-plane. Correlation properties of the azimuthal modes in the installed and uninstalled configurations are also investigated and analyzed.",57,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057086,"Measurements and predictions of far-field sound radiated by rounded forward-facing steps immersed in an incompressible turbulent boundary were performed. Four different corner rounding radii equal to 0%, 6.25%, 12.5%, and 25% of the step height were considered. The step height was 26.2% of the incoming boundary-layer thickness and the Reynolds number based on step height ranged between 35,000 and 104,000. Measurements of the spanwise averaged unsteady pressure show that the pressure on the downstream surface is a function of rounding due to change in the size and strength of the separation bubble, whereas on vertical face it remains independent of corner rounding. The pressure on either surface scales on the step height and free-stream velocity. Rounding the step corner leads to a consistent reduction in noise without changing the overall shape of the sound spectrum significantly. The sound from each rounded step exhibits the effects of step noncompactness, which prevents spectral scaling. The predictions of sound from an unrounded forward-facing step were made by combining a theoretical formulation with surface pressure measurements. The predictions describe the overall shape of the sound spectrum including the effects of step noncompactness accurately.",57,5

The wave equation of interest is the compressible Rayleigh equation. Two forms of the equation are considered, and the Green’s function solutions, subject to appropriate surface conditions on the centerbody and flight condition in the ambient, are presented. Directivity studies in a heated exhaust at temperature ratio of 2.0 and Mach number 0.90 indicate that a rigid centerbody tends to increase the sound propagation at forward angles relative to an exhaust without a centerbody, whereas application of suitable surface liner may significantly reduce this enhancement.",57,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057531,"In this work, scattering and shielding of the tonal noise from contrarotating open rotors by surrounding parts are investigated. The computational tool chain is based on unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations providing permeable integration surface data for a Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings-type evaluation (“Sound Generated by Turbulence and Surfaces in Arbitrary Motion,” Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series A: Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol. 264, No. 1151, 1969, pp. 321–342), which is coupled with a fast multipole boundary-element method to account for shielding by the airframe. The effect of a background mean flow is taken into account by applying a Lorentz transform to the boundary-element problem and using the Möhring analogy instead of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings formulation to obtain the incident acoustic field. Validation of the Möhring/boundary-element coupling method is shown on the basis of a model contrarotating open rotor with shielding geometries and a mounting pylon. The tool chain is then applied to a full-scale open-rotor engine installed in different aircraft tail configurations (T tail, L tail, and U tail) to assess their influence on flyover and lateral noise in takeoff conditions.",57,5

The cavities have a length-to-depth ratio , and a width-to-length ratio . Three complex cavity geometries are used to model features representative of real aircraft bays and compare them to a simple rectangular cavity. The rectangular configuration exhibits signs of a transitional cavity regime, with resonant tones that compare well with predicted Rossiter values. The addition of a leading-edge ramp lofts the cavity mixing layer and accelerates the cavity freestream, resulting in reduced Rossiter amplitudes and increased frequencies. Side-wall spillage vortices are present in the rectangular cavity but are not found after the addition of side ramps that lessen the pressure gradient forming them. A center scoop causes a spanwise variation of velocity characteristics within the flowfield. Finally, a jagged leading edge attached to the scooped case results in reduced velocity fluctuations with an increased Rossiter mode-2 amplitude.",57,5

The incoming boundary layer has a momentum thickness Reynolds number of 6600 at 1.5 chords upstream of the bump. The calculations, which employ up to 24 billion grid points, simulate the experimental model of Bachalo and Johnson (“Transonic, Turbulent Boundary-Layer Separation Generated on an Axisymmetric Flow Model,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 24, No. 3, 1986, pp. 437–443), except that the tunnel walls are ignored and free air is assumed. The effects of domain span and grid resolution are examined along with main flowfield features. The predicted shock position as well as separation and reattachment locations agree well with experiment. Grid convergence is observed in the attached region well upstream of separation. Two-point azimuthal correlations suggest that a span of at least 20 deg is needed in the attached region, whereas a 120 deg span appears insufficient for correlations to completely decay to zero by midspan in the separation/reattachment region. Computed rms surface pressure fluctuations display a sharp primary peak at the shock foot and a broader secondary peak near the reattachment location. Simulations reveal evidence of low-frequency shock unsteadiness; however, a longer statistical sample is needed to investigate this phenomenon.",57,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057302,Transonic aeroelasticity is an important consideration in the conceptual design of next-generation aircraft configurations. This paper develops a low-order physics-based flutter model for swept high-aspect-ratio wings. The approach builds upon a previously developed flutter model that uses the flowfield’s lowest moments of vorticity and volume-source density perturbations as its states. The contribution of this paper is a new formulation of the model for swept high-aspect-ratio wings. The aerodynamic model is calibrated using offline two-dimensional unsteady transonic computational-fluid-dynamics simulations. Combining that aerodynamic model with a beam model results in a low-dimensional overall aeroelastic system. The low computational cost of the model permits its incorporation in a conceptual design tool for next-generation transport aircraft. The model’s capabilities are demonstrated by finding transonic flutter boundaries for different clamped-wing configurations and investigating the influence of transonic flutter on the planform design of next-generation transport aircraft.,57,5

Here in this paper, the more practical case of starting flow is considered where the high angle of attack is achieved through an accelerated sinking movement over a finite time interval. The problem is classified into fast sinking motion, middle-speed sinking motion, and slow sinking motion, for which the flow and force evolution exhibit different behaviors. The acceleration is shown to generate unsteady pressure waves that feed the major shock wave and expansions wave. A nonlinear indicial approach based on application of weighted Duhamel superposition principle to nonlinear starting flow model is built. This nonlinear model is shown to compare well with computational fluid dynamics simulation. The physics related to various stages of force evolution is discussed.",57,5

This paper presents measurements of heat flux and boundary-layer transition in the Boeing/U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research Mach-6 Quiet Tunnel. This facility has been developed to provide quiet flow at high Reynolds number, with low noise levels comparable to flight. Previously, the global heat flux and location of the transition front were measured with temperature-sensitive paint (TSP). A new HIFiRE-5 model was built with a polyether ether ketone shell, which is suitable for infrared–thermographic heat-flux measurements. Quiet-flow tests at Reynolds numbers of and zero angle of attack indicate a centerline transition location within 4% of the earlier TSP results, on the order of the uncertainty of the two techniques. This good agreement reinforces confidence in the earlier measurements and the new infrared-based technique. Examination of the off-centerline transition front indicates that the wavelength of stationary crossflow vortices is the same for both models and instrumentation techniques, although the streaks do not coincide precisely.",57,5

Experimental investigations from the literature are reviewed and put into the perspective of the Kantrowitz theory. First, an empirical relation is developed that is valid for a wide Mach number range, and that can be calibrated to certain classes of intakes by the user.

Even though numerical simulation has become an irreplaceable technique in this field, few attempts focusing on method validation are reported, despite the widely existing simulative studies. Because of the urgent demand of such a validation task, the authors conduct a rigorous discussion on the effectiveness of a combinational WCNS-E-5 and ray-tracing method in aero-optical simulation. In section order, oblique shock wave, three-dimensional supersonic mixing layer, and subsonic commingled flow are employed for comparison with theoretical results, grid sensitivity analysis, and experimental data validation, respectively.

The primary purpose of partial-pressure fields is to provide a means of dissecting local drag contributors over a lifting body. The analysis shows that the integral of the Euler pressure over the surface of a lifting body of thickness recovers the Kutta–Joukowski theorem for lift, and results in Maskell’s formula for the vortex-induced drag in the limit of high Reynolds number; the combined integral of the dissipative pressure and wall shear stress results in a generalized form of Oswatitsch’s formula for entropy-flux drag.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057750,"Multifidelity surrogates are essential in cases where it is not affordable to have more than a few high-fidelity samples, but it is affordable to have as many low-fidelity samples as needed. In these cases, given a good correlation between the models, the performance of multifidelity models can be outstanding. The first objective of this paper is to discuss progress in creating accurate multifidelity surrogates when they are essential. A more ambiguous situation exists when it may be possible to afford enough high-fidelity samples to construct an accurate surrogate model. In that case, the question is whether a multifidelity surrogate will afford a substantial cost reduction for comparable accuracy. Our the second objective is to see if there are any indications under what circumstances this substantial cost reduction is realized. From the literature, it appears that it is hard to get an idea, in terms of cost savings, of when it is useful to invest the additional effort of creating and using multifidelity surrogates. It is observed that in some cases the inclusion of low-fidelity samples along with the high-fidelity samples in building multifidelity surrogates led to less accurate surrogates than just using the available high-fidelity samples.",57,5
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057061,A multifidelity framework oriented toward efficient modeling of combustion dynamics that integrates a reduced-order model (ROM) for the combustion response into the Euler equations is proposed. The ROM is developed from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a combusting flow that is periodically forced at the boundaries of a reduced domain. Galerkin’s method is used to reduce the high-order partial differential equations to a low-order ordinary differential equation system via proper orthogonal decomposition eigenbases generated from a reduced-domain dataset. Evaluations of the framework are performed based on parametric studies of a simplified test problem for a model combustor showing distinguishable combustion instability behavior. Two-way information transfer between the ROM and Euler solutions is accomplished by interface matching at the boundaries of the reduced domain. It is shown that accurate predictions require the use of multiple ROMs to account for both upstream- and downstream-traveling perturbations. Characteristic boundary conditions are required at both reduced-domain boundaries to minimize wave reflections and preclude generic unstable responses in the multifidelity model predictions. Comparisons with CFD solutions show the multifidelity model is capable of capturing overall instability trends.,57,5

Therefore, their influence on the burst velocity of rotors is worthy of investigation. The present paper addresses the analysis of rotational elastic instability in heterogeneous disks having variable thickness under magnetic field and thermal loading. Inclusion of the radial displacement in the centrifugal force indicates rotational instability at certain angular velocities. Closed-form expressions for the displacement and stresses are not possible due to variable material properties, thickness profile, thermal expansion, and conduction coefficients of the disk. The Complementary Functions Method is adopted as a numerical solution scheme. The results are obtained in terms of nondimensional parameters to achieve high accuracy with few collocation points. The burst velocities under influences of magnetic field and thermal loads are calculated. Redistributed hoop stresses are also plotted against angular velocity for different magnetic intensity and temperature changes. It is concluded that magnetic field has a stabilizing effect on the rotating heterogeneous disk and the influence of thermal load is negligible in the rotational stability analysis.",57,5

In this Paper, an improved multidisciplinary design optimization method based on parameterized free-form mesh deformation is proposed. Using this method, the analysis grid can be directly updated with high quality instead of regenerating the geometry model when design variables change during optimization. To achieve the mesh deformation of a blade in a single turbine stage, three-dimensional control volume needs to be constructed using two-dimensional control planes at different blade heights, where the control points in the two-dimensional control plane are arranged and parameterized according to the definition of profile design variables. The grids for both computational fluid dynamics and structural analysis are controlled by the same control volume to ensure grid consistency on the fluid–structure interface. Results for an example single turbine stage show that the proposed method can guarantee good controllability and high grid quality when updating design variables in optimization loop. Multidisciplinary design optimization for the single turbine stage is performed, and the optimization results indicate a significant improvement of isentropic efficiency and turbine blade fatigue life.

This includes the development of a stabilized time integrator with adaptive time-step control to maintain stability of the sensitivity calculations. Therefore, the approach maintains the initial-value formulation of the problem and avoids costly boundary-value space-time formulation in the least-square shadowing approaches. Both direct- and adjoint-sensitivity analyses approaches are discussed.

The issues currently experienced during large satellites’ vibration testing are discussed, examining practical examples that highlight the coupling existing between the item under test and facility and are the basis for the motivation behind the new methodology (i.e., VST). VST is proposed as a way to bypass some of these issues, and here its use as a pre- and postshaker test tool is discussed. In the paper, VST is applied to real test cases (Airbus’s large spacecraft BepiColombo, built for the European Space Agency’s first mission to Mercury), showing computations and real physical test data to illustrate the advantages of the methodology. These are mostly in terms of derisking of the physical test campaigns (due to the capability to simulate realistically the future physical test, thus reducing the probability of aborts and stops during the runs) and an improvement of the quality of the correlation process and related finite element model update (resulting from the capability to separate the dynamics of the satellite from the effects of the test equipment), ultimately providing a tool to address questions arising from test response observations, which are many. This tool also offers the possibility to improve vibration testing using six-degree-of-freedom facilities.

Since then, it has been the backbone in modeling piezoelectric actuation and sensing. However, even after 30 years of its existence, the model remains to be extended to incorporate the inertia terms of the system, which is important for high-frequency applications, such as structural health monitoring. This work presents a consistent and generic extension of the 1-D shear-lag model for the dynamic stress transfer of a piezoelectric wafer transducer bonded to a thin isotropic plate, incorporating the inertia of the transducer, host plate, and the adhesive. The transducer and the plate were considered to be under plane strain condition. The plate was modeled using the classical Kirchhoff’s plate theory, whereas the wafer transducer was considered to undergo only extensional deformation. The model led to a simple closed-form solution for the shear stress induced at the transducer–plate interface under harmonic electric potential excitation. The results were compared with detailed two-dimensional finite element dynamic simulations. A detailed numerical study was conducted to illustrate the influence of various transducer, plate, and adhesive parameters, as well as the excitation frequency on the inertia effect on the interfacial shear stress.",57,5

The present algorithm consists of three steps: initial mode selection with a priori criterion, model reduction using the selected modes, and a posteriori error evaluation. The algorithm is based on the Craig–Bampton method, which is one of the most widely used techniques. Specifically, the present algorithm uses, in a judicious manner, both an a priori mode selection criterion employing the moment-matching strategy and an a posteriori error estimation technique in evaluating the relative eigenvalue errors. If desired, an optional step of boundary interface reduction offers an additional possibility of obtaining a more compact model. The proposed iterative algorithm is recommended to researchers as well as commercialized software users in developing linear reduced-order structural dynamics models. Numerical examples are presented for its practical usage and performance.",57,5
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057309,"The paper presents the derivation of a modal nonlinear structural model and its coupling with a nonlinear aerodynamic model for static aeroelastic analysis of highly deformable configurations. The structural analysis, intended for geometrically nonlinear structures, computes the deformations of a beamlike structure by dividing it into a few segments. Large deformations are treated as the sum of large, rigid-body displacements of the segment plus small, elastic deformation within the segment. The latter are computed using a modal approach, where the natural modes of each segment are calculated with augmented large fictitious masses to improve the coupling between segments. The use of a modal method in a large-deformation case introduces difficulties in the application of compatibility equations, which are explained and addressed in the paper. The nonlinear aerodynamic model is an equivalent strip theory, in which each section is assigned a database of aerodynamic coefficients. Both the aerodynamic and structural models are suitable for beam-like wing structures and are highly computationally efficient. The numerical examples include three loading cases that validate the implementation of the methodology and demonstrate its use for static aeroelastic applications.",57,5
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057412,"This paper presents a high-order layerwise theoretical framework for laminated composite beams based on a piecewise description of the transverse shear-stress field. Linear and quadratic variations in the transverse shear-stress field are assumed in each discrete layer, and compatibility conditions of the shear stress are a priori fulfilled through the introduction of shear-stress variables defined on the layer surfaces. Based on the stress–strain relations, the transverse shear strain is obtained, and the in-plane displacement is determined by integrating the transverse shear strain along the thickness direction. By imposing continuity conditions of the displacements, a displacement field expression that contains only displacement variables is formulated. Moreover, a two-node beam element associated with the present model is developed, where Hermite cubic interpolation functions are used for the transverse displacement variable, and linear interpolation functions are employed for the remaining displacement variables. Comparisons with the exact solution, various displacement-based theories, and high-fidelity finite element models demonstrate the high accuracy of the present model in predicting the stress and displacement distributions. In addition, the introduction of sublayers to improve the modeling accuracy and the influence of the stiffness ratio between layers on the effectiveness of the proposed model are addressed.",57,5
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057774,"In this paper, a method to obtain effective continuum beam stiffness properties of tensegrity towers with struts in each bay is developed. Long tensegrity towers for space applications can be modeled as beam-like structures, and axial, bending, shear, and torsional stiffness properties can be used to make comparisons between alternatives to determine the optimum design for a mission. Continuum beam models and effective stiffness properties of Class-2 tensegrity towers are obtained using a modified energy equivalency approach. Self-stress levels (i.e., cable tension and strut compression) are varied to observe their influence on the effective stiffness properties. Axial and torsional rigidities are found to be highly affected by the self-stress level, while bending and shear rigidities are not affected as much. The obtained effective stiffness properties are validated with nonlinear finite element analyses. With these properties, alternative tower designs for a specific application can be readily evaluated without the need for numerous computationally expensive structural analyses.",57,5
