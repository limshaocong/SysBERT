0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058983,"This paper presents a novel method for airfoil drag estimation at Reynolds numbers between and . The novel method is based on a systematic study of 40 airfoils applying over 600 numerical simulations and considering natural transition. The influence of the airfoil thickness-to-chord ratio, camber, and freestream Reynolds number on both friction and pressure drag is analyzed in detail. Natural transition significantly affects drag characteristics and leads to distinct drag minima for different Reynolds numbers and thickness-to-chord ratios. The results of the systematic study are used to develop empirical correlations that can accurately predict an airfoil drag at low-lift conditions. The new approach estimates a transition location based on airfoil thickness-to-chord ratio, camber, and Reynolds number. It uses the transition location in a mixed laminar–turbulent skin-friction calculation, and corrects the skin-friction coefficient for separation effects. Pressure drag is estimated separately based on correlations of thickness-to-chord ratio, camber, and Reynolds number. The novel method shows excellent accuracy when compared with wind-tunnel measurements of multiple airfoils. It is easily integrable into existing aircraft design environments and is highly beneficial in the conceptual design stage.",58,7

This is well known for slender delta wings, for which various analytical models were developed and show accurate predictions of the lift enhancement. This paper shows that, when suitably designing the wing planform, LEVs can also exist on high-aspect-ratio (high-AR) wings. In this study, a quasi-three-dimensional flow model is presented for solving the stationary LEV phenomenon over a high-AR swept back wing, with sweep increasing toward the wingtip. Our model captures the three-dimensional phenomenon by satisfying conservation of mass and vorticity within the LEV, and using a combination of strip theory and the lifting-line theory. Our model predictions are compared with flow visualization data on a parabolic swept back wing. Results confirm that suitable sweep wing geometry can fix an LEV steadily over the upper wing surface, resulting in significant lift enhancement of up to 70%.",58,7

A single microsecond pulse with a rising time of and a decaying time of is employed. It is the first time that a series of planar-type pressure waves which is induced by the microsecond-pulsed dialectic barrier discharge plasma actuator and propagates outward in the rising period is observed. It is likely that the streamer discharge which occurs in the rising stage and conduces to numerous current pulses with energy release could play an important role in generating these pressure waves. During the plateau of the constant voltage of 10 kV, a wall jet that has a deflection angle of 60 deg is formed, and the maximum velocity is approximately , while a new type of arched jet is observed during the plateau of the constant voltage of 0 kV. These wall jets provide favorable conditions for creating some perturbations and promoting mixing between the mainstream flow and the boundary flow.",58,7

All experiments are performed on a NACA 0018 airfoil at chord-based Reynolds numbers of 80,000 and 120,000 and a range of angles of attack. A comparative analysis of near-wall flow development captured with planar, two-component PIV and surface temperature characteristics is used to establish a methodology for surface temperature-based diagnostics of laminar separation bubbles. For convection-dominated surface cooling, streamwise gradients of surface temperature are shown to mark mean separation and transition, occurring at the maximum and minimum values, respectively. The location of mean reattachment aligns with the location of minimum surface temperature. The obtained estimates are shown to agree well with those from PIV measurements. Transient surface cooling is also considered to estimate the local convective heat transfer coefficient, supporting the results obtained based on quasi-steady temperature measurements.",58,7
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059115,"Dynamic stall on wind turbine blades often leads to severe fatigue that tends to decrease the lifespan of the blades. To mitigate cyclic loading on the blades, trailing edge flaps (TEFs) may be used to control the energy captured by the blades. In this study the influence of a TEF on a pitching S833 cambered airfoil is investigated at a Reynolds number of 170,000 and reduced frequencies of and 0.1. The lift and moment hysteresis cycles are presented for mean pitch angles of 0 and 10° to represent stall onset and deep stall. The flap, hinged at 0.8 chord, is pitching with different phase lags to study the influence of flap motion. Coefficient-of-pressure contour plots presented here clearly indicate the leading-edge vortex (LEV) formation and convection. It is concluded that even though the TEF was not capable of controlling the formation of the LEV, it was, however, capable of reducing the LEV magnitude and, more important, a reduction in cyclic loading. It is recommended to dynamically pitch the flap out of phase with the airfoil motion to reduce the min/max of the lift and moment cycles and reduce negative damping that can lead to stall flutter.",58,7
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058650,"The present paper analyzes the vortical flow downstream of a delta wing. The delta wing is designed to generate a vortex that resembles the vortex of a nacelle strake. The experimental results of stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements performed at different positions downstream of the delta wing display the streamwise development of the vortex. Details of the postprocessing of the measurement data and a quantification of the uncertainties are presented. The evaluation of the mean axial and tangential velocity components and Reynolds stresses provides insights to the vortex characteristics and their development in the streamwise direction. In addition, results of numerical simulations with the DLR TAU-code applying the Menter-Shear Stress Transport (SST) eddy viscosity model and the Speziale-Sarkar-Gatski/Launder-Reece-Rodi (SSG/LRR)- Reynolds stress model show the ability of the turbulence models to capture the vortex development. The experimental results indicate a preservation of the vortex strength and structure downstream of the delta wing. The Menter-SST model does not predict this preservation; rather it computes a rapid decay of vortex strength and an increase in vortex size. In contrast, the results of the SSG/LRR- model are in good agreement with the experiments concerning the mean flow development. However, both turbulence models underpredict the turbulence in the vortex core.",58,7

A test case with attached flow conditions is chosen to study the blade tip vortex aerodynamics on a four-bladed rotor. The resulting azimuth-dependent vortex system of the rotor is analyzed. In addition to velocity fields acquired by a particle image velocimetry system, the current investigation also uses a background-oriented schlieren setup to capture the density gradients caused by the blade tip vortices. These optical measurement techniques enable the reconstruction of the azimuth-dependent vortex system for vortex ages up to 70 deg. The pitch variation, and thus the change in lift, is found to be the main influence on the characteristics of the tip vortex system. The topology of the vortex, the interconnected shear layer, and the position of the vortex with respect to the blade tip appear to be highly pitch dependent. An analysis of the blade tip vortices is carried out, focusing on the swirl velocity, core radius, and circulation distribution. The results are compared to previous investigations at the same test facility and a numerical simulation.",58,7

Both the angle of attack (, 8, and 12 deg) and gust core size (, 0.25, and 0.50) are varied. In all cases, flow disruptions induced by the various gust encounters are analyzed alongside the corresponding aerodynamic load perturbations. Equivalent inviscid simulations supplement the present flow analyses. Boundary-layer disruption exhibits increased complexity at higher angles of attack characterized by a more coherent leading edge vortex (LEV) and a secondary boundary-layer disruption further downstream. By these features begin to resemble dynamic stall. Both flow laminarization upstream of the induced LEV and lower boundary-layer breakup are less pronounced as angle of attack increases. Interaction with a large gust, , at the lowest angle of attack, , produced a response similar to that observed in the higher encounters, that is, more coherent LEV and secondary boundary-layer disruptions downstream.",58,7
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059218,"An analytical and computational investigation of the effect of control surface freeplay on aeroelastic behavior, including random gust response and limit cycle oscillations (LCO), is presented. An efficient method to compute the total gust+LCO response is developed using random input describing functions (RIDF), in a manner analogous to harmonic input describing functions for LCO calculation. Results are obtained for an airfoil with trailing edge flap freeplay and linear potential flow aerodynamics at various gust strengths, freeplay sizes, and flow velocities. Both stable and unstable responses are detected. It is found that LCO coexists with gust response for weak gust/large freeplay combinations, and it is quenched for sufficiently strong gust/small freeplay. Time marching results are provided to validate the RIDF method and confirm the findings. The present work appears to be the first use of RIDF in aeroelasticity although it is well known to nonlinear control systems analysts. Notably the RIDF method in its present form is also applicable when steady flow aerodynamic nonlinearities are included.",58,7
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059038,"Lifting-line theory has formed the basis of wing-design understanding for nearly a century. This theory has previously been used to develop a class of optimal lift distributions that minimize induced drag for finite wings under specific structural and aerodynamic constraints. This class of lift distributions was first introduced by Prandtl in 1933 and includes the elliptic lift distribution and the bell-shaped lift distribution, among others, as special cases. Here, it is shown that, for all lift distributions in this class except the elliptic lift distribution, an antisymmetric twist distribution can be added to the wing to control the adverse yawing moment during roll. The requisite amount of this additional twist distribution depends on the prescribed yawing-moment sign and magnitude, and it can be used to produce zero adverse yaw or even proverse yaw during roll. Of course, employing this methodology to control the roll–yaw coupling produces additional induced drag relative to the case without roll–yaw coupling control. This induced-drag penalty is studied in detail and shows that a symmetric lift distribution within this class can be selected to minimize induced drag for a desired roll–yaw coupling. Roll initiation and steady rolling rate are both considered. Results can be applied to the design of morphing aircraft to minimize the use of a vertical control surface for yaw control.",58,7

Flow solutions were generated using Helios, with a delayed detached eddy simulation model. The configuration is based on one set of rotors/wing of a quadrotor biplane tail-sitter aircraft. Simulations were conducted to assess the effect of varying angle of attack, rotor revolutions per minute with rotor speed, and rotor diameter. Two configurations were examined, the rotor-blown-wing baseline with two 60.96 cm diameter rotors and the configuration with four 30.48 cm diameter rotors. The smaller rotors were analyzed at the revolutions per minute corresponding to producing half the thrust of the rotor-blown-wing baseline rotor. The presence of the wing in hover resulted in the rotor-blown-wing baseline rotor operating at 1.9% lower power loading than the same rotor in isolation. In comparison, the configuration reduced power loading by 13.6% compared to the isolated rotor. In forward flight (airplane mode), an increasing angle of attack was shown to increase thrust produced on the downstroke side of the rotor. Furthermore, the presence of the wing increases the thrust produced on the bottom half of the disk. Both the blown wings increase the ratio from 3.2 for the isolated wing to 3.6 and 4.3 for the rotor-blown-wing baseline and configurations, respectively.",58,7
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058906,"A laminar–turbulent transition model is presented. The model accounts for longitudinal transition mechanisms (i.e., Tollmien–Schlichting-induced transition) and was calibrated using stability computations on similar boundary-layer profiles at Mach number ranging from zero to four on both adiabatic and isothermal walls. The model embeds the so-called C1 criterion for transverse transition mechanisms (i.e., crossflow-wave-induced transition). Finally, the model accounts for separation-induced transition by means of the Gleyzes criterion. The transition model is written under a transport equation formalism. Validations are performed on three-dimensional configurations, and comparisons against results from a transition database method for natural transition, exact linear stability computations, and experimental data are shown.",58,7
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058518,"Surface step effects on boundary-layer transition are modeled using a variable -factor method for transition dominated by Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities. Experimental correlations provide a bounding expression for the change in the critical -factor for transition onset, which provides a predictive means to account for surface steps. An investigation is conducted to assess the applicability of this approach for more general step arrangements. The approach is applied to capturing the superposition of a forward-facing and a backward-facing step in the form of a rectangular protrusion or a wide gap. Results show that a rectangular protrusion is well modeled by a linear combination of steps. However, a wide gap is best represented by a backward-facing step, without regard for the following forward-facing step. The sensitivity to streamwise step position is also investigated. Results show that the method is effective at capturing step effects for step positions in the neighborhood of the instability neutral point, and extending downstream close to the smooth-surface transition location. The effects of steps placed well upstream of the instability neutral point are overpredicted by the step model, likely the result of nonparallel effects on the upstream decay or as a result of the underlying receptivity occurring in the neighborhood of the neutral point.",58,7
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058950,"The roughness-shielding concept involves reducing the receptivity of large-amplitude discrete roughness elements (DREs) by surrounding them with subcritical distributed roughness. The present work studies the effects of distributed roughness present upstream or downstream of DREs using direct numerical simulations (DNS) and wind tunnel experiments using suitable abstractions. The roughness elements, whose shapes are chosen to enable simple, matched studies, are incorporated in the DNS using an immersed boundary method. The detailed evolution of the different components of the vorticity field is examined. The DNS is supported by naphthalene shear-stress visualization of matched experiments at the Klebanoff–Saric Wind Tunnel at Texas A&M University. Both DNS and experimental results show that placing a model-distributed roughness strip or an equivalent flat strip either only upstream or only downstream of the DRE can suppress transition. Detailed mechanisms responsible for transition control by upstream and downstream distributed roughness patches are investigated and explained from a vorticity dynamics point of view. A generalized shielding strategy using a streamwise array of spanwise strips is suggested.",58,7
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057808,"An experimental study of wall pressure fluctuations beneath a turbulent boundary layer was carried out on a plate model with a streamwise varying pressure gradient along the plate length. The wall pressure fluctuations were measured with flush-mounted Kulite sensors, and mean velocity measurements across the boundary layer were performed by using a single-wire hot-wire anemometer. A variety of streamwise pressure distributions were imposed by changing the position and the angle of attack of a NACA 0012 airfoil installed above the plate. The effect of the upstream flow history on the wall pressure spectra in the presence of the streamwise varying pressure gradient was studied. Spectral attenuation due to the spatial averaging associated with a finite sensor size was corrected via the Corcos correction. The results show that the Corcos correction to the measured Kulite spectra leads to an overprediction of the spectral intensity at medium frequencies and an underprediction at high frequencies. Hence, a new correction is proposed based on the measured spectral attenuation. Finally, the measurements also indicate that even slight imperfections in sensor mounting and relatively weak upstream flow disturbances can have a significant influence on the measured spectra of the wall pressure fluctuations.",58,7

The snapshot application of the POD resulted in modes consistent with previous studies on cavity flows under similar conditions. The time-resolved nature of velocity datasets also allowed for the application of the classical POD in both space and time which, for a stationary flow, is solved in the frequency domain. Eigenvalue spectra and convergence plots revealed that these POD modes are organized by capturing the maximum energy associated with dominant frequencies. The extracted eigenvectors revealed a strong dependency on frequency, with the most dominant modes corresponding to frequencies associated with Rossiter modes known to dominate open cavities. Mach number comparisons from the classical POD application reveal that their modes efficiently capture energy of dominant frequencies associated with the flow dynamics, regardless of the freestream conditions. Using a similarity parameter between spatial unitary basis functions, it was shown that the modes at different Mach numbers were quantitatively similar at the same Strouhal and POD mode numbers.",58,7

A numerical solution, based on a Galerkin projection and an efficient method for the resulting nonlinear eigenvalue problem, is compared with analytical approximations for low and high frequencies. A collection of results is presented and discussed. Modal wave numbers are traced in the complex plane for varying impedance, showing the usual regular modes and surface waves. A study of a vanishing boundary layer (the Ingard limit) showed that, in contrast to the smoothly converging acoustic modes and downstream running acoustic surface wave, the convergence of the other surface waves is numerically more difficult. Effects of (transverse) turning points and exponential decay are discussed. Especially the occurrence of modes insensitive to the wall impedance is pointed out.

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058934,"Counter-rotating open rotors (CRORs) are known to have advantageous propulsive efficiency properties but, at the same time, many noise emission issues related to this technology still need to be investigated. The noise they generate consists of tonal and broadband components, of which the tonal components often appear in narrow frequency bands with large amplitudes. During beamforming investigations, this often makes sorting them out from among other noise sources in the same frequency bin rather straightforward. On the other hand, the broadband noise sources can be characterized as having small amplitudes: in general, they are not the dominant noise sources in many frequency bins; but, overall, a significant noise component that needs to be investigated. The literature has provided a single microphone signal preprocessing method for removing the tonal components, hence isolating the broadband noise of a CROR: the signal of which has been shown to be appropriate for the investigation of broadband spectra. In this paper, this preprocessing method is further developed into a beamforming method that can be used in order to localize the broadband noise sources of CRORs. The resulting beamforming maps have been compared to the results of earlier broadband noise CROR studies, showing the validity of the new method and the advantages of using it as compared to methods used in other investigations.",58,7

The purpose of the present work is to evaluate whether part of the observed differences could stem from a biased wavenumber definition made during the impedance eduction process. Comparisons are made between the results of impedance eductions with uniform flow and the Ingard–Myers boundary condition, with the one-dimensional (1D) linearized Euler equations and with the two-dimensional (2D) linearized Euler equations, that is, in the cross section. Both numerical synthetic data and experimental data are used for the eduction of two sample liners, with bulk Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 0.3, and at frequencies ranging from 400 to 3000 Hz.

In addition, the influence of the mesh growth ratio in the wall-normal direction and the mesh resolutions in the wall-parallel directions are investigated, as well as the size of the first element in the wall-normal direction. In the present wall model, the wall shear stress is computed according to the wall tangential velocity at the interface between the first and second cells from the wall. The stress is then used to update the solution unknowns. Various strategies are evaluated using a turbulent channel flow at a high Reynolds number. A comparison between a wall-modeled LES and implicit LES (ILES) without a wall model on a coarse mesh shows that the wall-modeled approach produces better results than the ILES.

The flow is assessed using an array of fast-response pressure transducers in conjunction with a high-repetition rate particle image velocimetry system. Development of the mean flow structures early in each interaction is observed to be consistent with the free interaction concept. Unsteady wall-pressure energy content at frequencies above those associated with the characteristic low-frequency shock motion also shows significant similarities in the vicinity of the shock foot. Results confirm that this low-frequency peak is not associated with a narrow-band forcing mechanism from either upstream or downstream, but rather a characteristic frequency that varies with interaction strength, which describes the flow’s dynamic response.

Direct numerical simulation (DNS) data and linear interaction analysis (LIA) are used to develop a predictive model for the thermodynamic field. Specifically, transport-equation-based models are proposed for the variances in temperature, pressure, density, and entropy. The jump in the thermodynamic variances is modeled in terms of the mean compression at the shock, and the closure coefficients are obtained via Kovásznay mode decomposition. By comparison, the downstream decay is modeled in a phenomenological way in terms of acoustic transient near the shock and a far-field decay due to viscous dissipation.

With this approach, the effects of radial modal coupling caused by the impedance jump across the connection interface between the rigid wall and perforated liner in the combustor are studied. The eigenfrequencies of the first longitudinal mode, the second longitudinal mode, and the first azimuthal mode are examined. The results show that the radial modal coupling is crucial to the prediction of the stability. It is also found that the absorption of the perforated liners is directly determined by the integrated effect of the local fluctuating pressure differences across the perforated plates. The integrated effect is influenced by both the position and length of the perforated liners. Effective control is achieved when the liners are placed at the pressure antinode of the combustion chamber, whereas ineffective control is achieved when they are placed at the pressure node of the combustion chamber. Also compared is the effectiveness of the outer and inner liners, and it is found that it is essential to consider the coupled system of the two liners when checking the overall control effects.",58,7

Notably, most current studies are limited to monodisperse suspensions with only one particle size. In this study, the rich aluminum particle–air detonation with two particle size distributions (namely, the monodisperse and the polydisperse with log-normal particle size distribution) is numerically studied by using the Eulerian–Lagrangian method along with a new hybrid aluminum combustion model. Significant discrepancies of the one-dimensional detonation front structures are observed between the monodisperse detonation and the polydisperse counterpart. And, the physical mechanisms of these discrepancies have been revealed by decoupling the gas–particles interactions with the one-dimensional flow theory. It is mainly caused by the different timings of the particle phase transition processes and the consequently different heat transfer characteristics, which are the effects of multiple timescales and length scales in the polydisperse detonation. Furthermore, owing to the wider reaction zones of polydisperse detonations than that of the monodisperse counterpart, discrepancies of two-dimensional detonation cell sizes are observed as well. This study reveals the great importance of considering particle size distribution in heterogeneous detonation simulations.",58,7

Two different problems, a Sandia challenge function and a constitutive model for C/SiC composites, are considered for method evaluations. Performances of different methods are evaluated regarding reliabilities and errors in the output quantity derived with the uncertainty propagation. A manufactured solution method is employed. Results show that the TI, KDE, and D-S methods converge to the true distribution with increasing samples, whereas the EV method tends to expand the uncertainties. Under small samples , the TI method exhibits the highest reliability, and the KDE method exhibits the smallest error. Under extremely small samples the D-S method offers a balance between reliability and error. The TI method can apply well in the constitutive model for the characterization of material uncertainties, where failure is of high consequence and conservatism is emphasized.

A rectangular multistable plate is designed with the optimal location of actuators, aiming at two-way snap-through without the loss of bistability. A multi-objective derivative-free optimization scheme is used to minimize the snap-through voltages and maximize the out-of-plane displacements. The designed multistable plates with actuators are embedded at a suitable location of the morphing trailing edge flap. As the multistable plates snap, the flap deflects to a new position. The mechanism of the new morphing concept is simulated and analyzed with finite element tools.",58,7
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058899,"This study presents the derivation and application of the modal rotations method (MRM), a novel framework for the computation of large deformations of complex wing-like structures using a modal approach. The method targets static analyses of slender structures, accounting for large-deformation nonlinearity. The input for the analysis is linear modal finite-element-based data. However, the MRM uses modal rotation data, rather than deformation modes. The modal rotations are used for the solution of the nonlinear kinematic problem along with an iterative load-correction procedure that accounts for the geometric stiffening. The method is suitable for cases where the generation of an equivalent beam model is impossible or requires considerable effort, such as structures of multiple different sections, structures having abrupt geometrical changes, and lattice structures. The MRM is verified with three test cases. The first is a simple geometry, a one-dimensional symmetric beam loaded in one plane. The second and third test cases are three-dimensional built-up structures aimed to challenge the method with abrupt geometric changes, orthotropic material coupling, and nontrivial geometries. All test cases yield accurate results compared with nonlinear finite element analyses. Parametric studies present the dependency of the results on different computational parameters and the load magnitude.",58,7
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058775,"On the basis of advanced functional structures such as aeronautics and astronautics, it is common to arrange strain measurements at finite points on the structure and then reconstruct the displacement field of the structure to predict the health situation of the structure. Unlike the previous methods of predicting one- and two-dimensional structures displacements using simplified conditions, this paper presents a set of technical schemes and operational procedures for measuring strains in any direction on complex three-dimensional structure to reconstruct three-dimensional displacement field. First, a general strain–displacement transformation equation is derived and proposed for a complex three-dimensional structure in any direction. Second, an extended order method and a point selection strategy are proposed in order to make better use of measurement information and improve accuracy. We construct an optimization model and determine the optimal number of measurement points and modal order by using high-performance simulated annealing (HP-SA) algorithm. Next, we build an experimental system and select a specific complex three-dimensional structure to verify our work. Finally, we validate and discuss the theory proposed in this Paper with experimental data, and verify the reconstruction accuracy. After eliminating the factors of the system error, the relative error can be controlled in an ideal range of 2–5%.",58,7
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059055,"Motivated by evident absence of studies on doubly curved closed nanocomposite shells under complex thermomechanical loading conditions, this paper presents an analytical investigation on the buckling and postbuckling behavior of the carbon-nanotube-reinforced composite toroidal shell segment surrounded by an elastic foundation, exposed to preexisting thermal loadings and subjected to axial compression, external pressure, and combined mechanical loads. Carbon nanotubes are reinforced into the matrix phase through uniform or functionally graded distributions. The material properties of the constituents are assumed to be temperature dependent, and the effective properties of the nanocomposite are estimated by an extended rule of mixture. Two temperature conditions and various situations of mechanical loads are considered. Basic equations are established within the framework of the classical shell theory taking into account the geometrical nonlinearity and surrounding medium-shell interaction. Multiterm solutions of deflection and stress function are assumed to satisfy simply supported boundary conditions, and the Galerkin method is applied to obtain nonlinear load-deflection relations from which buckling loads and postbuckling paths are determined. Numerical examples are carried out, interesting discussions are given, and beneficial and deteriorative effects of various factors are analyzed.",58,7
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059102,"Because of their higher aerodynamic efficiency and lighter structural weight, thin composite wings with large aspect ratios are increasingly being used for civil transport aircraft wing design. However, the increased flexibility can induce several performance issues, such as high deflections, reduced control authority, coupled flight dynamics, and, possibly, a reduction in the flutter speed. Therefore, including control surface and control law design at the conceptual design stage is becoming increasingly important. This paper presents a novel approach for integrating a control objective into an aircraft design optimization at the conceptual design stage by proposing the use of the eigenvalues of the controllability Gramian to enhance the controllability of an aircraft. The individual eigenvalues of the controllability Gramian quantify the energy required to move along the corresponding eigenvector, which is observed to be dominated by one state-space variable. A higher eigenvalue implies lower energy requirements for controlling that eigenvector, thus the corresponding state-space variable. This approach does not rely on a control law design but on modifying the open-loop system such that it is easier to control. The approach is applied to conduct multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) of a composite flying-wing test aircraft. A previously developed MDAO framework is used to design the internal structural layout, using curvilinear spars and ribs (SpaRibs) and straight spars and ribs. It is found that the optimal control designs have up to 8% higher flutter speed with a 3.7% weight penalty. Moreover, the frequencies of the vibration mode shapes are higher for the optimal control designs. The active flutter suppression controllers are designed after the MDAO process, and it is found that the optimal control designs have significantly higher gain and phase margins. As a result, the optimal control designs yield higher robust closed-loop flutter speed as compared with the weight-minimized design.",58,7
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058778,"Spacecraft with large arrays sometimes have deployed sizes that are much larger than the launch volumes; in this case, deployable arrays are used. Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This work presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new array architecture that is self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) and is described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this work presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance considerations of deployment motion, deployment stiffness, and dynamics.",58,7
35,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058319,"To achieve high-precision shape control of antenna reflectors in the presence of model errors, an adaptive shape control method based on the feedback error learning algorithm is proposed. First, the finite element model of a planar hexagonal reflector with 30 piezoelectric actuators is established, by which the influence coefficient matrix is derived. Second, the feedback error learning method is developed, and it can iteratively modify the inverse model of the reflector system through online learning, thus avoiding the effect of model errors on shape control precision. An adaptive step size adjustment strategy for the method is proposed to improve the convergence precision and speed. Then, the effectiveness of the proposed method is intensively studied in comparison with the traditional influence coefficient matrix method by numerical simulations. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a fairly high precision for all kinds of model errors, whereas the model errors will greatly reduce the precision of the influence coefficient matrix method. The adaptive step size adjustment strategy can greatly improve the convergence precision and speed. Finally, experimental results further verified the above conclusions, which prove the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method for the high-precision shape control.",58,7
