In a previous study, the authors found that a rudimentary emulation of this feature (termed a self-adaptive flap) enhances the poststall lift characteristics of low-aspect-ratio flat-plate wings at . This enhancement, however, was found to vary with the different chordwise locations of the flap and across different planforms. In a continued effort to understand this further, two-dimensional particle image velocimetry investigation was carried out in the midspan plane of the low-aspect-ratio wings. For the varying-span elliptical wings, the results reveal that the flap/shear layer interaction promotes reattachment of the separated shear layer via increased entrainment. This reattachment location varies for the different chordwise location of the flap, resulting in a different extent of the separation bubble and bubble-induced camber, which in turn is responsible for different poststall lift enhancement. On the other hand, for the rectangular wing, the flap promotes large-scale vortex formation. The formation and shedding cycle of large-scale vortices has a significant impact on the mean-body forces because of which the time-averaged poststall lift is enhanced.",58,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058340,"This work deals with a highly resolved large-eddy simulation of a three-element high-lift airfoil with a deployed slat and flap. The aim of this simulation is twofold: the first objective is to perform a detailed flow analysis and identify the physical flow mechanisms responsible for noise generation; the second objective is to provide an important numerical database that may be used to assess more affordable numerical approaches based, for instance, on hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation (LES) methods. The assessment of the present LES relies on an extensive database, which was collected during a campaign performed in the ONERA F2 wind tunnel in the framework of LEISA2: a joint ONERA/DLR, German Aerospace Center project. The results of the present LES show an overall agreement with the measurements that is generally within the experimental uncertainty, especially in the slat and flap coves. Differences between the LES and the experiments are present on the flap suction side, where the flow is observed to be very sensitive to slight modifications of the numerical or experimental conditions. The simulation confirms that a large-scale coupled self-sustained oscillations mechanism is present between the slat and flap cavities. Some insight about the transition process on the main wing suction side is also discussed in the paper.",58,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058021,"The unsteady flow past a reverse delta wing is simulated numerically to characterize the structure of the vortical flow and associated unsteady phenomena, and quantify the impact of such structures on the aerodynamic performance. The most cost-effective grid-size/time-step combination is selected by performing a coupled sensitivity analysis. This numerical approach is successfully validated against well-established results for a delta wing. It is established that the flow past a reverse delta wing is always unsteady even at small angles of attack. The shear layer separating at the leading edge of the reverse delta wing rolls up into spanwise vortical structures that, as they are convected downstream, pair, realign, and reorganize, generating suction that contributes substantially to the lift produced by a reverse delta wing. The tip vortices confine the vortical structures to the leeward side and contribute to a less extent to lift. Power spectral density analysis shows that the unsteadiness of the lift coefficient is related to vortex shedding and reorganization of the vortical structures. Finally, it is confirmed that the lift-to-drag ratio of a delta wing and a reverse delta wing is, surprisingly, about the same.",58,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058323,"In the present paper, a surrogate-based methodology is developed and applied to the design of a control surface placed on an artillery projectile. An artificial neural network is used to estimate the aerodynamic contribution of the control device from numerical simulations. These estimations are coupled to a flight mechanics code to evaluate the trajectories of controlled projectiles. From these six-/seven-degree-of-freedom computations, the trajectories modifications are modeled using kriging. A correction device should minimize the distance to a ellipse (with as the projectile standard deviation of the projectile dispersion) around the mean impact point while ensuring problem-specific constraint fulfillment. The kriging databases are sequentially enriched with the impact point position of the projectile configurations maximizing the expected improvement criterion until a convergence state, assessed by leave-one-out cross validation, is reached. Computational-fluid-dynamics-based evaluations of the optimum configuration coefficients provide a refinement of the neural network databases in the relevant area of the design space. A course correction corresponding to a decrease of two standard deviations in the lateral direction and an increase of two standard deviations in range is achieved, respectively, by reducing the pitching moment of the projectile and increasing its lift-to-drag ratio.",58,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057870,"Dynamic mode decomposition has emerged as a leading technique to identify spatiotemporal coherent structures from high-dimensional data, benefiting from a strong connection to nonlinear dynamical systems via the Koopman operator. In this work, two recent innovations that extend dynamic mode decomposition to systems with actuation and systems with heavily subsampled measurements are integrated and unified. When combined, these methods yield a novel framework for compressive system identification. It is possible to identify a low-order model from limited input–output data and reconstruct the associated full-state dynamic modes with compressed sensing, adding interpretability to the state of the reduced-order model. Moreover, when full-state data are available, it is possible to dramatically accelerate downstream computations by first compressing the data. This unified framework is demonstrated on two model systems, investigating the effects of sensor noise, different types of measurements (e.g., point sensors, Gaussian random projections, etc.), compression ratios, and different choices of actuation (e.g., localized, broadband, etc.). In the first example, this architecture is explored on a test system with known low-rank dynamics and an artificially inflated state dimension. The second example consists of a real-world engineering application given by the fluid flow past a pitching airfoil at low Reynolds number. This example provides a challenging and realistic test case for the proposed method, and results demonstrate that the dominant coherent structures are well characterized despite actuation and heavily subsampled data.",58,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057889,"A methodology is presented that exploits both data-assimilation techniques and resolvent analysis for reconstructing turbulent flows, containing organized structures, with an efficient set of measurements. The mean (time-averaged) flow is obtained using variational data-assimilation that minimizes the discrepancy between a limited set of flow measurements, generally from an experiment, and a numerical simulation of the Navier–Stokes equations. The fluctuations are educed from resolvent analysis and time-resolved data at a single point in the flow. Resolvent analysis also guides where measurements of the mean and fluctuating quantities are needed for efficient reconstruction of a simple example case study: flow around a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of . For this flow, resolvent analysis reveals that the leading singular value, most amplified modes, and the mean profile for scale with the shedding frequency and length of the recirculation bubble. A relationship between these two parameters reinforces the notion that a wave maker, for which the length scales with the recirculation bubble, determines the frequency and region where an instability mechanism is active. The procedure offers a way to choose sensor locations that capture the main coherent structures of a flow and a method for computing mean pressure by using correctly weighted resolvent modes.",58,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058205,"This paper extends the resolvent formalism for wall turbulence to account for the effect of streamwise-constant riblets. Under the resolvent formulation, the Navier–Stokes equations are interpreted as a forcing-response system: the nonlinear convective term is interpreted as a feedback forcing on the remaining linear terms, which generates a velocity and pressure response. A gain-based decomposition of the linear forcing-response transfer function—the resolvent operator—yields highly amplified velocity and pressure modes, which can be considered key building blocks of the turbulent flow field. Previous work has shown that these high-gain modes provide substantial insight into turbulence statistics, structure, and control of smooth-walled flows. To introduce the effect of riblets within this framework, a linear spatially varying body force is added to the governing equations. In other words, volume penalization is used to approximate the surface features. Predictions for spanwise-periodic and streamwise-constant riblets show that specific high-gain modes identified from the modified governing equations reproduce observations made in prior direct numerical simulations with limited computation. The deterioration in performance with increasing riblet size is predicted well and so is the emergence of spanwise rollers resembling Kelvin–Helmholtz vortices. This new modeling framework is also used to pursue limited riblet shape optimization.",58,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057800,"The multiscale development of dynamic stall was studied using a scale-based modal analysis technique. Time-resolved velocity field data around an airfoil during dynamic stall were used for this analysis, with experimental conditions corresponding to and . Intrinsic mode functions were determined by a multivariate, multidimensional empirical mode decomposition method, which ensures mode alignment between velocity components and modal dependency on the full spatiotemporal flowfield. Individual intrinsic mode functions were linked to physically significant phenomena in the flowfield, including the formation of vortical structures due to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, interactions between shear-layer vortices leading to vortex pairing, and ultimately shear-layer roll-up and the formation of the dynamic stall vortex. In addition to qualitatively describing these flow structures and interactions, their characteristic length and time scales within the intrinsic mode functions were quantified. These quantitative measures were found to be consistent with time and length scales reported in the literature on experimental investigations of canonical fluid dynamic processes.",58,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057959,"A multifidelity framework is established and demonstrated for the prediction of combustion instabilities in rocket engines. The main idea is to adapt appropriate fidelity modeling approaches for different components in a rocket engine to ensure accurate and efficient predictions. Specifically, the proposed framework integrates projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) that are developed using bases generated on truncated domain simulations. The ROM training is performed on truncated domains, and thus does not require full-order model solutions on the full rocket geometry, thus demonstrating the potential to greatly reduce training costs. Geometry-specific training is replaced by the response generated by perturbing the characteristics at the boundary of the truncated domain. This training method is shown to enhance the predictive capabilities and robustness of the resulting ROMs, including at conditions outside the training range. Numerical tests are conducted on a quasi-one-dimensional model of a single-element rocket combustor, and the present framework is compared to traditional ROM development approaches.",58,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058499,"Reduced-order models of the airwake produced by the flow over a simple frigate ship are developed using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based methods. The focus is to understand the trade space between cost and accuracy, where different forms of the POD technique are concerned. Of particular importance is the upfront expense of employing “classical” or snapshot forms of the POD technique in both scalar and vector forms using either time-suppressed data (conventional POD) or kernels constructed from cross-spectral densities of the fluctuating velocity. The latter approach is referred to as harmonic POD so as not to exclude harmonic transforms in space. The flow over a simple frigate ship is an ideal testbed, given that it is unsteady, three-dimensional, and inhomogeneous in all spatial directions, as well as stationary in time. The spatial modes from all three techniques are shown to correspond to unique timescales, thereby demonstrating how the preservation of the temporal behavior associated with a particular spatial scale is not unique to the harmonic-POD approach.",58,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058638,"In many areas of data science, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown a remarkable ability to learn complex, nonlinear relationships between sets of variables. In this paper, this network architecture is applied to several different tasks relating to high-speed turbulent flows. In the first section, linear stochastic estimation (LSE) as proposed by Adrian (“On the Role of Conditional Averages in Turbulence Theory,” Symposium on Turbulence in Liquids, 1977; and “Conditional Eddies in Isotropic Turbulence,” Physics of Fluids, Vol. 22, No. 11, 1979, pp. 2065–2070) is reformulated as a machine learning problem, and the two methods are compared. Both a DNN and a LSE model are trained to estimate fluctuating pressure at a subset of locations in the near field of a Mach 0.6 jet, given the pressure measured at other locations. It is shown that DNNs exhibit a slight performance benefit over traditional LSE models on average. The second part of this paper focuses on the utilization of an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the directional overall sound pressure level (OASPL) in the far field of a supersonic multistream jet. A database was created, describing the near-field and far-field conditions of a complex nonaxisymmetric jet flow, with Mach numbers ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. The problem was posed as a form of multivariate nonlinear regression, and an ANN was used to create a model. A feature space consisting of plausible predictors of the far-field directional OASPL was defined, based on previous fundamental studies and jet noise scaling laws. On average, the ANN was able to predict the directional far-field OASPL within 0.75 dB, surpassing original goals. In addition to these topics, some limitations and possible extensions of the methods described herein are discussed.",58,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058148,"Next-generation fan designs featuring large bypass ratios have the potential to reduce rotor–stator interaction noise of fans. However, these designs pose new challenges and long-held beliefs regarding the acoustic benefit of such concepts that need to be evaluated. At off-design operating points, the increase in nozzle area serves to maintain the stall margin by reducing the fan loading. To an extent, this may lower the contribution of wake turbulence to fan broadband noise. Therefore, investigating the relative contribution of other noise sources becomes relevant. In this paper, the authors examine the contribution of wake and ingested turbulence to fan broadband noise levels at approach for the ASPIRE fan, which is a next-generation fan concept. To enable the investigation of background turbulence, a Reynolds stress turbulence model is used. The computational fluid dynamics solution then provides inputs for a two-dimensional cyclostationary synthetic turbulence method. The noise predictions are improved by performing simulations at three spanwise positions and by introducing a correction technique to account for the three-dimensional interstage flow. For the investigated case, it is shown that broadband noise generated at the stator is as high as for conventional concepts. Furthermore, both wake and background turbulence contribute significantly to the overall fan broadband noise.",58,2

Moreover, some components of sound within a viscothermal mean flow boundary layer over an acoustic lining may be amplified by a factor of in a typical aircraft engine compared with the sound outside the boundary layer, which may be expected to trigger nonlinear effects within the boundary layer. This is in addition to the well-known nonlinear effects within the holes of the perforated lining facing sheet. This paper presents a mathematical investigation into the effects of weak nonlinearity on the acoustics within a thin parallel mean flow boundary layer in flow over an acoustic lining in a cylindrical duct. (This is the first investigation of nonlinear acoustics in a boundary-layer flow over a nonrigid surface, to our knowledge.) In certain cases, a surprisingly large acoustic streaming effect is found that escapes the mean flow boundary layer and pervades well out into the interior of the duct.",58,2

High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics loose-coupling simulations were performed for air-load prediction using the high-fidelity rotorcraft aeromechanics simulation software Helios, and impulsive loading noise was simulated using the acoustic prediction software PSU-WOPWOP at eight microphones positioned below the lower rotor plane. No significant discrepancy in air-load and acoustic predictions was found between the three turbulence modeling cases [Spalart–Allmaras (SA)–Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, SA–detached-eddy simulation, and SA–delayed-detached-eddy simulation] with . It was found that the case showed a good convergence of impulsive loading noise at most microphones in terms of the wake-grid resolution. Isolated rotor simulations were also carried out to quantify the relative importance of the two impulsive loading-noise sources of a lift-offset coaxial rotor: self-blade–vortex interaction (BVI) and blade-crossover events. Contours of induced inflow ratio on the rotor disks revealed higher induced velocity for the lift-offset coaxial rotor than the isolated rotors. The higher induced flow ratio reduced the distribution of sectional normal force, strength of self-BVIs, and BVI noise of the lift-offset coaxial rotor. Even with the reduced BVI noise, the lift-offset coaxial rotor showed a dramatically higher impulsive sound-pressure level than the isolated rotors, especially at high speed, as a consequence of mainly blade-crossover events.",58,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057765,"Bypass transition in a boundary layer subjected to freestream turbulence and distributed surface roughness is studied numerically. The distributed surface roughness is reproduced with an immersed boundary technique, and the freestream turbulence is artificially generated by a superposition of eigenmodes of the Orr–Sommerfeld and Squire equations. Both an undisturbed laminar inflow and a disturbed inflow with freestream turbulence are studied. In either case a parametric study on the effects of the roughness size and density is carried out. The simulations reveal that the presence of roughness induces streaks in the laminar flow. When the freestream is turbulent, both roughness height and density show an impact on the onset of transition. The superposition of surface roughness and freestream turbulence causes amplified streaks. As a result, the streak instability occurs earlier within the boundary layer. The results show good qualitative and quantitative agreement to both experimental and numerical studies available in the literature.",58,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058535,"The wall-modeled large-eddy simulation branch of the widely used improved delayed detached-eddy simulation (IDDES) method is supposed to resolve the problems of log-layer mismatch and underprediction of skin friction, as claimed by the authors of the IDDES (Shur, M. L., Spalart, P. R., Strelets, M. K., and Travin, A. K., ""A Hybrid RANS-LES Model with Delayed DES and Wall-Modeled LES Capabilities,"" International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow, Vol. 29, 2008, pp. 1638–1649). But, some researchers did meet these problems when using the IDDES. Aiming at finding out the reason and seeking a remedy, an analysis of the IDDES is carried out that focuses on the relation between the wall-parallel grid size and the length scale of the energetic turbulent structures at the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)/large-eddy simulation (LES) interface, and it reveals that the flaw of the IDDES arises from the fact that, in the IDDES approach, the energetic, large-scale, and stress-carrying turbulent structures in the vicinity of the RANS/LES interface are essentially impossible to well resolve by the LES mode. On the basis of the analysis, a modification to the IDDES is proposed by moving the RANS/LES interface further away from the wall so that, at the RANS/LES interface, the wall-parallel grid size is sufficient to resolve the turbulent structures. The modification is simple in form but has clear physical meaning. Through a series of sensitivity tests, it can be concluded that the modified IDDES does resolve the problems of log-layer mismatch and underprediction of skin friction, and it is applicable to low-, moderate-, and high-Reynolds-number flat plate boundary-layer flows without exception.",58,2

Thus, there should exist a similarity parameter formed from these factors that will allow determination of the dynamics of the vortex rings/porous wall interaction. To find this similarity parameter, the effects of the Reynolds number (309–1238) and pore size (0.07–0.20) on the vortex rings/porous wall interaction are investigated by laser-induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. By dimensional analysis and quantitative investigation of PIV data, a similarity parameter is proposed to effectively characterize the losses in jet dynamical parameters, such as momentum flux, kinetic energy, and vortex ring circulation, due to impingement onto a porous wall. Physically, reflects the relative importance of the forces due to the momentum relative to the viscous forces, and the drag forces associated with the porous wall geometry.

Plasma flow control is an emerging type of active flow control technology that can be used to control asymmetric vortices over slender bodies by means of pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators. However, some problems worthy of further study remain unsolved. For example, the stimulation strength is inadequate, the region of discharge is small, and the control mechanism is unclear. This paper proposes a double-side sliding pulsed discharge (DSPD) plasma actuator that combines a sinusoidal alternating current (AC) pulsed plasma actuator with two high-voltage direct current (DC) components. This actuator can generate two groups of unsymmetrical large-scale coherent vortex structures to balance the vorticity of the asymmetric vortices over the slender forebody of an aircraft and increase the distance between the cores of the asymmetric vortices, weakening the interaction between the vortices and hindering the emergence of the asymmetric phenomenon. Focusing on the key scientific issue of DSPD plasma actuation, the discharge morphologies and electrical properties under different DC conditions are studied, and the unsteady vortex structures induced by the DSPD plasma actuator under a static atmosphere are revealed through high-speed schlieren system and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The flow control ability of the DSPD plasma actuator is verified through wind tunnel experiments, and the main rules governing its influence on the external flowfield are determined. It is speculated that this actuator will further improve the aerodynamic flow control of slender aircraft.",58,2

The flowfield induced by the actuator was studied in quiescent flow. The current–voltage characteristics and power requirements of the high-voltage circuit that powered the discharge were detailed at different operating power levels. A descending current–voltage characteristic typical for electric breakdown was identified. Schlieren visualization was used to study the thermal effects of the plasma on the surrounding air. The induced flow velocity close to the actuator face was directly related to the influence of the rotating discharge, whereas the flow farther away from the actuator face was dominated by thermal instabilities. Phase-locked stereoscopic particle image velocimetry data were acquired across seven evenly spaced planes perpendicular to the surface of the actuator at three different power levels. These data were used to reconstruct three-component volumetric-averaged velocity fields. The induced velocity by the plasma discharge was found to increase with supplied power.

The test article consisted of a fin with a 5 deg half-angle affixed to a half-cylinder with a 50 mm outer diameter placed in a Mach 2.5 freestream. The shock strength was small enough that the incoming boundary layer remained unseparated, allowing for direct investigation of the influence of 3-D relief on the SBLI. Complementary experimental and computational investigations were made to obtain a detailed understanding of the mean flow. The surface streaklines exhibited an inward tilt toward the fin root when compared to a planar configuration. Furthermore, the overall compression across the SBLI was always smaller than the planar configuration, and the compression magnitude monotonically decreased with downstream distance. Investigations of the offbody shock structure revealed an outboard curvature of the shock stem as it approached the cylinder surface and an associated decreased shock strength near the cylinder surface. The modified shock’s effects on the resulting overall compression became noticeable where the inviscid shock stem displayed weakening just above the boundary layer.",58,2

To cure the shock instability with a minimally increasing numerical dissipation, this study investigates the mechanisms of entropy fix and rotated Roe scheme and combines their complementary advantages. Thus, this paper proposes the Roe-ER scheme, which uses the rotated method to identify where the entropy fix is necessary. Therefore, the possible large dissipation of the rotated Roe scheme is replaced by the relatively small value of entropy fix, and areas that adopt the entropy fix are limited in regions where the shock instability may occur. Numerical cases validate the Roe-ER scheme, which is shock stable, features a low additional numerical dissipation, and can use high-order reconstruction to further reduce areas that activate the entropy fix.",58,2

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are first realized to compute the shocks in the vicinity of the fan. These shocks are then radiated in the near field thanks to computational aeroacoustics (CAA) simulations. The chaining between CFD and CAA simulations is done by injecting the shocks in terms of usual conservative variables using a nonreflecting boundary condition. The CAA solver is based on the nonlinearized Euler equations, which allows definition of the CFD/CAA interface close to the fan where the propagation of shocks is highly nonlinear. Both shock generation and propagation mechanisms are investigated, and the effects of inflow distortion are highlighted by comparison with a baseline case without distortion. The flow distortion is shown to be responsible for a modification of shock amplitudes along the circumferential direction. Thus, azimuthal modes appear in addition to the rotor-locked mode present without distortion. A particular feature of the studied configuration is the presence of a supersonic flow region in the bottom part of the nacelle. This supersonic pocket blocks the shocks in the lower half of the nacelle and modifies the angle at which they leave the nacelle in its upper half. Consequently, the far-field radiation (obtained using Kirchhoff’s integral method) is mainly oriented skyward and toward the side of descending blades.

A model consisting of a flat plate, a fin, and a transverse jet is tested using various experimental techniques at Mach 5 to investigate the complex interaction between the fin and the downstream jet. Schlieren and planar laser scattering are used to study the pattern of shock wave interactions and structures in the boundary layer, and pressure-sensitive paint is used to examine the pressure distribution on the flat plate. The results show that the state of the approaching boundary layer, the structure of the jet-induced bow shock, and the pressure distribution around the nozzle are sensitive to the position of the jet relative to the fin. The pressure around the nozzle exit is substantially increased in all three cases tested, and the highest peak pressure occurs when the jet is located after the fin-induced reattachment shock.

A shock generator deflected the flow by 10°, resulting in an oblique shock impinging on a flat plate. The shock triggered transition in the boundary layer and the formation of Görtler-like vortices downstream of reattachment. Heat flux and pressure distributions on the plate were measured globally using infrared thermography and pressure-sensitive paint. Oil film visualization was employed to evaluate the boundary-layer reattachment. Numerical results consist of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and fully laminar steady-state three-dimensional simulations. Shock-induced transition is considered to be the cause of the overshoot in peak pressure and peak heating of approximately 15%, in agreement with previous studies. Görtler instability, triggered by the concave nature of the bubble at separation, is identified as the main mechanism leading to boundary-layer transition, resulting in heat-flux variations of less than 30%. By comparing numerical results against thermographic values it is possible to delineate the extent of transition.

The new method discretizes the ruled shock surface into elements that can be derived from multiple locally conical flows. Multiple locally conical flows indicate that neighboring osculating planes have different shock generators. This feature not only provides a practical way to represent the azimuthal pressure gradients but also extends the variety of waverider designs. Waverider test cases at and are performed by the osculating cones with variable shock angles’ (OC-VSAs’) method and the multiple-OCs’ method, respectively. It has been shown that the multiple-OCs’ method is applicable to more generalized shock surfaces. The comparison results reveal that the waverider derived by the multiple-OCs’ method has a better agreement with the computational fluid dynamics solution than the OC-VSAs’ method. Moreover, the new method ensures a more homogeneous inlet captured flowfield on the bottom side of the waverider, which is favorable for hypersonic airframe propulsion integration.",58,2

Although the structural deformation and aerodynamic loadings during the morphing process directly affect the skin structure, the design of the morphing skin has been overlooked. Five design criteria for the morphing skin of a variable camber compliant wing were derived from structural analysis results and reference values. According to the evaluation of conventional lattice structures, it is concluded that there is an absolute need for a new structure that satisfies the required design criteria.",58,2
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058485,"This paper studies a multifidelity resource optimization methodology for simulation and data collection in the calibration of dynamics model parameters. Nonlinear dynamics systems require high-fidelity modeling; however, expensive high-fidelity simulations cannot be used in Bayesian model calibration: Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling requires thousands of runs to calculate the posterior distributions. The use of low-fidelity modeling is also not appropriate, because it leads to significant error in calibration. A multifidelity approach is pursued, where a limited number of high-fidelity runs are used to improve a low-fidelity-based surrogate model, resulting in stronger physics-informed priors for calibration with experimental data. Two optimization approaches are studied: the first selects high-fidelity model runs that maximize the information gain in the modeling stage within the multifidelity approach, and the second selects the number and location of the sensors in the experimental setup to maximize the information gain from the experiments. The proposed methodologies are illustrated for a curved panel subjected to acoustic and nonuniform thermal loading. Two models of different fidelity are employed to calibrate the damping and model errors. The optimization methodology considers two complicating factors: 1) the damping behavior is input-dependent, and 2) the sensor uncertainty is affected by temperature.",58,2
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058388,"This paper presents a methodology to support improved decision making and identification of risks in early stage multidisciplinary design. The approach fuses multifidelity data from disparate information sources available to designers, such as disciplinary simulations, experiments, and operational data from previously deployed systems. The multifidelity data fusion is achieved using a fidelity-weighted combination of Gaussian process surrogate models. This weighting takes into account both the quality of the Gaussian process approximation and the designer’s confidence in the underlying information source being approximated. The resulting multifidelity surrogate provides a rapid analysis capability, which in turn enables the high number of evaluations needed to conduct multidisciplinary trade studies and to propagate uncertainty to the overall system level. The methodology is broadly applicable across engineering design problems where multiple information sources are available to support design decisions. In this paper, the approach is demonstrated on the stability and control analysis of a Blended-Wing-Body aircraft’s center-of-gravity limits, considering the longitudinal criteria of fly-to-stall, stall recovery, nose-wheel steering, and nose-wheel liftoff. The results show that low-fidelity models are enhanced by the presence of higher-fidelity data in key areas of the design space. The presence of even sparse high-fidelity data is key to reducing the variance in the overall analysis, thereby improving the quality of the predictions needed to inform early stage design decisions.",58,2
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058536,"In this research, a new analytical solution for finding the buckling loads of thin orthotropic rectangular plates with different boundary conditions is derived. The methods currently known in the literature for finding the buckling loads of plates are mainly numerical. Although some plates with specific boundary conditions have analytical solutions, a comprehensive analytical method providing analytical solutions that fit all possible combinations of boundary conditions is lacking. The solution method in this study is based on the development of a static solution for a plate. The physical meaning of buckling is the loss of stiffness, and it is found as the value of the in-plane loading intensity at which a zero force on the plate surface will generate infinite displacement. The solution is obtained in series form, and the coefficients are solved to match the edge conditions. The solution presented for this plate will fit different boundary conditions of the deflection, slope, shear force, and bending moment along the common edges of neighboring plates. Using this new method, exact buckling loads and the buckling modes of many new cases of classical boundary conditions are found (cases involving clamped, simply supported, guided, and free boundaries). Results are given for several stiffness ratios in both directions of the plate, as well as for unidirectional and several cases of bidirectional loading.",58,2
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058413,"This study starts with defining generalized displacements. Together with the assumptions and shear-stress-free conditions, the in-plane displacements of a functionally graded (FG) plate are first mathematically assumed, and then orthogonally decomposed into three terms with the aid of a neutral surface. The generalized stresses are accordingly defined, and the constitutive relations are derived for an FG plate after the generalized strains are measured. The principles of virtual work (PVW) are eventually expressed for FG plate problems. Compared with the previous work in this field, due to the use of frame-indifferent generalized displacements, the in-plane displacements are physically interpreted as tension part, bending part, and high-order bending part. Because of the use of frame-indifferent generalized stresses and generalized strains, mutual couplings of tension, bending, and higher-order bending are removed in the constitutive relations. More important, the lower-order theory of an FG plate is mathematically correlated with the higher-order theory from the viewpoint of PVW. With these fundamentals, finite element formulations are derived and two kinds of plate elements are constructed. Typical examples show that the elements can yield satisfactory deflection and rotation, whereas the high-order element can also capture the boundary effect of shear force at the clamped edge.",58,2
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058422,"Algorithms for the first- and second-order sensitivities of the complex mode for an asymmetrical damped linear discrete dynamic system with respect to design parameters are presented. The first- and second-order sensitivities are used to construct the gradient matrix and the Hessian matrix of the complex mode and to establish its Taylor approximation of the second degree. The symmetrical dynamic system possesses a set of biorthonormal right modes so that the two-sided normalization method is engaged. In contrast, in an asymmetrical dynamic system, the two-sided normalization technique is not effective. In our presentation, the results are derived in terms of a complex mode so that the uniqueness of the complex mode and its sensitivities are kept. The algorithms make the calculations more precise and easier to perform. The usefulness and stability of the derived expressions are demonstrated by considering a half-car model of 7 degrees and a whirling beam of 10 degrees.",58,2
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056885,"Elishakoff et al. once proposed a novel physics-based, low-frequency correction to the Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theory. The corrected beam theory is simpler than the classical one because it leads to a single frequency series in the vibrating analysis, without loss of the effect of shear deformation and rotary inertia. In this paper, a further modification is proposed based on Elishakoff’s correction such that the resulting single frequency series fits quite well with the first branch of the Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beam theory up to a relatively high frequency (i.e., the cutoff frequency of Timoshenko–Ehrenfest beams). Most strikingly, the present modification is found to be suitable not only for homogeneous and uniform beams but also for a wide class of beam structures with axial inhomogeneity and/or variable cross section. An inhomogeneous and nonuniform beam with two sharp ends is analytically studied in detail using several different engineering beam models, which fully verifies the necessity and high accuracy of the present modification, particularly for beam structures composed of materials with negative Poisson’s ratio.",58,2
35,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059002,"This paper presents a theoretical investigation on the free vibration of a symmetric beam consisting of an aluminum core coated with functionally graded material. The elastic modulus and density are varied throughout the thickness of the coating material with both a polynomial and an exponential function, whereas a classical lamination theory is applied to determine the effective elastic modulus and density. To model the gradually changing mechanical properties in a truthful way, the coating is represented by 25 layers of material, whereas each layer itself is homogeneous and isotropic. To obtain a numerical solution, the Timoshenko finite element model beam theory (which also takes first-order shear deformation effects into account) is used. For this purpose, a finite element code is written in MATLAB and the natural frequencies of the beam are found. A detailed parametric study is conducted to show the influences of the core thickness to beam height ratio , the beam span to height ratio , the exponential function and power law index , and multiple boundary conditions on the natural beam frequencies. It was observed that the studied parameters had a significant effect on the natural frequencies.",58,2
36,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058230,"Micro air vehicles are used for both civil and military applications, like rescue or surveillance. The aerodynamic performance of the rotor is known to be lower than for classical large rotors, due to increased drag at low Reynolds numbers. However, the rotor performance can be improved by taking advantage of the flow unsteadiness and considering unsteady rotor kinematics, like a periodic variation of the rotor pitch. To study such behaviors, it is necessary to develop numerical methods adapted to these fluid–structure interaction phenomena, which are the main objectives of this paper. The method relies on the implementation of fluid–structure interaction capabilities in a lattice–Boltzmann flow solver, which is implemented in a monolithic fashion using generalized coordinates. The validation is first conducted on a vortex-induced vibration test case. Then, numerical simulations are performed for a rotor test case 1) with a forced motion and 2) by coupling the flow with the equation of the dynamics. Some semianalytical models are derived and validated against the numerical simulations to predict the effects of pitching, flapping, and surging on the thrust. The results show that flapping and surging significantly increase the rotor thrust, but at the price of a penalty on the power consumption.",58,2
37,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058503,"The damage behavior of a helicopter rotor blade made of carbon fiber polymer composite has been numerically investigated using a synergistic damage mechanics (SDM) model. Laminates of the quasi-isotropic stacking sequence have been considered in this study. The simulations were performed, corresponding to a hovering condition and for a range of the angles of attack and rotational speeds of the blade. The aerodynamic and centrifugal loads due to different angles of attack and rotational speeds have been computed by using fluid dynamics simulations. A structural analysis was then performed using the aerodynamic loads. Using the SDM model, the matrix crack density and crack multiplication were evaluated to predict the damage initiation site and maximum crack density occurring in the plies of the laminate under the operational conditions. It was observed that maximum crack appeared in the blade at extreme operational conditions; among the different plies, a ply was cracked by the maximum amount. A crack density of around was predicted in the ply at an operational condition with a 500 rpm blade rotation and an 18 deg angle of attack of the blade. The present study demonstrates application of the progressive damage modeling in designing a composite helicopter blade by considering its performance parameters.",58,2
