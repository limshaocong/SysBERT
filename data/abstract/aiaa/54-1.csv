2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054090,"The present work presents a brief review of some of the notable contributions to piston theory and of its theoretical basis. A generalized formulation of piston theory is given, applicable to both local and classical piston theory. A consistent generalized formulation of the downwash equation is given, accounting for arbitrary motion in the plane of the airfoil. The formulation reduces to established downwash equations through appropriate definition of the cylinder orientation. The theoretical range of validity of classical piston theory is examined, and the relative accuracy of a number of approximate theories encapsulated by the formulation as applied to a planar wedge is considered. The relative importance of higher order terms in piston theory is examined, with the significance of recent literature extending the fidelity of the first-order term highlighted. It is subsequently suggested that current implementations of local piston theory may be improved through the use of a first-order term of suitable accuracy.",54,1

A flow plug is placed at the duct exit to simulate the combustion induced high pressure and to initiate the inlet unstart. High-speed schlieren imaging and time-resolved pressure measurements are used simultaneously to record the unsteady flow structures and surface pressures of the unstart process. The inlet operates in a big buzz mode with a base frequency of 30 Hz and exhibits a series of unsteady flow patterns similar to those of rectangular hypersonic inlets in a buzz cycle when the throttling ratio is 87.4%. During the upstream propagating process of the unstart shock system, the propagation velocity in the two ends of the duct is higher than that in the middle section of the duct, with a minimum value around the isolator. Once the separation bubble induced oblique shock is expelled over the cowl lip, a supersonic reverse flow with a Mach number of 1.56 is observed in the contracting part of the inlet, which acts as an inverted supersonic nozzle. When the external unstart shock system moves back toward the cowl lip, two kinds of secondary oscillations with high dominant frequencies of about 360 Hz and 900–1300 Hz are observed in turn by the time-accurate pressure system. The two mentioned secondary oscillations are both acoustic resonance modes formed in different parts of the duct.",54,1

The roughness-based transition control involves controlled seeding of suitable, subdominant crossflow modes to weaken the growth of naturally occurring, linearly more unstable instability modes via a nonlinear modification of the mean boundary-layer profiles. Therefore, a synthesis of receptivity, linear and nonlinear growth of crossflow disturbances, and high-frequency secondary instabilities becomes desirable to model this form of control. Because experimental data are currently unavailable for passive crossflow-transition control on high-Reynolds-number configurations, a holistic computational approach is used to assess the feasibility of roughness-based-control methodology. The potential challenges inherent to this control application, as well as the associated difficulties in modeling this form of control in a computational setting, are highlighted. At high Reynolds numbers, a broad spectrum of stationary-crossflow disturbances have large-enough linear amplification to cause transition, and, while it may be possible to control a specific target mode using discrete roughness elements, the nonlinear interaction between the control and target modes may yield strong amplification of the difference mode and, hence, produce an adverse impact on the transition delay using spanwise periodic roughness elements.",54,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054139,"An accurate prediction of transition onset behind an isolated roughness element has not yet been established. This is particularly important in hypersonic flow, where transition is accompanied by increased surface heating. In the present contribution, a number of direct numerical simulations have been performed of a Mach 6 boundary layer over a flat plate with isolated roughness elements. The effects of roughness shape, planform, ramps, and freestream disturbance levels on instability growth and transition onset are investigated. It is found that the frontal shape has a large effect on the transition onset, which is in agreement with previous studies, whereas the roughness element planform has a marginal influence. A new result is that the roughness shape in the streamwise direction (in particular, the aft section) is also an important characteristic, since an element with a ramped-down aft section allows the detached shear layer to spread out and weaken, leading to a lower instability growth rate. Above a critical value, the instability growth rate is found to be correlated with the amplitude of the low-speed streak formed by the roughness element, suggesting that a more physically based transition criterion should take account of the local liftup effect of the particular roughness shape.",54,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054112,"Two-dimensional direct numerical simulations are used to study the impact of deep gaps on laminar–turbulent transition in compressible boundary-layer flow. For these, the gap depth-to-width ratio is always larger than five. They are located on a flat plate without pressure gradient. A steady base flow is used with a Mach number of 0.6, free-stream temperature of 288 K, and free-stream pressure of 1 bar. Subsequently, Tollmien–Schlichting waves are introduced by suction and blowing at the wall, and their growth over the gap is evaluated by factors. The influence of the gap on laminar–turbulent transition is quantified by the difference compared with the factor obtained for a flat plate without gap. A periodic influence of the gap depth on is observed. In the direct numerical simulations, acoustic waves enter the gap and form a standing wave due to reflections, similar as occurring in organ pipes. The feedback of the standing wave on the boundary-layer flow above is essential for the observed variations. In a second case, the influence of a specific gap placed in front of a forward-facing step is studied as well. Here, a reduction of the factor and hence a delay of transition, relative to the flow with step alone, are reached due to the presence of the gap.",54,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054115,"A set of compact disturbance equations is developed for high-accuracy and efficient aeroacoustic simulations. The compact disturbance equations in their complete form are an exact rearrangement of the Navier–Stokes equations, but incorporate various linear and nonlinear disturbance equations such as the linearized Euler equations and the linearized Navier–Stokes equations. Their attractive mathematical properties facilitate the implementations of the full compact disturbance equations and the reduced equations in essentially the same form as in existing computational fluid dynamics solvers with minor modifications. A high-resolution unsteady simulation in a reduced domain can be embedded inside a less-expensive Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solution of flow in a larger, possibly very complex, configuration. This results in a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation method with reduced meshing difficulties and computational costs, but improved grid qualities and more accurate boundary treatments for complex configurations. Furthermore, a seamless switch can be made between the embedded governing equations. This enables a novel closely coupled computational fluid dynamics/computational aeroacoustics approach for complex aeroacoustic applications, where the full Navier–Stokes equations can be recovered in the source region to capture the turbulent noise sources and the linearized Euler equations can be applied to simulate the noise propagation and possible reflection more accurately and efficiently. These benefits are demonstrated with three benchmark tests and excellent results are obtained.",54,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054127,"Aircraft have evolved into extremely complex systems that require adapted methodologies and tools for efficient design processes. A theoretical formulation based on exergy management has been recently proposed by Arntz et al. for assessing the aerothermopropulsive performance of future aircraft configurations. The present article focuses on the validation of its numerical implementation in a FORTRAN code for the postprocessing of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow solutions. The flow around the wing-body NASA Common Research Model is assessed in terms of anergy destruction. A 2 MW work potential associated with the lift-induced vortices is identified in the wake of the airplane. Subsequently, a six-level grid convergence study enables determining the robustness and accuracy of the exergy postprocessing code. The introduction and calibration of a numerical correction allows to account for the spurious numerical vortex dissipation and to obtain an accuracy similar to the traditional near-field drag method. Finally, the postprocessing code is validated for drag prediction against computational fluid dynamics and experimental wind-tunnel data.",54,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054138,"A high-order implicit large-eddy simulation method in two dimensions and three dimensions is used to simulate the aerodynamics of a NACA0012 airfoil over large angles of attack at low chord Reynolds numbers . The two-dimensional code is found to have adequate agreement with lift and drag experimental data for prestall angles of attack, whereas the three-dimensional code is validated over all angles of attack. The three-dimensional method is able to accurately predict the magnitude and frequency content of the lift and drag forces on the airfoil throughout the range of Reynolds numbers considered in this study. Further comparisons to experimental data are made, including particle image velocimetry vorticity data as well as dye-injection data. As an extension of this application, a section of a constant spinning straight-bladed vertical-axis wind turbine with two blades at a similar Reynolds number is subject to various inflow velocities in two dimensions and three dimensions. The pitch angle of the blades was also varied in order to take into account the uncertainties in the mounting angle of the blade in the experimental studies. As found previously, a small toe-out angle can increase the power absorption of the turbine on the order of 10%. The computed tangential forces as a function of the azimuthal angle agree much better with the experimental data at high tip-speed ratios as compared to other lower-fidelity analytical turbine codes.",54,1
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054154,"The aerodynamic shape optimization of wings in transonic flow is an inherently challenging problem. In addition to the high computational cost of solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, there is a complex interdependence between the cross-sectional shape, wave drag, and viscous effects. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform multipoint optimizations to ensure good performance for a range of flight conditions. The choice of which flight conditions should be considered in a multipoint optimization and how many of these should be considered is still not well understood. This paper addresses this issue by solving a series of seven benchmark optimizations developed by the AIAA Aerodynamic Optimization Discussion Group. These optimization cases include a single-point optimization, four three-point optimizations, a nine-point optimization, and a five-point optimization. The optimizations consist in minimizing the weighted drag coefficient subject to lift, moment, thickness, and volume constraints. The optimizations were performed with respect to 768 shape design variables and an angle of attack for each flight condition. The single-point optimization was able to achieve an 8.1% drag reduction relative to the initial design, but it exhibited poor off-design performance. All the optimized designs were compared using a contour plot of to evaluate the wing performance over the complete transonic flight operating envelope. Each of the four three-point optimizations successfully mitigated the poor off-design performance of the single-point design. However, the three-point optimization with widely spaced Mach numbers yielded a much more complex contour with two distinct local maxima. Finally, the five- and nine-point optimizations yielded similar performance and the most robust off-design performance.",54,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054153,"Large-eddy simulations are carried out to investigate plasma-based flow control that is used to delay transition generated by excrescence on the leading edge of a wing. The wing airfoil section has a geometry that is representative of modern reconnaissance air vehicles and has an appreciable region of laminar flow at design conditions. Modification of the leading edge, which can be caused by the accumulation of debris, insect impacts, microscopic ice crystal formation, damage, or structural fatigue, may result in premature transition and an increase in drag. A dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator, located downstream of the excrescence, is employed to mitigate transition, decrease drag, and increase energy efficiency. Numerical solutions are obtained to the Navier–Stokes equations that were augmented by source terms used to represent the body force imparted by the plasma actuator on the fluid. A simple phenomenological model provided this force resulting from the electric field generated by the plasma. The numerical method is based upon a high-fidelity numerical scheme and an implicit time-marching approach. An overset mesh system is employed to represent excrescence in the leading-edge region. Solutions are generated for both uniform and distributed excrescence geometries, as well as for the clean wing configuration without leading-edge modification. Results are obtained for two different values of the plasma field strength. Features of the computational flowfields are elucidated, and the effectiveness of control is quantified by comparison with baseline results without plasma actuation. It is found that plasma control can reestablish the laminar flow region lost to excrescence-generated transition and increase the lift-to-drag ratio by up to 8.7%.",54,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054157,"Flow control experiments were performed using nanosecond dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuators on a NACA 0015 airfoil with flow approaching from the geometric trailing-edge side, which is a condition anticipated to occur on the retreating blade side of advanced helicopters such as slowed-rotor compound rotorcraft. This symmetric airfoil, which is not typical of those used in rotorcraft blades, was used for simplification of an otherwise very complex problem. The Reynolds number based on the chord length was fixed at , corresponding to a freestream flow of approximately . An angle of attack of 15 deg was used. Fully separated flow on the suction side extended well beyond the airfoil with naturally shed vortices occurring at a Strouhal number of 0.19. Plasma actuation was evaluated at both the aerodynamic leading and trailing edges of the airfoil. Excitation at very low (impulse excitation) to moderate Strouhal numbers at the aerodynamic leading edge generated organized coherent structures in the shear layer over the separated region with a shedding Strouhal number corresponding to that of the excitation, which caused changes in the size of the wake, the separation area, lift, and drag. Excitation at higher Strouhal numbers resulted in weaker naturally shed vortices (rather than generating new vortices) that diffused quickly in the wake. The excitation caused the wake to elongate slightly and skew toward the aerodynamic trailing edge, but it still reduced the separation area and significantly reduced drag. The primary mechanism of control at the aerodynamic leading edge is excitation of instabilities associated with the leading-edge vortices; the excitation generates coherent large-scale structures over a range of excitation frequencies, increasing their entrainment abilities to bring high-momentum fluid into the separation region to reduce the separation size and increase the lift. On the other hand, excitation over a broad range of frequencies at the aerodynamic trailing edge was found to significantly reduce organization of the naturally shed large-scale wake structures.",54,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054114,"The behavior of projectiles at Mach 0.9, 1.1, and 1.2 when in close proximity to a surface were investigated using a synergy of live-range test firings, wind-tunnel experiments, and computational fluid dynamics simulations; the latter provided the majority of the insight into the problem. Building on work that previously indicated significant ground influence for a projectile at Mach 2.4 due to shock reflections, a similar projectile was investigated for ground clearances of height-to-diameter ratios from 0.25 to 8. It was found that at Mach 0.9 the projectile’s drag, normal force, and pitching moment coefficients changed predictably, and with significant increasing magnitude below . Drag increased, a strong normal (suction) force acting toward the ground developed with increasing strength of the shock developing on the lower side of the projectile, and a nose-up pitching tendency was established. At the supersonic Mach numbers, the ground influence was present at higher ground clearances, and influential shock reflections occurred; at high clearances, the reflected shock increased the pressure on the lower side, and at low clearances , the reflecting expansion waves lowered the pressure to produce a pronounced negative normal force. At the lowest investigated clearances, drag was approximately 30% higher, and the Mach 1.2 cases experienced more substantial fluctuations in the trends. The normal force and pitching moment behaviors would be unlikely to influence the projectile’s path over any realistic distance, but the ground proximity drag increase would significantly alter the projectile’s deceleration and therefore trajectory response.",54,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054123,"A method for injection of gas into the boundary layer on a slender body in supersonic flow while minimizing perturbation to the mean flow is examined. Injection of gas is equivalent to a sudden increase in the displacement thickness of the boundary layer, which produces an oblique shock that propagates into the inviscid region of the flow. It is found that modification of the geometry of the body can compensate for the increased displacement thickness created by injection and minimize the production of oblique waves. However, the resulting near-wall injection layer is observed to be unstable and a turbulent boundary layer develops downstream of the injection region. The instability of the flow is examined experimentally using high-speed schlieren visualization and numerically using linear stability analysis of velocity profiles from a compressible Navier–Stokes computation. At the present postshock Mach number of about 3.8, both first- and second-mode instabilities are active, though computations predict that the first mode is primarily responsible for transition downstream of the injector.",54,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054166,"Empirical and analytical means have been used in this work to explore the dynamic response characteristics of polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paint. An acoustic resonance tube was used to understand the effect of surface roughness on the frequency response of the polymer/ceramic pressure-sensitive paint coating. Steady-state lifetime measurements were also performed. A model based on diffusion, excited-state-luminophore population dynamics, and attenuation of excitation light was derived and numerically implemented. Inclusion of light attenuation in the model improved the accuracy of the simulation and, on comparison with experimental data, was used to obtain characteristic parameters of the paint coating.",54,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054121,"At early design phases, taking into account uncertainty in the optimization of a multidisciplinary system is essential to assess the optimal characteristics and performance. Uncertainty multidisciplinary design optimization methods aim at efficiently organizing not only the different disciplinary analyses, the uncertainty propagation, and the optimization but also the handling of interdisciplinary couplings under uncertainty. A new decoupled uncertainty multidisciplinary design optimization formulation (named Individual Discipline Feasible/Polynomial Chaos Expansion) ensuring the coupling satisfaction for all the realizations of the uncertain variables is presented in this paper. Coupling satisfaction in realizations is necessary to maintain the equivalence between the coupled and decoupled uncertainty multidisciplinary design optimization formulations, and therefore to ensure the physical relevance of the obtained designs. The proposed approach relies on the iterative construction of Polynomial Chaos Expansions in order to represent, at the convergence of the optimization problem, the functional couplings between the disciplines. The proposed formulation is tested on an analytic problem and on the design of a two-stage launch vehicle.",54,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054191,"This paper will present details of a pressure-sensitive paint system for measuring global surface pressures on rotor blades in simulated forward flight at the subsonic tunnel at the NASA Langley Research Center. The system was designed to use a pulsed laser as an excitation source and pressure-sensitive paint data were collected using the lifetime-based approach. The higher intensity of the laser allowed pressure-sensitive paint images to be acquired using a single laser pulse, resulting in a collection of images that can be used to determine blade pressure at a specific instant in time. This is extremely important in rotorcraft applications because the blades experience dramatically different flowfields depending on their position. In addition, there can be fluctuations on the blade that vary every cycle due to factors such as lead/lag, flapping, and twisting of the blade. These effects generally preclude the use of phase averaging and thus the need for acquiring the data in a single image pair. For this test, the entire upper surface of a blade was painted and imaged. After taking into account temperature effects on the pressure-sensitive paint, the results agree both qualitatively and quantitatively with both expected results as well as with pressure transducers. Several limitations of the technique have been identified and discussion of strategies to overcome them is also presented.",54,1
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054199,"The immersed boundary method is used to simulate the flow around a two-dimensional cross section of a rotating NACA 0018 airfoil in order to investigate the dynamic stall occurring on a vertical axis wind turbine. The influence of dynamic stall on the force is characterized as a function of tip-speed ratio and Rossby number. The influence of the Coriolis effect is isolated by comparing the rotating airfoil to one undergoing an equivalent planar motion that is composed of surging and pitching motions that produce an equivalent speed and angle-of-attack variation over the cycle. Planar motions consisting of sinusoidally varying pitch and surge are also examined. At lower tip-speed ratios, the Coriolis force leads to the capture of a vortex pair when the angle of attack of a rotating airfoil begins to decrease in the upwind half cycle. This wake-capturing phenomenon leads to a significant decrease in lift during the downstroke phase. The appearance of this feature depends subtly on the tip-speed ratio. On the one hand, it is strengthened due to the intensifying Coriolis force, but on the other hand, it is attenuated because of the comitant decrease in angle of attack. While the present results are restricted to two-dimensional flow at low Reynolds numbers, they compare favorably with experimental observations at much higher Reynolds numbers. Moreover, the wake-capturing is observed only when the combination of surging, pitching, and Coriolis force is present.",54,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054164,"Based on the Carrera unified formulation, this work extends variable kinematic finite beam elements to include load factors and nonstructural masses for the static and vibration analyses of complex, metallic wing structures. According to the Carrera unified formulation, variable kinematic beam theories are formulated in an automatic and hierarchical manner by expressing the displacement field as an arbitrary expansion through generic cross-sectional functions. Both Taylor-like and Lagrange polynomials are used in this paper to develop refined beam kinematics, and the related theories are referred to as Taylor expansion and Lagrange expansion, respectively. The generalized unknowns of Taylor expansion models are the beam axis displacements and the -order displacement derivatives, with being a free parameter of the analysis. Classical beam theories are clearly particular cases of the linear Taylor expansion model. On the other hand, Lagrange expansion models have only pure translational displacements as unknowns. By exploiting this characteristic of Lagrange expansion, a componentwise approach is implemented and used for the analysis of multicomponent reinforced-shell structures. Numerical applications are developed by classical finite element procedures, and both static response and free vibration analyses are addressed. Various configurations of a benchmark wing are considered, and the capabilities of the present methodologies when dealing with higher-order effects due to deformable cross sections and geometrical discontinuities (for example, underside windows) are evaluated. The attention is focused on the applicability of the present refined beam models to problems involving complex, external inertial loadings. The results are compared to finite element solutions from commercial tools, including full three-dimensional models and models obtained by assembling two-dimensional shell and one-dimensional finite elements.",54,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054243,"This paper presents an experimental study on open rotor noise shielding by hybrid-wing-body aircraft, with the objective of understanding the noise shielding features and establishing methods of applying the shielding data for system noise studies of hybrid-wing-body aircraft. By studying the directivity patterns of individual tones, it is shown that, although the tonal energy distribution and the spectral content of the wind-tunnel test model (and thus its total noise) may differ from those of more advanced rotor designs, the individual tones follow directivity patterns that characterize far-field radiations of modern open rotors, establishing the validity of the use of this shielding database, provided that the shielding effects are applied on individual tones. To this end, open rotor tonal noise shielding is categorized into front rotor tones, aft rotor tones, and interaction tones: not only because of their different directivities but also due to the differences in their source locations and coherence features, which make their respective shielding characteristics distinctly different from each other. To reveal the parametric trends of the hybrid-wing-body shielding effects, results are presented with variations in frequency, far-field emission angle, rotor operational condition, engine installation, and local airframe features.",54,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054252,"The spatial evolution of acoustic waveforms produced by a laboratory-scale Mach 3 jet are investigated using both and . pressure field microphones located along rays emanating from the postpotential core where the peak sound emission is found to occur. The measurements are acquired in a fully anechoic chamber, where ground or other large surface reflections are minimal. Various statistical metrics are examined along the peak emission path, where they are shown to undergo rapid changes within 2 m from the source region. An experimentally validated wave-packet model is then used to confirm the location where the pressure amplitude along the peak emission path transitions from cylindrical to spherical decay. Various source amplitudes, provided by the wave-packet model, are then used to estimate shock formation distance and Gol’dberg numbers for diverging waves. The findings suggest that cumulative nonlinear distortion is likely to occur at laboratory scale near the jet flow, where the waveform amplitude decays cylindrically, but less likely to occur farther from the jet flow, where the waveform amplitude decays spherically. Direct inspection of the raw time series reveals how steepened waveforms are generated by roguelike waves that form from the constructive interference of waves from neighboring sources as opposed to classical cumulative nonlinear distortion.",54,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054167,"A new mode-matching method is developed for acoustic modes in axially sectioned lined ducts with parallel, but otherwise arbitrary mean flow. The method is evaluated in detail for a circularly symmetric configuration (where the mean flow depends only on the radial coordinate), with the so-called Pridmore-Brown modes, satisfying the radial Pridmore-Brown equation. Classically, the matching of the modal representations at the interfaces between the sections is based on continuity of pressure and velocity in combination with projection to a suitable but unrelated set of test functions by means of a standard integral inner product. The alternative proposed here uses essentially the same Pridmore-Brown modes, but instead of the standard inner product it applies a particular bilinear form that can be evaluated in closed form. Apart from numerical efficiency, this approach features also a higher accuracy because it avoids the inherently inaccurate numerical quadrature of oscillating functions. The results are compared with results obtained by an implementation of the classical approach, and the agreement is excellent, with higher accuracy and with greater computational efficiency.",54,1
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054265,"Advanced structural models, based on variable one-, two-, and three-dimensional kinematics, are proposed in this paper and applied to the analysis of the free vibration of reinforced aircraft shell structures. The used models go beyond classical structural theories, that is, Euler–Bernoulli (for one-dimensional beams) and Kirchhoff (for two-dimensional plates) type assumptions. The order of the expansion of the displacement fields over the cross section (one-dimensional case) and along the plate thickness (two-dimensional case) is, in fact, a free parameter of the problem. In this paper, Lagrange polynomials are used to build such expansions, and as a consequence, only displacements are used as the problem unknowns (no rotations or derivatives of displacements, which are typical of one-dimensional/two-dimensional classical theories, are introduced). The finite-element method is used to provide numerical solutions. The related arrays and the governing dynamical equations are written in terms of a few fundamental nuclei according to the Carrera unified formulation. Classical three-dimensional finite-element solid models are also considered. One-, two-, and three-dimensional finite elements are easily connected to each other to make the most appropriate computational model of the reinforced shell structures. The capability to use the same fundamental nucleus to derive finite-element matrices of one-, two-, and three-dimensional elements of the present model is unique because it is usually not available in other finite-element formulations, that is, no ad hoc techniques are required in the present case to couple finite elements with different kinematics. Three main benchmarks have been analyzed: a plate stiffened by means of bidirectional I-stiffeners, a simplified model of a complete aircraft, and a fuselage–wing connection. Comparison with commercial finite-element software (MSC Nastran) is provided for most of the quoted numerical investigations. The modal assurance criterion has been used to compare the free-vibration modes of the different models. The present mathematical models appear closer to reality and cheaper, from the computational point of view, than those of other existing formulations. Carrera unified-formulation-based finite elements do not require the definition of virtual lines (beam axes) or virtual surfaces (plate reference surfaces), and only physical lines/surfaces are therefore used.",54,1

Aeroelastic strength and panel buckling constraints are imposed across several trimmed maneuver loads, in addition to flutter constraints. Tailoring with metallic thickness variations, functionally graded materials, composite laminates, tow steering within composite laminates, and distributed trailing-edge control effectors are all found to provide reductions in structural wing mass with varying degrees of success. The question as to whether this wing mass reduction will offset the increased manufacturing cost is left unresolved for each case.",54,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054230,"A mathematical relation is formulated to calculate the properties of oblique shocks generated from swept ramps. Ramp sweep extends the oblique shock relations from two to three dimensions in a manner analogous to the way unswept ramp deflection extends the Rankine–Hugoniot shock relations from one to two dimensions. A new theta–beta–Mach-sweep (–Mach-sweep) relation is formulated, which reduces to the standard theta–beta–Mach (–Mach) relation for the special case of two-dimensional shocks from unswept ramps. The swept formulation may be expressed as a cubic equation with coefficients that are simple modifications of the cubic coefficients for the standard unswept formulation. The solution of this swept cubic equation allows the shock angle and downstream properties to be determined directly from the upstream Mach number, geometric ramp angle, and sweep. Several notable properties of sweep on the “strong” and “weak” solutions are depicted and discussed. The new formulation simplifies the process of placing, aligning, and focusing shocks for a sequence of swept ramps.",54,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054273,"The flow over an aircraft bay is often represented using a rectangular cavity; however, this simplification neglects many features of actual flight geometry that could affect the unsteady pressure field and resulting loading in the bay. To address this shortcoming, a complex cavity geometry was developed to incorporate more realistic aircraft-bay features including shaped inlets, internal cavity structure, and doors. A parametric study of these features was conducted based on fluctuating pressure measurements at subsonic and supersonic Mach numbers. Resonance frequencies and amplitudes increased in the complex geometry compared to a simple rectangular cavity that could produce severe loading conditions for store carriage. High-frequency content and dominant frequencies were generated by features that constricted the flow such as leading-edge overhangs, internal cavity variations, and the presence of closed doors. Broadband frequency components measured at the aft wall of the complex cavities were also significantly higher than in the rectangular geometry. These changes highlight the need to consider complex geometric effects when predicting the flight loading of aircraft bays.",54,1
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054272,"The Winslow elliptic smoothing equations have been shown to be effective for smoothing structured and unstructured computational meshes used in computational fluid dynamics applications. Although an implicit computational space is readily available for structured meshes, an explicitly constructed space is required for unstructured meshes. For a three-dimensional mesh, a method is presented where the original physical space is manipulated to generate virtual control volumes that can be employed as an effective computational space. A two-phase volume deformation scheme is implemented to effectively address mesh requirements for the viscous region near a no-slip slip surface. Region-limited smoothing is employed to fine tune the mesh smoothing to specific areas of interest and greatly increase the efficiency of the overall process. A tool called MeshGrind is used to demonstrate elliptic mesh manipulation and smoothing on practical engineering applications. Several test cases demonstrate Winslow elliptic smoothing on unstructured meshes including bioinspired flapping wing applications, design optimization, and dynamically deforming nozzles.

28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054280,"A mathematical model is developed for the prediction of broadband shock-associated noise in the presence of an airframe body. Model arguments are dependent on the vector Green’s function of the linearized Euler equations, steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions, and the two-point cross-correlation of the equivalent source. The equivalent source is dependent on steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions of the jet flow that capture the nozzle and airframe geometry. Contours of the time-averaged streamwise velocity component and turbulent kinetic energy are examined with varying airframe position relative to the nozzle exit. Propagation effects are incorporated by approximating the vector Green’s function of the linearized Euler equations. This approximation involves the use of ray theory and an assumption that broadband shock-associated noise is relatively unaffected by the refraction of the jet shear layer. A nondimensional parameter is proposed that quantifies the changes of the broadband shock-associated noise source with varying jet operating condition and airframe position. Scattered broadband shock-associated noise possesses a second set of broadband lobes that are due to the effect of scattering. Presented predictions from an overexpanded jet demonstrate relatively good agreement compared to a wide variety of measurements.",54,1
