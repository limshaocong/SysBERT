The roll performance of the three-dimensional morphing-wing solution for different design speeds and under structural and strength constraints is analyzed. The design approach uses optimization techniques and considers the three-dimensional aerostructural behavior. The results show the possibility of producing sufficient roll control authority with a morphing solution, thus replacing conventional ailerons up to a design speed of . In a further step, the weight of the system as a function of the produced rolling moment is compared with the one of a conventional system. The obtained relations offer an estimation of the weight penalties associated with morphing. This estimation can be useful in the preliminary design of morphing aircraft.",52,10
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052755,"Indirect noise is analyzed by numerical simulations of the Entropy Wave Generator experiment, which has been set up to study the fundamental mechanism of indirect combustion noise generation. Previous studies of this test case show the major importance of modeling the impedance terminations of the test rig to obtain accurate results. So far, characteristic boundary conditions have been used to model the impedance for numerical calculations. Within this paper, different proposals for setting up the characteristic boundary conditions are reviewed. In addition, a higher accuracy of the impedance model is achieved by applying time-domain impedance boundary conditions. As part of the Entropy Wave Generator experiment, indirect noise is generated by electrical heating wires. It has been found in this study that the modeling of these heat sources is crucial for obtaining accurate results. An advanced heat source model is proposed that is in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Both the advanced impedance and heat source model account for a better agreement between experimental and numerical data than reported in literature to date.",52,10

High-speed shadowgraph movies were simultaneously sampled with dynamic pressure sensors at 75 kHz. From the high-speed shadowgraph movies, observations of the cavity flowfield indicate that linear models like Rossiter’s equation and Helmholtz resonance may be too simplistic to correctly model rectangular cavity flow physics. Some of the observations are as follows. In the cavity’s shear layer, large-scale vortices have been found to be nonperiodic. The shear-layer convection velocity was determined to be at both Mach numbers, which is significantly higher than Rossiter’s equation predicts for correct peak frequency matching. Shear-layer entrainment of freestream flow starts and feeds the acoustic cycle inside the cavity. There are more acoustic wave in the cavity at any one time than has been considered before, which produce the discrete acoustic tones throughout the frequency spectrum.",52,10
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052809,"An acoustic analogy is developed to predict the noise from jet flows. It contains two source models that independently predict the noise from turbulence and shock wave shear layer interactions. The acoustic analogy is based on the Euler equations and separates the sources from propagation. Propagation effects are taken into account by approximating the vector Green’s function of the linearized Euler equations with the use of a locally parallel mean flow assumption. A statistical model of the two-point cross correlation of the velocity fluctuations is used to describe the turbulence. The acoustic analogy attempts to take into account the correct scaling of the sources for a wide range of nozzle pressures and temperature ratios. It does not make assumptions regarding fine- or large-scale turbulent noise sources, self- or shear noise, or convective amplification. The acoustic analogy is partially informed by three-dimensional steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions that include the nozzle geometry. The predictions are compared with experiments of jets operating subsonically through supersonically and at unheated and heated temperatures. Predictions generally capture the scaling of both mixing noise and broadband shock-associated noise for the conditions examined, but some discrepancies remain, which are due to the accuracy of the steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence model closure, the equivalent sources, and the use of a simplified vector Green’s function solver of the linearized Euler equations using a locally parallel mean flow.",52,10
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052810,"An experimental study has been performed to investigate the wake of a three-dimensional turret with aspect ratio of 1.17 at a diameter-based Reynolds number of . Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry was used to evaluate the spatial structure of the wake, and dynamic surface-pressure measurements were used to study the time-dependent behavior. The uncontrolled wake was seen to be strongly three-dimensional with two main structures on opposing sides of the center plane. Cross correlations from the surface pressure indicated that opposite sides of the wake had nearly zero correlation in time. With the application of active flow control, both the spatial structure and time-dependent behavior of the wake were significantly altered. The downwash velocity along the center plane was seen to increase significantly, causing the wake to spread more rapidly near the support plate, and the spectra from the pressure sensors contained multiple peaks at different frequencies throughout the wake that were not seen in the baseline case. Closed-loop control achieved similar control authority as steady open-loop forcing, but with a 45% reduction in the mean jet-momentum coefficient.",52,10
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052818,"Flight experiments carried out with a motorized glider yield insights into the aerodynamic processes acting on a laminar wing section under varying on-coming flow conditions. Measurement data are obtained on a laminar wing glove equipped with pressure transducers and wall microphones to detect transition and investigate the boundary-layer instabilities. The on-coming flow, including the instantaneous angle of attack and the turbulence characteristics, is measured with hot-wire sensors. The flight tests were carried out under calm and moderately turbulent conditions. Characteristic results for both on-coming flow conditions are presented and differences are analyzed. Selected comparisons of the experimental results with steady boundary-layer and linear stability computations are provided. The effects observed in the experiments cannot be described solely by quasi-steady theory. Unsteady changes of the pressure distribution are identified as one source for the modification of the transition development. A conclusion on the observed superimposed effect of increased levels of atmospheric small-scale turbulence on boundary-layer receptivity cannot yet be drawn from the present experiments.",52,10

Uncertainties due to measurements and model parameters are taken into account, and a Bayesian setting supplied with metamodels is used to solve the associated stochastic inverse problem. A sensitivity analysis based on a stochastic spectral framework is first investigated to study the impact of uncertain input data on stagnation-point measurements. An original backward uncertainty propagation method is then proposed, for which only the uncertainties that have the most impact are retained.",52,10
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052834,"The shaped sonic boom theory is a valuable, efficient, computationally economical, and robust tool in preliminary design of low-boom aircraft configurations. Instead of introducing a new F-function parameterization, because it has been investigated already in the past, this paper adopts a more general formulation proposed in the literature and focuses on reducing the limitations of the inverse method in the design process. Three main contributions are proposed: 1) a revisited procedure based on optimization to solve the coefficients of the F function that enables to switch between different parameterizations, 2) a definition of the geometry corresponding to the equivalent area distribution combined with a fuselage tailoring process based on direct shape optimization, and 3) a strategy to introduce a generic acoustic metrics in the definition of an optimum F function. The proposed strategy enables the designer to evaluate the geometry of a low-boom configuration that corresponds to a desired F function in a complete inverse design approach. In this way, the usual limits of the inverse method are significantly alleviated by the present method.",52,10
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052782,"An assessment of the ignition characteristics of several silane/hydrogen combustion models under conditions that are relevant to hypersonic combustion applications is presented. Numerical predictions of silane/hydrogen ignition characteristics are compared to experimental measurements of explosion limits and shock-tube ignition delay times. Furthermore, the ignition properties of silane/hydrogen mixtures are evaluated at conditions extracted from representative streamlines calculated in a computational-fluid-dynamics simulation of a model scramjet configuration tested at the Alliant Techsystems/General Applied Science Laboratory at Mach 10. It is found that the analyzed silane chemical kinetic models are extremely sensitive to temperature and pressure at key combustor conditions. Moreover, the presence of many inconsistencies between experiments and chemical models show that the current knowledge of silane combustion pathways is not sufficient to perform accurate computational-fluid-dynamics simulations of hypersonic combustors. The uncertainties associated with many silane/hydrogen experiments suggest that new accurate measurements at relevant conditions are needed to improve the predictive properties of silane models.",52,10
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052837,"Under the hypotheses of linear potential flow and rigid wake aligned with the freestream, a configuration-invariant analytical formulation for the induced drag minimization of single-wing nonplanar systems is presented. Following a variational approach, the resulting Euler–Lagrange integral equation in the unknown circulation distribution is obtained. The kernel presents a singularity of the first order, and an efficient computational method, ideal for the early conceptual phases of the design, is proposed. Munk’s theorem on the normalwash and its relation with the geometry of the wing under optimal conditions is naturally obtained with the present method. Moreover, Munk’s constant of proportionality, not provided in his original work, is demonstrated to be the ratio between the freestream velocity and the optimal aerodynamic efficiency. The augmented Munk’s minimum induced drag theorem is then formulated. Additional induced drag theorems are demonstrated following the derivations of this invariant procedure. Several nonplanar wing systems are proposed and analyzed, and the optimal induced drag and circulation are provided. The conjecture regarding the equality of the optimum induced drag of a quasi-closed C-wing with the induced drag of the corresponding closed system is also verified for several configurations including the box wing.",52,10
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052851,"A single-bladed AH-1 helicopter rotor blade has been tested to high tip Mach numbers in a hovering acoustically treated test chamber in the presence of vertical gust fields. The vertical gust velocity field has been tailored to closely replicate the impulsive vortex-induced velocity field, thus simulating a single blade–vortex interaction event. The controlled vertical gust disturbance is tailored to simulate the acoustic phasing of parallel, oblique, and a specially designed curved blade–vortex interaction that causes aerodynamic singularities to occur during the interaction process. Far-field acoustic signatures have been measured using a microphone grid in the near in-plane as well as out-of-plane observer regions. Comparisons with theoretical acoustic calculations using computational-fluid-dynamics inputs have yielded good results for the out-of-plane measurement locations, generally validating the use of computational fluid dynamics coupled with linear acoustic theory. At near-in-plane observer regions, comparison with linear acoustic theory calculations showed major discrepancies, indicating that a more in-depth analysis of both the theoretical and experimental approaches is required.",52,10
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052855,"High-aspect-ratio wings present in very flexible aircraft can undergo large deformations, which results in significant changes in natural frequencies as well as in static and dynamic aeroelastic response. This geometric nonlinear behavior becomes an integral part of any aeroelastic analysis to be conducted in such class of vehicles. Aeroelastic scaling is an important way to study the aeroelastic behavior of aircraft, and it is an integral part in risk mitigation for aircraft development. However, the current aeroelastic scaling methodologies have focused on geometrically linear structures. This paper demonstrates a methodology for geometrically nonlinear aeroelastic scaling of very flexible aircraft. The known linear scaling factors and similarity rules are extended to address geometrically nonlinear aeroelastic scaling. A high-aspect-ratio flying wing in free flight is taken as an example to verify the new scaling procedure, and numerical studies are conducted using the University of Michigan’s Nonlinear Aeroelastic Simulation Toolbox. Numerical results support the new approach for aeroelastic scaling of very flexible aircraft.",52,10
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052842,"The laminar-to-turbulent transition of boundary layers induced by isolated three-dimensional roughness elements is analyzed by mining a direct numerical simulation database, which covers the variation of many physical parameters, including Mach and Reynolds numbers, and obstacle shape and size. It is found that the transition process is approximately controlled by a Reynolds number based on the momentum deficit past the obstacle, which is proportional to the classical roughness Reynolds number and which approximately incorporates the effects of the roughness element shape. The analysis of the perturbation energy past the obstacle shows that the varicose mode of instability is always dominant in the close proximity of the obstacle, and it promotes transition in supercritical flow cases. On the other hand, the sinuous mode appears to dominate the evolution of marginally subcritical cases, which feature quasi-steady momentum streaks.",52,10
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052783,"In preparation for wind-tunnel acoustic experiments of a hybrid wing–body vehicle with two jet engine simulator units, a series of twin jet aeroacoustic investigations was conducted leading to increased understanding and risk mitigation. An existing twin jet nozzle system and a fabricated hybrid wing–body aft deck fuselage are combined for a 1.9% model scale study of jet nozzle spacing and jet cant angle effects, elevon deflection into the jet plume, and acoustic shielding by the fuselage body. Linear and phased array microphone measurements are made, and data processing includes the use of the deconvolution approach for the mapping of acoustic sources. Closely spaced twin jets with a 5 deg inward cant angle exhibit reduced noise levels compared with their parallel flow counterparts at similar and larger nozzle spacings. A 40 deg elevon deflection into the twin jet plume, which is required for hybrid wing–body ground rotation, can significantly increase upstream noise levels (more than 5 dB overall sound pressure level) with only minimal increases in the downstream direction. Lastly, deconvolution approach for the mapping of acoustic sources processing can resolve the noise source distribution of multiple shielded jet sources within the limits of the incoherent source assumption.",52,10
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052868,"A new diagnostic method to identify the location and magnitude of external impact on a sandwich structure using granular crystal sensors was studied. The granular crystal sensors are composed of one-dimensional chains of spherical particles that are inserted in a thick core of the sandwich structure. Given an external impact, the embedded sensors generate compact-supported, highly nonlinear solitary waves resulting from the dispersive and nonlinear characteristics of granular crystals. In this study, the propagating mechanism of highly nonlinear solitary waves in relation to various impact conditions was investigated. Particularly, it was reported that the flight time and magnitude of solitary waves are highly sensitive to the location and amplitude of impact. By analyzing measured solitary waves, the striker’s impact location and drop height was successfully predicted nondestructively. It was found that the diagnostic results are in agreement with the numerical simulations obtained from a combined spectral element and discrete element model. The findings in this study imply that the granular crystal sensors can form a new type of impact monitoring system for a sandwich structure to achieve enhanced diagnostic accuracy and potentially to improve sensors’ survivability under harsh mechanical and thermal environments.",52,10
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052843,"Aircraft wings carrying stores are susceptible to nonlinear aeroelastic limit-cycle oscillations, which can lead to reduced flight and mission performance. Limit-cycle-oscillation dynamics and control simulation studies, although of great importance, are often based on simplified typical-section airfoil models. In this work, the more accurate beam–rod representation is used to capture the spanwise varying displacement of a wing with store. The spanwise variation of wing geometry and structural properties, as well as the presence of multiple stores on rigid or flexible mounts, is efficiently modeled by the primitive-modes approach. Aeroelastic limit-cycle oscillation due to structural nonlinearity is demonstrated via time-marching simulations, as well as the computationally more efficient harmonic-balance method. Some novel forms of limit-cycle-oscillation behavior are observed as the model parameters are varied, and these are explained in terms of the flutter/divergence properties of the base linear aeroelastic system.",52,10
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052873,"A delayed detached-eddy simulation of the transonic buffet over a supercritical airfoil is performed. The turbulence modeling approach is based on a one-equation closure, and the results are compared to an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation using the same baseline model as well as experimental data. The delayed detached-eddy simulation successfully predicts the self-sustained unsteady shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction associated with buffet. When separation occurs, the flow exhibits alternate vortex shedding and a spanwise undulation. The method also captures secondary fluctuations in the boundary layer that are not predicted by unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation. A map of flow separation emphasizes the differences between the delayed detached-eddy simulation and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow topologies. Statistical pressure distributions and velocity profiles help assess the performance of each model. They indicate that the delayed detached-eddy simulation tends to overestimate the flow unsteadiness near the trailing edge. Instantaneous distributions of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and large-eddy simulation regions during buffet show that the delayed detached-eddy simulation enforces Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes mode near the airfoil even when the boundary layer gets very thick.",52,10
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052879,"The kriging method has been widely used in design optimization problems not only because it generates an accurate surrogate model but also because it provides a series of criteria to infill points to find the optimal design. With the purpose of improving the accuracy of surrogate models, a dynamic kriging method was proposed to obtain an optimal trend function instead of the fixed trend function in traditional kriging methods. However, the kriging process variance was set to be the objective function with a constant correlation parameter in the optimization problem of selecting the optimal basis functions in the original dynamic kriging method, which proved to be unsuccessful at finding the optimal basis functions. In this paper, a revised dynamic kriging method, including two branches which are different in the objective function of the optimization problem for trend function (named DK-XV1 and DK-XV2, respectively), is proposed to design the trend function using cross-validation. The results of numerical experiments show that DK-XV1 is the promising dynamic kriging method among the original and revised dynamic kriging methods through the comparisons of the root-mean-square error, error correlation coefficient, and consuming time. An engineering example of high-altitude airship conceptual design shows that the DK-XV1 method is effective in constructing accurate surrogate models in surrogate-based optimization.",52,10
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052807,"Systematic asymptotic methods are used to formulate a mathematical model for the response of an inert gas to time-resolved, spatially distributed, thermal energy addition. A primary objective is to identify how thermal energy is converted to kinetic energy to predict the distribution of induced fluid motion and the presence of mechanical disturbances. The gas response to heating is found to depend on two independent parameters, one related to the amount of energy deposited into the volume relative to the initial internal energy present there and the other related to the deposition time scale relative to the characteristic acoustic time in the volume. Results are given for relatively fast (slow), high (low) intensity energy deposition into a wide range of volumes to quantify conditions leading to either near constant volume heating or those leading to near constant pressure processes. In each case, the local expansion Mach number is the fundamental source of mechanical disturbances, via the “piston effect.”",52,10
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052913,"Complex engineering problems are represented by surrogate models in order to find the optimum design points with greater computational efficiency. The least-squares response surface methodology is one of the most commonly used approximation models and has been widely applied to optimization problems in the field of aerospace. In this paper, we propose a new surrogate modeling technique called the sorted -fold approach with which the entire sample points are sorted based on the residuals and then grouped into data sets. Multiple response surfaces are constructed while one data set used for cross-validating the representative response surface is omitted. Each response surface is weighted based on how well it can predict the cross-validating data response. Our investigations reveal that this approach has a higher ability of obtaining accurate predictions than the least-squares response surface methodology when tested at a large number of validation points. When the method is applied to benchmark problems and the numerical simulation of residual stress prediction (done by laser peening in order to improve the fatigue life of aircraft structures), the results maintain validity.",52,10
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053083,"Hover-capable flapping-wing micro air vehicles are well suited for missions in confined spaces. The best design practices for flapping wings and their kinematics are largely unknown, especially for flexible wings. To address this issue, numerical optimization is applied to the design of the kinematics and structural sizing of a flapping wing using a surrogate-based approach. The surrogates are generated using kriging interpolation of the time-averaged thrust generated and power required by the wings. The thrust and power data are computed using a nonlinear approximate aeroelastic model developed in previous studies by the authors. A numerical optimization algorithm is used to identify designs that produce the desired combination of thrust and power. The design variables consist of parameters describing the flap–pitch kinematics and the stiffness of the flexible wings. A trend study of thrust and power indicate that the phase angle between flap and pitch motions significantly affects the wing performance when the stroke amplitudes and the frequency are fixed. Smaller amounts of pitch actuation produced peak thrust in flexible wings when compared to the rigid wings. Several flexible configurations produce higher thrust when compared to the best thrust-producing rigid configuration. However, rigid wings have higher propulsive efficiency when compared to flexible wings for the same amount of generated thrust. Thus, the actual design of a flapping wing will depend on the relative importance given to thrust production and propulsive efficiency.",52,10
