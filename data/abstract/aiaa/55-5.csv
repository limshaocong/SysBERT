After a description of the historical background and initial development of the scheme, the paper discusses three main developments: first, the development of convergence acceleration methods, including residual averaging and multigrid; second, the extension to unstructured grids; and third, the reformulation of the Jameson–Schmidt–Turkel scheme as a total-variation-diminishing scheme and its relationship to symmetric total-variation-diminishing schemes. The paper concludes with a brief review of applications to unsteady and viscous flows.",55,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054709,"The present work reports on the flow physics of turbulent supersonic flow over backward-facing step at Mach 2 using Large-Eddy Simulation methodology where the dynamic Smagorinsky model is used for subgrid-scale modeling, whereas proper orthogonal decomposition is invoked to identify the coherent structures present in the flow. The mean data obtained through the computations are in good agreement with the experimental measurements, whereas the isosurfaces of -criterion at different time instants show the complex flow structures. The presence of counter-rotating vortex pair in the shear layer along with the complex shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction leading to the separation of boundary layer is also evident from the contours of both and the modulus of vorticity. Further, the proper orthogonal decomposition analysis reveals the presence of coherent structures, where the first and second modes confirm the vortical structures near the step as well as along the shear layer in the downstream region, whereas the second, third, and fourth modes confirm the presence of vortices along the shear layer due to Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. Moreover, proper orthogonal decomposition as well as frequency analysis is extended at different planes to extract the detailed flow features.",55,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055164,"The boundary-layer transition on a generic hypersonic forebody at Mach 6 downstream of a sonic wall injection is investigated by means of implicit large-eddy simulation, Fourier analysis, and dynamic mode decomposition of numerical data. An academic Mach 4.2 flat-plate configuration with boundary-layer edge conditions matching those of the forebody is considered. Two empirical correlations are proposed to predict the penetration of the underexpanded tripping jet into the boundary layer (that is, the Mach disk height) as a function of the pressure ratio. Different transition mechanisms are observed downstream of the injection port, depending on the jet penetration. The dynamic mode decomposition reveals the spatial structures, temporal frequencies, and growth rates of three-dimensional instability modes. These modes, arising from the jet counter-rotating vortices, are either varicose or sinusoidal, with the latter being more efficient than the former for tripping the boundary layer at low-injection pressure. Recent experiments in the Boeing/U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research Mach 6 quiet tunnel at Purdue University show similar transition patterns, but also some discrepancies. A more representative configuration including crossflow effects, and more resolved simulations, is needed for a quantitative comparison.",55,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054990,"An unstructured flow solver has been equipped with transition prediction techniques based on different streamline-based approaches, applying the method for the estimation of the points of transition onset. The integration paths for the -factor integration can be approximated using lines parallel to the direction of the oncoming flow for some configurations. If arbitrary three-dimensional geometries are to be computed, the local flow direction can be taken into account. The calculation of the laminar boundary-layer data can either be carried out applying a suitable laminar boundary-layer method or by direct determination from the field solution of the unstructured computational fluid dynamics code. The development and characteristics of the two streamline-based transition prediction techniques, their elements, and properties are described. The focus is put on the latest achievements in the development activities of the two approaches and on their application to various configurations, most of them of industrial relevance. In addition, the specific advantages and shortcomings of the different approaches are discussed. Eventually, a number of challenges for the future development and extension of the transition prediction techniques against the background of a multidisciplinary simulation environment and for the application of computational fluid dynamics solvers to cruise and high-lift aircraft configurations are specified.",55,5

Numerical results on the bubble generation frequency, bubble velocity, volume void fraction, bubble volume, and characteristic bubble lengths are compared with experimental data. Additionally, a new simple fitting for the bubble generation frequency, based upon previously reported experimental works, is proposed here.",55,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054943,"A comprehensive review of aerofoil shape parameterization methods that can be used for aerodynamic shape optimization is presented. Seven parameterization methods are considered for a range of design variables: class–shape transformations; B-splines; Hicks–Henne bump functions; a radial basis function domain element approach; Bèzier surfaces; a singular-value decomposition modal extraction method; and the parameterized sections method. Because of the large range of variables involved, the most effective way to implement each method is first investigated. Their performances are then analyzed by considering the geometric shape recovery of over 2000 aerofoils using a range of design variables, testing the efficiency of design space coverage with respect to a given tolerance. It is shown that, for all the methods, between 20 and 25 design variables are needed to cover the full design space to within a geometric tolerance, with the singular-value decomposition method doing this most efficiently. A set of transonic aerofoil case studies are also presented, with geometric error and convergence of the resulting aerodynamic properties explored. These results show a strong relationship between geometric error and aerodynamic convergence and demonstrate that between 38 and 66 design variables may be needed to ensure aerodynamic convergence to within one drag and one lift count.",55,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055068,"The wake behind a NACA0012 wing at incidence with cut-in sinusoidal trailing edges is experimentally investigated. A wing model with interchangeable trailing edges is used to study their impact on the wake properties. Both vertical and spanwise traverses of hot wires are done at different downstream positions to obtain the downstream evolution of statistical properties and to perform spectral analysis. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry is used to study the flow structure in a spanwise/cross-stream plane. Spanwise inhomogeneity of the velocity deficit and of the wake width is observed and explained by the presence of a spanwise/cross-stream flow induced by the cut-in modifications. Spectral analysis shows a decrease of shedding intensity with a shorter trailing-edge wavelength, with a reduction of up to 57% when compared to a straight blunt wing. Blunt sinusoidal trailing edges exhibit a reduction of spanwise correlation compared to a blunt straight one. A sharp cut-in design is also studied, which exhibits a more broadband shedding spike at a lower frequency.",55,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055500,"A novel approach, which is capable of characterizing different types of ice accretion, was developed by leveraging the significant discrepancies in attenuation characteristics of ultrasonic waves traveling in different ice types (i.e., rime or glaze). While the theories of acoustic attenuation in pulse-echo configuration for a multilayer structure were formulated, a feasibility study was also performed to demonstrate the ultrasonic-attenuation-based technique to characterize two different types of ice samples representative of typical rime and glaze ice accretion seen over airframe surfaces. Significant differences were found in the ultrasonic attenuation characteristics between the two compared ice samples over the frequency range of 5–15 MHz. The attenuation coefficients of the rime-like ice sample were found to be much greater than those of the glaze-like ice sample at any given ultrasonic frequencies. While the values of ultrasonic attenuation coefficients would increase with ultrasonic frequency for both the ice samples, the attenuation coefficients of the rime-like ice were found to have a much greater increasing slope (i.e., ) and wider scattering range than those of the glaze-like ice. Such information could be used to develop ice-type-specific de-icing systems to reduce de-icing operational costs for aircraft operation in cold climate.",55,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055455,"A numerical investigation was carried out to assess the effectiveness of plasma-based flow control for a swept-wing configuration. A single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator was used to delay transition generated by excrescence near the leading edge. Large-eddy simulations were performed for the configuration, which had a wing airfoil section that is representative of modern reconnaissance air vehicles and maintained an appreciable region of laminar flow at design conditions. High-fidelity numerical solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations were generated for wing sweep angles of 30 and 45 deg and compared with the previously obtained unswept case. Control was generally more difficult to attain for nonzero sweep angles and transition could not be delayed for the 45 deg case unless a novel segmented swept actuator configuration was employed. Features of the computed flowfields are elucidated and effects of plasma actuation are quantified. It was found, for a sweep angle of 30 deg, that the wing lift-to-drag ratio could be increased by 9% by applying plasma control, which is comparable to that of the unswept situation. With a sweep angle of 45 deg, although plasma control could delay transition, the lift-to-drag ratio was not favorably altered.",55,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055426,"A novel conception of the plasma Gurney flap is proposed, which consists of two dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators attached to the airfoil pressure surface near the trailing edge. The upstream and downstream plasma actuators can be actuated individually, where it is found that the most significant control effect takes place when only the downstream plasma actuator is turned on. Such optimal conception is applied to a NACA 0012 airfoil and an unmanned aerial vehicle without and with flaps deflection. The present proposed plasma Gurney flap is found to have the similar lift-increment effect and the control mechanism with the conventional Gurney flap. A large-scale counterclockwise recirculation region forms over the airfoil pressure surface near the trailing edge with plasma control, acting as the virtual aeroshaping effect. Consequently, both the suction over the upper surface and the pressure over the lower surface are increased. Thus, the plasma Gurney flap can increase the lift coefficient before the stall angle, reduce the drag coefficient, and increase the lift-to-drag ratio at small angles of attack. In addition, the plasma Gurney flap has additional advantages, such as active control ability and small device drag, making it a very attractive lift-enhancement technique for aeronautical applications.",55,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055260,"The third part of a research program that investigates the possibility of using low-temperature ionized air (plasma) for adaptive optics in an airborne laser directed-energy system is presented. It involves a novel optical measurement method that consists of a dual-wavelength Michelson interferometer that includes a microactuated mirror to allow heterodyne operation. The heterodyne interferometry is an important element in extracting the individual effects of electrons and heavy particles on the optical properties of the plasma. The plasma is generated in a hollow glass cylinder that is sealed at both ends by optical glass. It uses an ac voltage source for which the amplitude is modulated in order to produce sideband phase modulations for heterodyne analysis. A robust demodulation scheme is developed to extract the modulated interferometric phase shifts to reveal the temporal evolution of electron and heavy particle densities within the plasma. The contributions of the electron and heavy particle densities to the plasma optical path difference, which is a measure of optical control, are calculated. Based on an aero-optic standard wavelength, for the conditions examined in the experiment with air, the combined contributions yield an optical path difference of , which is two times larger than nominal optical path difference values in aero-optic applications.",55,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055371,"An oxidation model for carbon surfaces has been developed where the gas–surface reaction mechanisms and corresponding rate parameters are based solely on observations from recent molecular beam experiments. In the experiments, a high-energy molecular beam containing atomic and molecular oxygen (93% atoms and 7% molecules) was directed at a high-temperature carbon surface. The measurements revealed that carbon monoxide (CO) is the dominant reaction product and that its formation required a high surface coverage of oxygen atoms. As the temperature of the carbon sample was increased during the experiment, the surface coverage reduced and the production of CO was diminished. Most importantly, the measured time-of-flight distributions of surface reaction products indicated that CO and carbon dioxide are predominately formed through thermal reaction mechanisms as opposed to direct abstraction mechanisms. These observations have enabled the formulation of a finite-rate oxidation model that includes surface-coverage dependence, similar to existing finite-rate models used in computational fluid dynamics simulations. However, each reaction mechanism and all rate parameters of the new model are determined individually based on the molecular beam data. The new model is compared to existing models using both zero-dimensional gas–surface simulations and computational fluid dynamics simulations of hypersonic flow over an ablating surface. The new model predicts similar overall mass loss rates compared to existing models; however, the individual species production rates are completely different. The most notable difference is that the new model (based on molecular beam data) predicts CO as the oxidation reaction product with virtually no production, whereas existing models predict the exact opposite trend.",55,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055087,"Turbulent boundary layers, which are observed in almost all aerospace vehicles and in natural phenomena, radiate acoustic waves. A closed-form mathematical model is proposed to predict the intensity and coherence of acoustic radiation from turbulent boundary layers. For this purpose, the Navier–Stokes equations are rearranged and solved using a cross-spectral acoustic analogy. Arguments of the model are the spatial two-point cross correlations of the turbulent statistics and mean flow of the turbulent boundary layer. These arguments are modeled using relations whose coefficients are calibrated with numerical and measurement data drawn from a wide range of sources. Models for turbulent statistics are proposed for the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer at a wide range of ambient Mach numbers. Predictions of acoustic intensity, spatial coherence, and model arguments are validated with numerical and measurement data. Predicted sound-pressure levels agree well with numerical results. The variation of the near-field, midfield, and far-field decay of acoustic intensity is investigated. The decay of spatial coherence is demonstrated to be a reflection of the turbulent statistics within the boundary layer. Finally, an analysis of the model equation shows that it is consistent with canonical theory.",55,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055513,"The tonal self-noise emission of a vehicle side mirror and the associated flowfield are investigated experimentally. The relevant surface on the model includes a region of geometry-induced laminar flow separation close to the trailing edge. In the separated shear layer, high-amplitude instability modes at the acoustic mode frequencies are identified. The distinctive pattern of tonal noise emission combined with the shear layer instability modes are characteristic for a self-excited aeroacoustic feedback loop known from investigations of airfoil tonal self-noise emission. The resonance frequencies of the loop are derived from a simplified transfer model and adapted to the present conditions. The existence of the feedback mechanism on the side mirror is finally demonstrated by applying the resonance condition, in which the calculated modes are in very good agreement with the measured modes. Even though the feedback mechanism allows for the coexistence of several modes, a special aspect of the side mirror tonal self-noise emission is that the acoustic modes can alternate in time. The selection of a particular mode is successfully triggered by excitation with an external acoustic disturbance at or near the corresponding mode frequency, which emphasizes the sensitivity of the mode selection toward external disturbances.",55,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055252,"The efficient global optimization approach was often used to reduce the computational cost in the optimization of complex engineering systems. This algorithm can, however, remain expensive for large-scale problems because each simulation uses the full numerical model. A novel optimization approach for such problems is proposed in this paper, in which the numerical model solves partial differential equations involving the resolution of a large system of equations, such as by finite element. This method is based on the combination of the efficient global optimization approach and reduced-basis modeling. The novel idea is to use inexpensive, sufficiently accurate reduced-basis solutions to significantly reduce the number of full system resolutions. Two applications of the proposed surrogate-based optimization approach are presented: an application to the problem of stiffness maximization of laminated plates and an application to the problem of identification of orthotropic elastic constants from full-field displacement measurements based on a tensile test on a plate with a hole. Compared with the crude efficient global optimization algorithm, a significant reduction in computational cost was achieved using the proposed efficient reduced-basis global optimization.",55,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055215,"Substructuring methods have been widely used in structural dynamics to divide large, complicated finite element models into smaller substructures. For linear systems, many methods have been developed to reduce the subcomponents down to a low-order set of equations using a special set of component modes, and these are then assembled to approximate the dynamics of a large-scale model. In this paper, a substructuring approach is developed for coupling geometrically nonlinear structures, where each subcomponent is drastically reduced to a low-order set of nonlinear equations using a truncated set of fixed-interface and characteristic constraint modes. The method used to extract the coefficients of the nonlinear reduced-order model is nonintrusive, in that it does not require any modification to the commercial finite element code but computes the reduced-order model from the results of several nonlinear static analyses. The nonlinear reduced-order models are then assembled to approximate the nonlinear differential equations of the global assembly. The method is demonstrated on the coupling of two geometrically nonlinear plates with simple supports at all edges. The plates are joined at a continuous interface through the rotational degrees of freedom, and the nonlinear normal modes of the assembled equations are computed to validate the models. The proposed substructuring approach reduces a 12,861-degree-of-freedom model down to only 23 degrees of freedom while still accurately reproducing the nonlinear normal modes.",55,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055397,"The current drive for increased efficiency in aeronautic structures such as aircraft, wind-turbine blades, and helicopter blades often leads to weight reduction. A consequence of this tendency can be increased flexibility, which in turn can lead to unfavorable aeroelastic phenomena involving large-amplitude oscillations and nonlinear effects such as geometric hardening and stall flutter. Vibration mitigation is one of the approaches currently under study for avoiding these phenomena. In the present work, passive vibration mitigation is applied to a nonlinear experimental aeroelastic system by means of a linear tuned vibration absorber. The aeroelastic apparatus is a pitch and flap wing that features a continuously hardening restoring torque in pitch and a linear restoring torque in flap. Extensive analysis of the system with and without absorber at precritical and postcritical airspeeds showed an improvement in flutter speed of around 36%, a suppression of a jump due to stall flutter, and a reduction in limit-cycle oscillation amplitude. Mathematical modeling of the experimental system is used to demonstrate that optimal flutter delay is achieved when two of the system modes flutter at the same flight condition. Nevertheless, even this optimal absorber quickly loses effectiveness as it is detuned. The wind-tunnel measurements showed that the tested absorbers were much slower to lose effectiveness than those of the mathematical predictions.",55,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055489,"A numerical model was developed for nonlinear vibro-acoustic analysis of a skin–core debonded sandwich plate immersed in an infinite fluid and subjected to time-varying loads. The structural model of the plate was formulated using a modified variational principle in conjunction with a multilevel partitioning procedure. The nonlinear contact constraints on the detached interfaces of the plate were imposed by using the Nitsche’s method. This led to a stable contact solution that does not depend on the penalty parameter as strongly as in the traditional penalty approach. A time-domain Burton–Miller boundary integral formulation was employed to couple with the structural model of the plate to determine the acoustic field, which avoids spurious instabilities in long-time simulations. Comparisons of the present results were made with solutions obtained from finite element analyses. The results show that both the structural and acoustic responses of a sandwich plate can be significantly affected by the presence of a debonding. For a debonded sandwich plate under harmonic excitation forces, the vibration and acoustic responses of the plate consist of not only the fundamental excitation frequencies, but also subharmonic and superharmonic components and combination harmonics of the excitation frequencies. The effect of the debonding size on the nonlinear vibration and acoustic-radiation responses of sandwich plates was investigated.",55,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055624,"The nonlinear transient behavior of the delaminated composite curved shell panel under different kinds of mechanical loading is investigated in this analysis. The delaminated shell panel model is developed mathematically using two higher-order midplane theories in conjunction with the Green–Langrage type of geometrical nonlinear strains including all the nonlinear higher-order terms. Further, the desired nonlinear responses are computed numerically with the help of a unique computer code developed in the MATLAB® environment. The nonlinear numerical responses are computed using Newmark’s time integration scheme together with the direct iterative method in conjunction with finite-element steps. Further, the convergence behavior of the present numerical results is checked. In addition, the validity of the present numerical responses is shown by comparing the results with those of the available published literature. Finally, the role of the size, location, and position of delamination as well as the effects of different design parameters (curvature ratio, aspect ratio, modular ratio, shell configuration, and constraint condition) on the nonlinear transient responses are computed through a wide variety of numerical examples and discussed in detail.",55,5
