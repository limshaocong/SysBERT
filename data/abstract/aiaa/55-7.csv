In this study, a general-instability-analysis method was used to obtain the upper bounds of the instability growth rates, which are independent of the cutoff parameter in the self-induction integral. This result suggests that, not only do the antisymmetric modes exist, but also they are most amplified. These antisymmetric modes can occur in both the long- and short-wave modes. An example of the growth histories of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes for an aircraft wake is given. It is shown that the presence of the antisymmetric modes can cause the time of linking of the wake vortices to be shortened, which could lead to the reduction of the wake-vortex hazard to following aircraft.",55,7
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055306,"For the flow around a circular cylinder under the synthetic-jet control, a bistable flow has been identified, in which the wake vortex sheds with the symmetric or antisymmetric mode. However, it is difficult to gain insight into the bistable flow due to the complexity with multiple dominant frequencies. Thus, it is aimed to reveal the underlying flow physics of the bistable flow by adopting advanced data-processing techniques. To obtain more accurate dynamic information, total dynamic mode decomposition was employed to extract dynamic modes, spectrum, and mode coefficients to describe the flow dynamics. It was found that the bistable flow contains dual dominant frequencies corresponding to the antisymmetric and symmetric vortex-shedding modes. The mode for the control case approximates to the mode for the natural case, representing the antisymmetric-shedding mode. However, the spatial distributions of the mode are essentially different from those of the mode , representing the symmetric-shedding mode. The influence of the dominant modes and of the control case on the relevant physical components and flow structures was investigated in detail. The mode-competition process was illustrated to help understand the formation mechanism of the bistable flow. In particular, the total-dynamic-mode-decomposition reconstruction approach was adopted to recover the flow structures through superposing the zeroth mode and the different dominant modes. As a result, the individual vortex-shedding mode could be effectively isolated from the bistable flow by the total dynamic mode decomposition.",55,7
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055632,"The interaction of a low-aspect-ratio finite-span pin with a laminar flow over a flat plate was investigated experimentally. The pin was either static or dynamically oscillated in the wall-normal direction at a driving frequency that was either equivalent to the natural shedding frequency or its subharmonic. The mean height of the pin was either equal to 1 or 1.5 times the local boundary-layer thickness. The study focused on the formation and development of two main vortical structures: the arch-type vortex and the horseshoe vortex. It was shown that the arch vortex combined with the counter-rotating horseshoe vortex. The shedding of this coupled phenomenon was investigated under static and dynamic conditions to provide comparisons between their corresponding flowfield behaviors. Under dynamic conditions, the arch-type vortex periodically shed from the pin’s free end and advected downstream, interacting with the horseshoe vortex, which resulted in complex, three-dimensional, and time-periodic flow patterns. The dynamics of these flow structures were determined to be dependent upon the driving frequency and actuation amplitude.",55,7

The experiment was performed in a refractive index matched flow facility to mitigate laser reflections from the hemispherical surface. Data gathered from this experiment represented one of the first applications of plenoptic particle image velocimetry. The ensemble-averaged flow is characterized by a separated shear layer and a symmetric recirculation region. In the instantaneous three-dimensional velocity fields, a separated shear layer and recirculation region, both with asymmetric characteristics, are present. Additionally, arch vortices are found that are detached to the hemispherical surface. The proper orthogonal decomposition was applied to both the three-dimensional velocity and three-dimensional vorticity fields with the goal of identifying the structures created by the hemisphere. The velocity modes showed features associated with the overall flow, whereas the vorticity modes were largely associated with the near wake. The most energetic proper orthogonal decomposition modes showed fluctuations in the boundary layer and recirculation region, as well as suggested the existence of shed arch-shaped vortices.",55,7
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055373,"The numerical investigation of dynamic responses to atmospheric turbulence is an important task during the aircraft design and certification process. Efficient methods are desirable because large parameter spaces spanned by, for example, Mach number, flight altitude, load case, and gust shape need to be covered. Aerodynamic nonlinearities such as shocks and boundary-layer separation should be included to account for transonic flight conditions. A linearized frequency-domain method is outlined to efficiently obtain gust responses using computational fluid dynamics. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are linearized around a steady-state solution and solved for discrete frequencies. The resulting large but sparse system of linear equations can then be evaluated significantly faster than its time-domain counterpart. The method is verified analyzing sinusoidal gust responses for an airfoil and a large civil aircraft considering a broad range of reduced frequencies. Derivatives of aerodynamic coefficients and complex-valued surface pressures are compared for time- and frequency-domain approaches. Next, 1-cos gusts are investigated using an incomplete inverse Fourier transform in conjunction with a complex-valued weighting function to discuss time histories of lift coefficients as well as surface pressures. Finally, introduced techniques are applied to conditions arising from certification requirements to demonstrate the technical readiness. The methods discussed present an important step to establish computational fluid dynamics in the routine aircraft loads process.",55,7

Wall-resolved implicit large-eddy simulations are undertaken on unstructured hexahedral meshes at fourth- and fifth-order accuracy in space. It was found that either modal filtering or antialiasing via an approximate projection is required in order to stabilize simulations. Time-span-averaged pressure coefficient distributions on the aerofoil and associated lift and drag coefficients are seen to converge toward experimental data as the simulation setup is made more realistic by increasing the aerofoil span. Indeed, the lift and drag coefficients obtained by fifth-order implicit large-eddy simulation with antialiasing via an approximate projection agree better with experimental data than a wide range of previous studies. Stabilization via modal filtering, however, is found to reduce solution accuracy. Finally, performance of various PyFR simulations is compared, and it is found that fifth-order simulations with antialiasing via an projection are the most efficient. Results indicate that high-order flux reconstruction schemes with antialiasing via an projection are a good candidate for underpinning accurate wall-resolved implicit large-eddy simulation of separated, turbulent flows over complex engineering geometries.",55,7
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055661,"Large-scale dynamics of high Reynolds industrial rotor/stator cavities is poorly understood today, although it remains critical in determining operating margins for many devices. For space applications, the unsteady pressure phenomena of turbopumps called “pressure bands” depend on geometrical and thermal parameters. Today, such dangerous operating modes are not captured by computational fluid dynamics: the present primary goal is to investigate the ability of large-eddy simulation to accurately reproduce such flows and their sensitivity in terms of large-scale motions and spectral content. After validation of large-eddy simulation based on two geometries and thermalizations, we show that large-eddy simulation reproduces the spectral content overhaul triggered by the change of thermalization. The second objective is a study of the activity recorded in the different cases to improve our understanding of the pressure bands phenomena. To do so, dynamic modal decomposition reveals that the dynamics of the flow is driven by some atomic modes of which the combination explains the oscillatory signals registered by pointwise probes. These modes form macrostructures occupying the interdisk space and are at the origin of the large-scale flow dynamics. Finally, they are observed to significantly differ depending on the configuration, confirming the dependency of pressure bands phenomena on the operating condition and geometrical parameters.",55,7
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055595,"A modeling paradigm is developed to augment predictive models of turbulence by effectively using limited data generated from physical experiments. The key components of the current approach involve inverse modeling to infer the spatial distribution of model discrepancies and machine learning to reconstruct discrepancy information from a large number of inverse problems into corrective model forms. The methodology is applied to turbulent flows over airfoils involving flow separation. Model augmentations are developed for the Spalart–Allmaras model using adjoint-based full-field inference on experimentally measured lift coefficient data. When these model forms are reconstructed using neural networks and embedded within a standard solver, it is shown that much improved predictions in lift can be obtained for geometries and flow conditions that were not used to train the model. The neural-network-augmented Spalart–Allmaras model also predicts surface pressures extremely well. Portability of this approach is demonstrated by confirming that predictive improvements are preserved when the augmentation is embedded in a different commercial, finite element solver. The broader vision is that, by incorporating data that can reveal the form of the innate model discrepancy, the applicability of data-driven turbulence models can be extended to more general flows.",55,7

The vortex generator configurations studied include the Ashill, Anderson, split-Anderson, trapezoidal, and ramp–vane designs. Each device height spanned 30% of the local boundary-layer thickness estimated just upstream of the separation for no control. An array of each control device configuration was implemented upstream of the separation location for no control. Additionally, one ramp–vane device with was also tested. Out of all the configurations tested, the ramp–vane device shows the maximum downstream shift (21%) in separation location. This device and the split-Anderson configuration both show a reduction in the maximum rms values by 26 and 24%, respectively. The study on ramp–vane devices (, 0.5) further shows that the size of the split relative to the device height also seems to be an important parameter. For the ramp–vane devices (, 0.5), a smaller intervane spacing of instead of shows a very effective control. From this perspective, providing a split size of in split-Anderson device has also shown favorable results.",55,7
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055578,"This paper reports on an experimental investigation of the flowfield and acoustic behavior of an innovative quadruple synthetic jet device operated in different configurations. The device consists of four resonant cavities, each driven separately by a loudspeaker in such a way that it is possible to implement any configuration in terms of the frequency, amplitude, and initial phase angle of the exit velocities of the four embedded jets. Here, the main goal is to investigate the effect of varying the phase delay between the ejection strokes of the single synthetic jets. At first, a calibration procedure of the driving signals is designed in order to ensure that the four jets have the same exit conditions, except for a desired phase shift. Second, four different configurations are investigated at fixed values of the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers of each synthetic jet, equal to 4000 and 0.2, respectively. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements highlight the central role of the near-field large-scale coherent vortex structures in determining the flow behavior. Far-field noise measurements show that, by introducing a phase shift between the jet exit velocities, a significant noise reduction can be obtained (up to 23.9% for the examined configurations).",55,7

Microdischarges generate high-amplitude, high-frequency current spike transients superimposed on a low-amplitude, low-frequency current. A high-speed digital oscilloscope was used to measure the actuator power consumption using the shunt resistor method and the monitor capacitor method. The measurements were performed simultaneously and compared to each other in a time-accurate manner. It was found that low signal-to-noise ratios of the oscilloscopes used, in combination with the high dynamic range of the current spikes, make the shunt resistor method inaccurate. An innovative, nonlinear signal compression circuit was applied to the actuator current signal and yielded excellent agreement between the two methods. The paper describes the issues and challenges associated with performing accurate power measurements. It provides insights into the two methods including new insight into the Lissajous curve of the monitor capacitor method. Extension to a broad range of parameters and further development of the compression hardware will be performed in future work.",55,7
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055224,"An aircraft wake vortex retrieval method that estimates the horizontal and vertical positions and radii-averaged circulations of wake vortices from lidar-measured Doppler spectra on a lateral range–height indicator is proposed. The method formulates relationships between state variables and measured Doppler spectra for each individual wake vortex and iteratively optimizes the state variables so as to match the measured Doppler spectra. Because the state variables consist of a position, the parameters of an assumed two-dimensional vortex model, and a local background wind, high retrieval accuracy is achieved without adverse influences from errors in the preestimation of position or background wind. The separate formulation of each wake vortex enables the method to flexibly handle nonideal cases, for example where only one wake vortex of a pair remains or a long-persistent wake vortex and a newly generated pair of wake vortices coexist on a single range–height indicator. The retrieval results were evaluated against reference flight data from 864 flights collected during a wake vortex observation campaign conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency at Narita International airport. The evaluation was performed by an approach using self- and cross-evaluation models, which allowed the evaluation of a large number of retrievals considering time variation of the wake vortex parameters. As a result, the proposed method was found to retrieve horizontal position with a bias error of and a standard error of 4.8 m; vertical position with bias and standard errors of and 3.5 m, respectively; and radii-averaged circulation with bias and standard errors of and , respectively.",55,7
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055444,"This article considers the problem of estimating dynamic derivatives of a basic finned projectile using computational fluid dynamic simulations. The indicial responses with respect to a unit step change in the effective angle of attack and pitch rate are calculated using a grid motion approach. The applications of these responses are then twofold: 1) they can be directly used to predict unsteady aerodynamic responses using a convolution integral; and 2) in addition, the indicial responses are used to calculate acceleration and rotary derivatives of the vehicle at different Mach numbers. These predictions are compared with available experimental data of the U.S. Army–Navy basic finner and those estimated from traditional oscillatory simulations. The results show that static and dynamic derivative numerical predictions match well with the experimental data over a wide range of Mach numbers. The outcome of this study is a demonstration of the ability of indicial response function methods to predict longitudinal dynamic derivatives, both for isolated input variables as well as combined values. The results reveal an ability to represent greater details of the flow features in the output derivatives compared to more traditional techniques. These benefits are in addition to the computational cost savings of using indicial methods to estimate dynamic derivatives rather than the use of traditional methods based on harmonic motions.",55,7
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054816,"Numerical simulations were performed to investigate the flowfield around a flexible flapping-wing micro air vehicle using an in-house-developed computational fluid dynamics solver. To include the dynamics of the flexible wings and its impact on the aerodynamic behavior of the micro air vehicle, the wing-deformation pattern during flapping was experimentally determined by a stereovision measurement. These data were subsequently interpolated to be employed as prescribed flapping kinematics in the numerical flow simulations, using a computational fluid dynamics solver that is based on a deformable overset-grid method. The computational results of the hovering configuration provide a quantitative prediction of the unsteady aerodynamics of the flapping-wing micro air vehicle in terms of aerodynamic-force production and flow structures. The formation and evolution of the leading-/trailing-edge vortex and tip vortex were visualized. Additionally, by introducing an incoming freestream flow velocity in the simulations, the flow structure related to the forward-flight configuration is investigated. The forces and the flow structures are compared with the experimental results from force and digital-particle-image-velocimetry measurements; a good agreement was illustrated that further evidenced the capability of the numerical methodology proposed in the present study.",55,7
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055328,"This paper focuses on the spurious noise of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation with a permeable integral surface, which is now commonly used in far-field noise prediction for computational aeroacoustics methodologies. Spurious noise arises in the surface integral terms as an adverse effect of truncating a computational domain resolved for the quadrupole sources so that hydrodynamic fluctuations pass through the integral surface with mean flow. First, the quadrupole contribution is reformulated in the form of surface integrals for additive correction by introducing a frozen turbulence assumption for uniform mean flow. The math formulation is verified for simple convecting vortices. The derived formulation is then extended to nonuniform convection for locally subsonic flow. By adding the correction to the conventional Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings surface integrals, spurious noise is suppressed in two-dimensional wake flow. In a three-dimensional turbulent jet-noise simulation, the proposed correction, extended to nonuniform convection, is demonstrated to reduce the dependence of the prediction on the streamwise end-cap location of the integral surface. The present method requires no tunable parameters, with only a minimal additional cost compared to the conventional permeable-surface integrals in the far-field noise computation.",55,7
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055606,"The noise spectrum of screeching jets consists of broadband and discrete components referred to as turbulent mixing noise and screech tones, respectively. The screech tones make the application of classical noise models to screeching jets difficult for modern problems. These problems involve an additional treatment of the near-field dynamics before the broadband noise prediction schemes can be implemented. This paper proposes an a posteriori approach for studying the velocity fluctuations associated with the broadband turbulent mixing noise in screeching jets. The broadband and screeching fluctuations associated with the broadband and discrete noise components are calculated using proper orthogonal decomposition to decouple the velocity variables. The methodology is demonstrated on velocity fields of screeching jets measured with high-resolution particle image velocimetry. Jets dominated by the precessing flapping (B) and helical (C) instability screech modes are considered, which correspond to ideally expanded Mach numbers of , 1.45, and 1.59, respectively. Axially averaged spatial wavelength spectra of the broadband velocity fluctuations are compared to illustrate the decomposition. The proper-orthogonal-decomposition-based approach is shown to be highly dependent upon the dominant instability regime of the jets. Further analysis shows that the integral length scales of the broadband velocity fluctuations normalized by the incompressible momentum thickness in the screeching jets considered agree well with values reported in studies on nonscreeching jets despite the absolute values differing.",55,7

It is assumed that kinetic fluctuations manifest themselves in the governing equations through “stochastic forcing” by a random stress tensor and by a random heat flux. The stochastic forcing generates unstable modes in boundary layers. By solving the kinetic-fluctuation receptivity problem, the root-mean-square amplitudes of instability are expressed in terms of correlations for the random stress tensor and heat flux stemming from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The results indicate that the boundary-layer flow is most susceptible to kinetic fluctuations in the critical layer, and the receptivity occurs near the lower branch of the neutral stability curve for the considered instability. Although the initial amplitudes of the unstable modes generated by kinetic fluctuations are small, they go through a significant amplification toward the nonlinear region and may lead to laminar-turbulent transition. The root-mean-square amplitudes of kinetic-fluctuation-induced instability are expressed in a compact analytical form, which does not contain any empirical quantities. This opens up an opportunity to estimate the upper bound of the transition Reynolds number in the framework of a physics-based amplitude method. The results are consistent with the previous theoretical findings indicating that kinetic fluctuations at a microscopic scale can trigger a macroscopic phenomenon: laminar-turbulent transition in boundary-layer flows.",55,7

The number of thermal degrees of freedom is first reduced by projecting the thermal state of a sample structure into a modal space whose bases are determined using proper orthogonal decomposition. A numerical integration scheme based on the Crank–Nicolson algorithm is used to simulate the thermal state forward in time. Models for the generalized material thermal properties are based on the method of kriging, a least-squares polynomial approximation, and a singular value decomposition approach. The resulting thermal models are compared in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. The singular value decomposition approach is shown to be the superior overall reduced-order model to capture the variation of thermal properties with temperature when compared to a full-order finite element solution. The effects of varying the number of retained thermal modes and thermal property eigenvectors on the singular value decomposition model are then considered. It is shown that only a few eigenvectors need to be considered to achieve excellent agreement with finite element analysis.",55,7

The calculations deal with choked, unchoked, as well as compact and noncompact nozzles. In the choked case, a normal shock exists in the divergent section of the nozzle. First, for circumferential waves and for a compact choked nozzle, it is shown that the pressure, entropy, and vorticity perturbations at the nozzle outlet can be obtained directly from the perturbations at the nozzle inlet. Thus, for the choked case, there is no need to model either the linear waves or the mean flow within the nozzle. Then, to validate the models developed, cylindrical configurations corresponding to the so-called Entropy Wave Generator and Hot Acoustic Testrig are studied. For the Entropy Wave Generator, an entropy wave is generated upstream of a nozzle by an electrical heating device, and for the Hot Acoustic Testrig, a speaker is used to generate pressure waves. In these two configurations and for the choked case, the supersonic region between the nozzle throat and the normal shock is assumed to be acoustically compact. The results of the low-order model are found to give excellent agreement with the experimental results of the Entropy Wave Generator and Hot Acoustic Testrig. To give insight into the physics, the model is used to undertake a parametric study for a range of nozzle lengths and shock strengths. The low-order model is finally used to calculate the direct to indirect (entropy and vorticity) combustion noise ratio for an idealized thin annular combustor. For this model combustor, the direct acoustic noise is found to dominate within the combustor, whereas the entropy indirect noise is found to be the main source of noise downstream of the choked nozzle. The indirect vorticity noise has a negligible contribution.",55,7

To measure the scramjet inlet air mass flow rate, air data parameters are estimated. The inertial-navigation-system-computed air data are real time but not accurate enough. The flush air data sensing system can provide sufficiently accurate estimations of air data parameters, but it is not employed during the flight. This paper proposes a predictor–corrector method. Accurate air data estimations are not required. The scramjet inlet air mass flow rate estimated by the inertial-navigation-system-computed air data is taken as the prediction value. Surface pressure measurements combined with the inertial navigation system provide the correction value. The algorithm is simple enough and can be implemented in real time. Comparing the results of the scramjet inlet air mass flow rate estimated by the inertial navigation system and predictor–corrector method, it is shown that the predictor–corrector method can greatly improve the accuracy of the scramjet inlet air mass flow rate measurement.

The aim of this work is to investigate the capabilities of modern computational methods for these types of complex flows, to study the unsteady characteristics of the flowfield, and to explore the use of proper orthogonal decomposition methods to understand the nature of the unsteady flow distortion. The unsteady flows for a range of S-duct configurations have been simulated using a delayed detached-eddy simulation method. Analysis of the conventional distortion criteria highlights the main sensitivities to the S-duct configuration and quantifies the unsteady range of these parameters. The unsteady flowfield shows signature regions of unsteadiness, which are postulated to be related to the classical secondary flows as well as to the streamwise flow separation. A proper orthogonal decomposition of the total pressure field at the duct exit identifies the underpinning flow modes, which are associated with the overall total pressure unsteadiness distributions. Overall, the unsteady distortion metrics are not found to be solely linked to a particular proper orthogonal decomposition mode, but are dependent on a wider range of modes.",55,7

As implemented here, the evolution-variable manifold approach solves a scalar conservation equation for a reaction-evolution variable that represents both the induction and subsequent oxidation phases of combustion. The detailed thermochemical state of the reacting fluid is tabulated as a low-dimensional manifold as a function of density, energy, mixture fraction, and the evolution variable. A numerical flux function consistent with local thermodynamic processes is developed, and the approach for coupling the computational fluid dynamics to the evolution-variable manifold table is discussed. Wall-modeled large-eddy simulations incorporating the evolution-variable manifold framework are found to be in good agreement with full chemical kinetics model simulations and the jet in supersonic crossflow hydrogen–air experiments of Gamba and Mungal (“Ignition, Flame Structure and Near-Wall Burning in Transverse Hydrogen Jets in Supersonic Crossflow,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 780, Oct. 2015, pp. 226–273).

Assisted by abundant cheap low-fidelity data, it can greatly improve the metamodeling efficiency by using relatively fewer expensive high-fidelity samples when compared with commonly used one-fidelity metamodeling methods. In this paper, a radial-basis-function-based multifidelity metamodeling method is proposed to approximate expensive black-box problems. This method has the following features: 1) it can be explicitly expressed almost in the simplest way; 2) it can be easily implemented through one-time matrix computation; and 3) it can be used to approximate black-box problems by samples with more than two fidelities. Besides, an adaptive sequential sampling method based on Voronoi partition and cross-validation is also developed to further improve the multifidelity metamodeling efficiency. To validate the proposed method, it is tested by several numerical benchmark problems and successfully applied in the optimal design of the drive axle in an all-direction propeller. Moreover, an overall comparison between the radial-basis-function-based multifidelity metamodeling method and several other metamodeling methods has been made.

System identification is employed to build reduced-order models for the aerodynamic forces from a full Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver, which are then coupled with the structural solver to obtain the full aeroelastic solution. The resulting approximation is extremely cheap. Two time-domain reduced-order models are considered: autoregressive with exogenous inputs, and a linear-parameter-varying–autoregressive-with-exogenous-input model. Standard aeroelastic test cases of a two-degree-of-freedom airfoil and Goland wing are studied, employing the reduced-order models. After evaluating the accuracy of the reduced-order models, they are used to quantify uncertainty in the stability characteristics of the system due to uncertainty in the structure. This is observed to be very large for moderate structural uncertainty. Finally, the uncertainty is reduced using simulated aeroelastic response data from flight tests to update structural parameters using the Bayes’ theorem.",55,7

By inspecting the eigenvalues, the stability of the system is examined for variations in different parameters. The obtained results are validated through comparison against those reported in the literature. Furthermore, the effects of offset of the aerodynamic center from the reference axis, the precone angle, the lead–lag frequency, static stall, and the drag coefficient on the stability boundaries of the system are evaluated.

26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055833,"This work investigates experimentally and computationally the uniaxial ratcheting strain and plastic shakedown of aluminum alloy 7075-T6. The experimental results illustrate the existence of both plastic shakedown and cyclic hardening, proving that both kinematic and isotropic hardening should be included in modeling. Although the multicomponent Armstrong–Frederick model with multiplier has demonstrated high accuracy in aluminum ratcheting simulation, as well implementation ease, the present results demonstrate poor performance when plastic shakedown is considered. This is attributed to the limited flexibility in varying the model parameters to balance the loading/unloading branches in the hysteresis loops and decelerate ratcheting pace. To improve the ability of the multicomponent Armstrong–Frederick model with multiplier in simulating plastic shakedown, a modification was made within the framework of the model that includes multiple backstress components, with each obeying its own kinematic hardening. A linear kinematic hardening backstress was added in the formulation, enabling the control of ratcheting pace and the occurrence of plastic shakedown. Simulations with the modified multicomponent Armstrong–Frederick model with multiplier demonstrate a significantly improved capability for ratcheting and plastic shakedown. Moreover, the modified multicomponent Armstrong–Frederick model with multiplier improved the life prediction for an actual aerospace structure. This provides a strong indication of the importance of achieving plastic shakedown accuracy when simulating cyclic elastoplastic behavior.",55,7
