0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054212,"Large-eddy simulations of a wing-body junction flow experimentally studied are presented. Wall junction flows are common in engineering applications, but the flow physics at the corners of the junction is not well understood. Moreover, in these types of flows, the performance of the subgrid-scale models frequently used for large-eddy simulations is not well characterized. To address these issues, large-eddy simulations of the wing–body junction are performed, with multiple levels of grid resolution. Two-dimensional turbulent profiles are generated every time step and introduced to the inlet plane of the computation domain to mimic the unsteady turbulent boundary layer. A Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculation is used as a precursor to initialize the flowfield of the large-eddy simulations. Then, large-eddy simulations with the Vreman model is performed and the simulation results are analyzed with respect to three specific goals: compare the computed and measured turbulence statistics in the junction region, investigate the flow physics in the corner region, and discuss the potential reasons for the inaccuracies of the subgrid-scale model. The sensitivity of the predicted results to inflow conditions and to subgrid-scale modeling is also investigated.",54,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054043,"Boundary-layer receptivity to acoustic disturbances plays a key role in transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Acoustic disturbances interact with strong streamwise gradients at the leading edge to create Tollmien–Schlichting waves in the boundary layer. Measurement of Tollmien–Schlichting receptivity to downstream-traveling sound is complicated by the presence of Stokes waves in the boundary layer and upstream-traveling acoustic reflections that also generate downstream-traveling Tollmien–Schlichting waves. Active noise control is used to cancel reflections and enables the measurement of boundary-layer receptivity to downstream-traveling sound. Tollmien–Schlichting wave amplitudes are extracted from hot-wire data using biorthogonal decomposition of modified Orr–Sommerfeld equations that include acoustic disturbance solutions. The new method is implemented to measure the acoustic receptivity of a 20:1 modified superellipse leading edge on a flat plate. The data yield acoustic receptivity coefficients consistent with the results of previous computational studies. For comparison, pulsed-sound measurements are also obtained, which are comparable to both biorthogonal decomposition and direct numerical simulation results. The new measurement technique provides for efficient decomposition of measurements and sets the stage for renewed experimental effort in this area.",54,3

Three-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved using the modified weighted compact nonlinear scheme. Similar to previous studies, the acoustic fields indicate that there are at least three types of acoustic waves in all of the cases considered herein: 1) Mach waves generated from the shear layer of the main jet, 2) acoustic waves generated from the impingement region, and 3) Mach waves generated from the shear layer of the supersonic flow downstream of the jet impingement. Acoustic waves (2) are generated from two different acoustic sources: 1) the interaction between the plate shock wave and the shear layer, and 2) the interaction between the bubble-induced shock waves and the shear layer. The frequency characteristics of acoustic waves are related to the thickness of the shear layer in the impingement region. The results of the present study indicate the source location and the characteristics of acoustic waves (2) for various flat-plate angles.",54,3

SU2 is a computational analysis and design package that has been developed to solve multiphysics analysis and optimization tasks using unstructured mesh topologies. Its unique architecture is well suited for extensibility to treat partial-differential-equation-based problems not initially envisioned. The common framework adopted enables the rapid implementation of new physics packages that can be tightly coupled to form a powerful ensemble of analysis tools to address complex problems facing many engineering communities. The framework is demonstrated on a number, solving both the flow and adjoint systems of equations to provide a high-fidelity predictive capability and sensitivity information that can be used for optimal shape design using a gradient-based framework, goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement, or uncertainty quantification.",54,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054076,"The paper presents the developments of novel mesh generation algorithms over complex glaze-ice shapes containing multicurvature ice-accretion geometries, such as single/double ice horns. The twofold approaches tackle surface geometry discretization as well as field mesh generation. First, an adaptive curvilinear curvature control algorithm is constructed, solving a one-dimensional elliptic partial differential equation with periodic source terms. This method controls the arc length grid spacing, so that high convex and concave curvature regions around ice horns are appropriately captured, and is shown to effectively treat the grid shock problem. Second, a novel blended method is developed by defining combinations of source terms with two-dimensional elliptic equations. The source terms include two common control functions, Sorenson and Spekreijse, and an additional third source term to improve orthogonality. This blended method is shown to be very effective for improving grid quality metrics for complex glaze-ice meshes with Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes resolution. The performance in terms of residual reduction per nonlinear iteration of several solution algorithms (point–Jacobi, Gauss–Seidel, alternating direction implicit, point, and line Successive Over-Relaxation) are discussed within the context of a full multigrid operator. Details are given on the various formulations used in the linearization process. It is shown that this performance of the solution algorithm depends on the type of control function used. Finally, the algorithms are validated on standard complex experimental ice shapes, demonstrating the applicability of the methods.",54,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054282,"This work presents multiple high-fidelity large-eddy simulations of flow over a cylindrical turret with a flat window oriented at two angles, 90 and 100 deg. For the 100 deg case, additional computations were performed to investigate the effectiveness of multiple types of flow control including rows of short pins, tall pins, and steady blowing wall jets inserted upstream of the turret as well as a steady suction slot at the leading edge of the flat window. The large-eddy simulation computations were obtained using a well-validated high-order Navier–Stokes flow solver employing a sixth-order compact spatial discretization in conjunction with an eighth-order low-pass spatial filter. Overall, large-eddy simulation solutions compared favorably to experimental time mean and fluctuating velocity profiles as well as the general flow structure at both angles. Additionally, valuable insight was obtained on how rows of pins, blowing jets, and steady slot suction control flow separation. Slot suction at the upwind aperture lip was determined to be more effective than rows of pins and blowing jets in controlling flow separation, which is critical in reducing aero-optical aberrations. Steady slot suction was capable of eliminating massive separation at a larger look angle of 120 deg.",54,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054495,"The flow structure over a 35 deg swept delta wing is characterized in a low-speed wind tunnel using techniques of laser-illuminated smoke visualization, laser Doppler anemometry, and surface-pressure measurements. The effects of Reynolds numbers and attack angles on the evaluation of flow patterns are addressed within the broad range of Reynolds number and attack angle . In addition, the effect of steady blowing through the leading edges of the wing on flow structure is studied to delay three-dimensional surface separation. A comparison of two different blowing patterns, uniform blowing and decreasing blowing, is used to identify the effective regions on leading edges considering the ultimate influence of flow control. The results indicate that the effect of Reynolds number on flow structure is limited, such that beyond a certain Reynolds number, the flow structure demonstrates minimal variations with further increase in Reynolds number. Considering the results of the flow-control study, steady blowing through leading edge significantly alters the flow structure, and is quite effective in the eradication of three-dimensional surface separation. The decreasing-blowing pattern compared to uniform blowing seems to be more efficient on the overall flow structure, indicating that control through leading edge near the apex region is more effective.",54,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054624,"As demonstrated by Parent, B., et al., ( “ Electron and Ion Transport Equations in Computational Weakly-Ionized Plasmadynamics ,” Journal of Computational Physics , Vol.  54 , 2014 , pp.  51 – 69 ), the computational efficiency of the drift-diffusion plasma model can be increased significantly by recasting the equations such that the potential is obtained from Ohm’s law rather than Gauss’s law and by adding source terms to the ion transport equations to ensure that Gauss’s law is satisfied. Not only did doing so reduce the stiffness of the system, leading to faster convergence, but it also resulted in a higher resolution of the converged solution. The combined gains in convergence acceleration and resolution amounted to a hundredfold increase in computational efficiency when simulating nonneutral plasmas with significant quasi-neutral regions. In this paper, it is shown that such a recast of the drift-diffusion model has yet another advantage: its lack of stiffness permits the electron and ion transport equations to be integrated in coupled form along with the Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Test cases relevant to plasma aerodynamics (including nonneutral sheaths, magnetic field effects, and negative ions) demonstrate that the proposed coupled system of equations can be converged in essentially the same number of iterations as that describing nonionized flows while not sacrificing the generality of the drift-diffusion model.",54,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054452,"Tubercles are modifications to the leading edge of an airfoil in the form of blunt wave-like serrations. Several studies on the effect of tubercles on isolated airfoils have shown a beneficial effect in the poststall regime as reduced drag and increased lift, leading to a delay of stall. The prospect of delaying stall is particularly attractive to designers of axial compressors in gas turbines, because this leads to designs with higher loading and therefore higher pressure rise with fewer number of stages. In the present study, experiments were performed on a cascade of airfoils with a NACA 65209 profile with different tubercle geometries. The measurements were made over an exit plane using a five-hole probe to compare the cascade performance parameters. Additionally, hot-wire measurements were taken near the blade surface to understand the nature of the flow in the region close to the tubercles. Oil-flow visualization on the cascade end wall reveals the flow through the passage of blades with and without tubercles. For the cascade considered, the estimated stall angle for the best performing set of blades is found to increase up to 8.6 deg from that of the unmodified blade of 6.0 deg. Application of such structures in axial compressor blades may well lead to suppression of stall in axial compressors and extend the operating range.",54,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052979,"This paper describes the systematic experimental and computational studies performed to investigate the performance of a small-scale vertical-axis wind turbine using dynamic blade pitching. A vertical-axis wind turbine prototype with a simplified blade pitch mechanism was designed, built, and tested in the wind tunnel to understand the role of pitch kinematics in turbine aerodynamic efficiency. A computational fluid dynamics model was developed, and the model predictions correlated well with test data. Both experimental and computational fluid dynamics studies showed that the turbine efficiency is a strong function of blade pitching amplitude, with the highest efficiency occurring around to amplitude. The optimum tip-speed ratio depends on the blade pitch kinematics, and it decreases with increasing pitch amplitude for the symmetric blade pitching case. A computational fluid dynamics analysis showed that the blade extracted all the power in the frontal half of the circular trajectory; however, it lost power into the flow in the rear half: one key reason for this being the large virtual camber and incidence induced by the flow curvature effects, which slightly enhanced the power extraction in the frontal half but increased the power loss in the rear half. The maximum achievable of the turbine increased with higher Reynolds numbers; however, the fundamental flow physics remained relatively the same, irrespective of the operating Reynolds number. This study clearly indicates the potential for major improvements in vertical-axis wind turbine performance with novel blade kinematics, a lower chord/radius ratio, and using cambered blades.",54,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054571,"An airbreathing pulse detonation engine-crossover system is developed to characterize the feasibility of shock-initiated combustion within an airbreathing pulse detonation engine. A shock wave is transferred through a crossover tube that connects a spark-ignited driver pulse detonation engine to the airbreathing, driven pulse detonation engine. Detonations in the driven pulse detonation engine develop from shock-initiated combustion caused by shock wave reflection. The pulse detonation engine-crossover system increases system efficiency through decreased deflagration-to-detonation transition distance while employing a single spark source to initiate a system consisting of multiple detonation tubes. The initiation effectiveness of shock-initiated combustion is compared to spark discharge initiation and detonation injection through a predetonator. Increasing the Reynolds number enhances combustion wave acceleration. However, for all initiation methods, the system requires a device to transition the combustion wave to a detonation. Shock-initiated combustion and predetonator initiation produce comparable detonation transition runup lengths. With an incident shock wave Mach number of , the runup length is decreased by up to 61% compared to the spark discharge method. Similar combustion evolution is observed for an incident shock wave of strength .",54,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054294,"The Turbomeca gas turbine model combustor was studied to understand the effect of increased thermal power density on the structure and dynamics of premixed swirl flames. The burner was operated under two flame conditions: one stable, and one with self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations. Simultaneous measurements of scalar and three-component velocity fields were acquired at 3 and 6 kHz frequencies. Nonreacting flow measurements were used to approximate the spatial and temporal resolution with respect to the scales of the incoming flow. Time-resolved velocimetry revealed the presence of periodic fluctuations in both flames, occurring at shifted frequencies that did not correspond to a resonant acoustic mode or any corresponding harmonics. Proper orthogonal decomposition analysis revealed stably forced inner shear-layer oscillations that periodically formed and ejected symmetric vortex pairs under stable flame operation. The unstable flame was found to exhibit a single spatiotemporally evolving flow structure consistent with a helical precessing vortex core. A reconstructed time series elucidated the interactions of the reactant jets, the precessing vortex core, and the central recirculation bubble over a thermoacoustic cycle. This coupled interaction, and the resultant modulation of transport within the inner shear layer, were identified as a mechanism by which the precessing vortex core was linked to elevated power density flame dynamics.",54,3

As in that work, the analysis is carried out under linear-inviscid assumptions for the perturbation field, with streamwise changes of the base flow neglected, as is appropriate given the slenderness of the mixing-layer flow. The steady-disturbance profile is determined by taking a Fourier transform along the longitudinal coordinate. Closed-form analytical functions for the pressure field are derived in the small- and large-wave-number limits, and vorticity disturbances are obtained as functions of the pressure perturbations. The analysis is particularized to ethylene–air and hydrogen–air mixing layers, for which the dynamics are of current interest for hypersonic propulsion. The results provide, in particular, the effective distance of upstream influence of the pressure perturbation in the subsonic stream. The resulting value, which scales with the thickness of the subsonic layer, is much smaller than the upstream influence distances encountered in boundary layers. This study may serve as a basis to understand shock-induced autoignition and flameholding phenomena in simplified versions of non-premixed supersonic-combustion problems.",54,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054404,"There has been little research into surface-ablation effects on hypersonic boundary-layer instability, and the current understanding of real-gas effects on hypersonic boundary-layer instability still contains uncertainties. The objective of the current work was to analyze the hypersonic boundary-layer transition process using linear-stability theory, in which surface ablation, as well as real-gas effects, is present, and the second mode is the dominant instability mode. A thermochemical nonequilibrium linear-stability-theory code with a gas-phase model that includes multiple carbon species, as well as a linearized surface graphite-pseudoablation model, is developed and validated. It is validated with previously published linear-stability analysis and direct-numerical-simulation results. A high-order method for discretizing the linear-stability equations is used, which can easily include high-order boundary conditions. The developed linear-stability code, with mean-flow solutions produced from a high-order shock-fitting direct-numerical-simulation method for hypersonic flows with thermochemical nonequilibrium and surface-chemistry boundary conditions for graphite pseudoablation, is used to study hypersonic boundary-layer instability for a 7 deg half-angle blunt cone at Mach 15.99 and the Reentry-F experiment at 100 kft. Multiple mean-flow simulations are obtained with the same geometry and freestream conditions to help separate real-gas, blowing, and carbon-species effects on hypersonic boundary-layer instability. For the case at Mach 15.99, an factor comparison shows that real-gas effects significantly destabilize the flow when compared to an ideal gas. Blowing is destabilizing for the real-gas simulation, and has a negligible effect for the ideal-gas simulation due to the different locations of instability onset. Notably, carbon species resulting from ablation are shown to slightly stabilize the flow for both cases. It is also found that ablating nose-cone effects may safely be excluded when determining the factor at transition for Reentry-F at 100 kft.",54,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054562,"Molecular simulations with a resolved surface microstructure were performed for high-temperature dissociated oxygen reacting with a carbon–carbon composite material. The direct simulation Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the convection and diffusion of reactants toward the microstructure and the transport of surface reaction products away from the microstructure. Simulations were performed with and without gas-phase chemical reactions to determine the relative importance of gas–surface reactions compared to gas-phase reactions next to the material surface. The simulations incorporated reaction probabilities for individual gas–surface collisions based on new reactive scattering data obtained from molecular beam experiments. The experiments provide detailed dynamical data on the scattering of O, , CO, and from a representative material sample, made of vitreous carbon. These experiments indicate that a majority of surface reaction products were produced through thermal mechanisms. For a gas–surface temperature of 800 K, it was found that despite CO being the dominant surface reaction product, a gas-phase reaction forms significant within the microstructure region. The amount of production within the microstructure region was shown to be dependent on the local Knudsen number, based on the exposed microstructure height. Finally, preliminary simulations were performed for a real carbon–carbon surface. The surface topography is obtained through x-ray microtomography of an ablated carbon–carbon sample, which is triangulated and used directly within a direct simulation Monte Carlo simulation of the gas–surface interaction.",54,3

Though the scramjet did not reach the targeted hypersonic flight regime due to the malfunction of the first-stage booster, analysis of the spectral absorption data acquired during the descent flight below 3 km successfully determined pressure and temperature in the inlet and demonstrated that the system was capable of producing an adequate signal-to-noise ratio to allow temperature, pressure, and velocity measurements under the expected hypersonic flight conditions at altitudes up to at least 30 km. This is the first flight-tested tunable diode laser sensor for a scramjet inlet flow, and the robustness and stability of the sensor design in dynamic load conditions were made evident by the quality of the data recorded after a very unstable and high- launch scenario.",54,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054241,"This paper proposes a novel safety-guaranteed flight test environment for more efficient free-flight testing of micro air vehicles. The magnetic suspension and balance system, which has up to now only been employed for sting-free aerodynamic coefficient measurement during wind-tunnel testing, has the potential to be developed as a free-flight test rig. The magnetic suspension and balance control system can be adjusted so that magnetic constraint forces or moments can be removed for certain degrees of freedom, so that a micro air vehicle model inside the magnetic suspension and balance system can move freely in those degrees of freedom. At the same time, the removed magnetic constraint forces or moments can be regenerated when the position or attitude of the model changes beyond designated ranges. In this way, the model can be exposed to free-flight conditions for those degrees of freedom while falling is prevented, even if the model has inherently unstable dynamics. This is the basic idea for the safety guaranteed flight test environment which is herein named the “pseudoflight environment.” The pseudoflight environment allows to conduct some iterative free-flight tests to tune the flight control system in a safe way. It is important to note that a synthetic force or moment can be applied to the micro air vehicle model under the pseudoflight environment for quantitative evaluation of the flight control system because the magnetic forces and moments of the magnetic suspension and balance system can be generated at will. This is another unique feature of the pseudoflight environment that cannot be obtained through existing wind-tunnel tests using mechanical-type balances or real flight tests. The advantages of the proposed idea were experimentally demonstrated with the yaw attitude control systems of a micro air vehicle model.",54,3

The existing model conceptions addressing certain aspects of this phenomenon were complemented and refined to develop a method suitable for parameter studies. Some reliable experimental and numerical results for the Mach 3 supersonic flow over conically nosed bodies were used as training data to estimate empirically the model parameters. Finally, the method was cross validated by the different available results for blunt bodies with hemispherical, flat, and conical front faces. By this opportunity, the ability to predict the influence of some crucial parameters has successfully been demonstrated for the heat input ratio at steady and periodic heating, the normalized heated-wake/filament diameter, the Mach number, and the specific heat capacity.",54,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054215,"Buzz phenomenon is shock oscillation ahead of the supersonic air intake when its mass flow rate is decreasing at off-design condition. The buzz onset and the buzz cycle of an axisymmetric mixed-compression supersonic intake have been experimentally investigated through pressure recording and shadowgraph flow visualization. The intake was designed for a freestream Mach number of 2.0; however, tests were conducted for , 2.0, and 2.2. All tests were performed at 0 deg angle of attack. Results show that there is a strong relation between the acoustic characteristics of the intake and the buzz fluctuations. This relation causes a new pattern for the buzz oscillations, large-amplitude oscillations with large frequency, that has features of both little buzz (Ferri-type instability) and big buzz (Dailey-type instability). Flow separation caused by the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction and acoustic compression waves are the most important driving mechanisms in the buzz cycle. Both amplitude and frequency of the buzz oscillations vary as the backpressure is varied. As the freestream Mach number is increased, the dominant frequency of the buzz oscillations is decreased.",54,3

The benchmark problems include finite element analysis of an axial bar and finite element analysis of a rectangular membrane using unstructured grids. The results are used to establish general guidelines for conducting mesh refinement and selecting the parameters associated with spatial gradient reconstruction calculations.

In the first step, a measured strain is fitted using a piecewise least-squares curve fitting method together with the cubic spline technique. These fitted strains are integrated twice to obtain deflection data along the optical fibers. In the second step, computed deflection along the optical fibers is combined with a finite-element model of the structure in order to interpolate and extrapolate the deflection and slope of the entire structure through the use of the System Equivalent Reduction and Expansion Process. The theory is first validated on a computational model, a cantilevered rectangular plate wing. The theory is then applied to test data from a cantilevered swept-plate wing model. Computed results are compared with finite-element results, results using another strain-based method, and photogrammetry data.

Previous work has shown that the noise produced by the slat can be mitigated through the use of a slat-cove filler. Results from the initial prototype testing led to slat-cove filler concepts that incorporated a segmented structure and superelastic shape-memory alloy materials. A finite-element analysis model, based on the physical prototypes (with a shape profile optimized for maximum noise reduction), was created and used to analyze the slat-cove filler response to aerodynamic and slat retraction loads with the goal of optimization. The objective was minimization of the actuation force needed to retract the slat/slat-cove filler assembly subject to constraints that involved aeroelastic deflection of the slat-cove filler when deployed, maximum stress in the shape-memory alloy flexures, and the required ability of the slat-cove filler to deploy autonomously during slat deployment. The design variables considered included shape-memory alloy flexure thicknesses and lengths of various slat-cove filler components. Design of experiment studies were conducted and used to guide the subsequent optimization. From the optimization, it was found that a monolithic shape-memory alloy slat-cove filler minimized the actuation force while satisfying design constraints, which was consistent with prototype testing results.",54,3
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054171,"According to current art, high-lift devices such as leading-edge slats are essential during the takeoff and landing stages of large transport planes. Because of complexity of the mechanical positioning mechanism and of the specific geometry, there are regions on the main wing that are significantly affected by the slat edge and associated (though not resolved in this study) tip vortices. Under adverse conditions, the vortices degrade the exposed region of the wing performance, which results in lower lift and higher drag. In this experimental study, an airfoil with leading-edge slat was tested for performance enhancement of a thick airfoil section with and without operating active flow control system positioned at the 20% chord location. It was found that the slat improved the overall performance and that the active flow control alone can deliver similar performance gains as the slat for this type of wing section with achievable low actuator control input. Part-span slat configurations, covering 31.8 and 77.3% of the span, were also tested. It was found that there are positive effects of the active flow control system on the airfoil three-dimensional flow field and that, in principle, active flow control can reduce or even eliminate the slat-edge adverse effects altogether.",54,3
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054372,"We investigated the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a freely vibrating, integrally stiffened and/or stepped plate. The stiffeners used here were plate-strip stiffeners as opposed to the normally employed rib stiffeners. Both the plate and stiffeners were analyzed using the first-order shear deformation theory. The deflections and rotations were assumed as a tensor product of Timoshenko beam functions, chosen appropriately according to the given boundary conditions. Unlike Navier and Levy solution techniques, the approach used in this paper can also be applied to fully clamped, free, and cantilever supported stiffened plates. The governing differential equations were solved using the Rayleigh–Ritz method. The development of the stiffness and the mass matrices in the Ritz analysis was found to consume a huge amount of CPU time due to recursive integration of Timoshenko beam functions. An approach is suggested to greatly decrease this amount of CPU time, by replacing the recursive integration in a loop structure in the computer program, with the analytical integration of the integrand in the loop. The numerical results were compared with the solutions available in the literature as well as the commercially available finite-element software ABAQUS®, and the results were found to be highly satisfactory.",54,3
