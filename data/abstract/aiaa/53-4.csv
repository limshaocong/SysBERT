Since 1914, the University has offered a degree program in a field that was to become one of the most important technological developments in the 20th century: the airplane, and later the space vehicle. Michigan’s aeronautical engineering program was the first of its kind. Moreover, throughout its history, it rode the crest of major advancements in aeronautical and space technology. Because of its relevance and importance to all members of the aerospace community today, we tell its story here.",53,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053049,"A process was demonstrated that enables more meaningful comparisons of experimental and large-eddy simulation results of the same flowfield. This approach was motivated by recent studies, which show the importance of modeling the measurement device or process when making comparisons of this nature. In the current case, a large-eddy simulation of a Mach 5 inlet/isolator flow is the subject of the validation process, a flow that was previously validated using particle image velocimetry measurements. In the present study, the particle image velocimetry measurement process is emulated by adding particles with inertia to the large-eddy simulation and using synthetic particle image velocimetry to mimic the process by which velocity data are extracted. Analysis of the particle response reveals modifications to the underlying flow consistent with the original particle image velocimetry measurements, including a drastic decrease in rms velocities in the vicinity of shockwaves and weaker velocity gradients throughout the flow. The synthetic particle image velocimetry is found to capture the sampled particle velocities quite well but does impart a significant bias error to the regions near the walls, also consistent with the experimental data. Furthermore, this process suggests improvements that could be made to any new experiment to achieve higher accuracy and thus improve the validation process.",53,4

The principal goal of HIFiRE flight five is to measure hypersonic boundary-layer transition on a three-dimensional body. The HIFiRE flight tests are supported by a ground test campaign; this paper presents measurements of heat flux and boundary-layer transition in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach-6 Quiet Tunnel. This facility has been developed to provide quiet flow at high Reynolds number, with low noise levels comparable to flight. This tunnel’s good optical access enabled global measurement of the heat flux by means of temperature-sensitive paint. Two modes of transition were observed: transition along the centerline, suspected to arise from the amplification of second-mode waves in the boundary layer, and transition roughly halfway between the centerline and leading edges, probably due to the breakdown of crossflow vortices. Reducing the noise level from conventional to quiet substantially delayed both transition modes. Increasing the angle of attack from 0 to 4 deg delayed the crossflow transition mode on the windward side. Transition moved forward as freestream unit Reynolds number increased from to .",53,4

Structures made from such internal patterns will be called a double-helix tensegrity. This paper derives the connectivity matrix for the double-helix tensegrity class of structures. This generalized common mathematical formulation will allow efficient computations for a large class of tensegrity systems, which can have many different configurations, albeit employing the same rules for connecting components. Special cases of these configurations include torus, cylinders, paraboloids, spheres, ellipsoids, and other configurations.",53,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053266,"To account for vane camber effects in fan/outlet-guide-vane interaction noise prediction, a two stagger-angle method is proposed that extends a flat-plate cascade analytical model. This method is applied to fan tonal noise for which camber effects are known to be significant. First, this camber model is successfully compared to numerical predictions for a two-dimensional cascade/gust interaction test case. The two-stagger-angle method is then applied to an actual axial compressor stage, for which an unsteady flow simulation provides the acoustic sources on the vanes that are radiated with an acoustic analogy and serve as reference data. A clear improvement is obtained in the analytical prediction of modal acoustic power radiated within the duct with the camber method, relatively to the original flat-plate cascade model. Indeed, the gaps with the numerical results are below 1 dB for most of the tones. Moreover, the unsteady loadings are investigated and show that, even if the interaction sources are dominant in the vane leading-edge region, their distribution on the rest of the chord has a major influence on the acoustic prediction.",53,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053227,"A Helmholtz resonator is an important passive control device to abate excessive sound pressure levels. Because of its effectiveness and simplicity (in principle, it consists of an arbitrarily shaped volume and a small duct), it is of high relevance for industrial applications relying on robustness, availability, and reliability. It is the method of choice to counteract high-amplitude combustion-induced pressure oscillations often exhibited in lean premixed gas turbine combustors. Traditional Helmholtz resonators feature an efficient damping performance only in a narrow frequency bandwidth. To derive an efficient design for the full-scale engine, it is key to accurately predict its resonance frequency. In addition to the geometrical dimensions and the speed of sound, this is a function of a length correction term that accounts for inertia effects of the oscillating fluid. In case the Helmholtz resonator is connected to an enclosure of equal density, several empirical correlations for this correction term are available in the literature. However, if density differences between resonator and enclosure exist, as is the case for gas turbine combustion or acoustic liners in aeroengines, the end correction is affected. To the knowledge of the authors, the influence of nonisopycnic conditions on the length correction was not systematically investigated before. In this work, dedicated cold-flow experiments featuring density differences are conducted to investigate this phenomenon, and a density-dependent correction term is derived. A wide range of different densities are realized by blending air and krypton.",53,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053277,"Shape optimization and flow control have been extensively studied in the past to improve the performance of wings and blades. However, they are commonly applied as two separate disciplines, with their interactions being rarely studied. The present work aims to examine and identify the potential to explore the interactions between the two disciplines and is chiefly concerned about two related issues: 1) how much more performance improvement can be obtained by combining the shape optimization with the flow control optimization, and 2) the effects of the sequencing of the disciplines when the optimizations are combined. To address these issues, five optimization approaches have been studied, representing the shaping only, the flow control optimization only, and three different sequencings of the disciplines in the combined optimizations. All the optimization approaches are applied consistently by using the same optimization system developed in this research. The system uses the Kriging surrogate method as the optimization algorithm, and it incorporates a standard computational fluid dynamics solver for which the validity and numerical sensitivities have been assessed. The developed methodology is applied to two optimization cases of practical interest: a compressor blade and a circulation controlled airfoil. The results of both cases show that, when shaping and flow control optimizations are combined, the performance enhancement is considerably higher than when the two disciplines are applied separately. Furthermore, in the combined optimizations for the airfoil, it is observed that the concurrent optimization leads to the highest performance, whereas the sequential optimizations tend to be “stuck” at less optimal solutions.",53,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053251,"Effusion cooling of a laminar flat-plate boundary-layer flow at Mach 2.7 is investigated using direct numerical simulations. Air is employed as hot and cooling gas and is blown in the wall-normal direction through discrete orifices into the boundary layer to generate a cooling film. In the present investigations, the inclusion of the flow in the blowing pipes enables a comparison with modeled blowing where the coolant mass flux and temperature are prescribed in the respective areas at the wall. Attention is turned to 1) the blowing through multiple rows of holes, under the assumption of a fixed plenum pressure for all pipes; 2) the temperature modeling, which plays an important role when the cooling gas and wall temperature differ; and 3) the flow tripping to turbulence by the blowing. It is demonstrated that simple modeling fails for narrow hole spacing, which lowers (together with the pipe/main-flow interaction) the critical blowing ratio for flow tripping.",53,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053287,"Compressive sensing is used to compress and reconstruct a turbulent-flow particle image velocimetry database over a NACA 4412 airfoil. The spatial velocity data at a given time are sufficiently sparse in the discrete cosine transform basis, and the feasibility of compressive sensing for velocity data reconstruction is demonstrated. Application of the proper orthogonal decomposition/principal component analysis on the dataset works better than the compressive-sensing-based reconstruction approach with discrete cosine transform as the basis in terms of the reconstruction error, although the performance gap between the two schemes is not significant. Using the proper orthogonal decomposition/principal component analysis as the sparsifying basis, compressive-sensing-based velocity reconstruction is implemented, which outperformed discrete cosine transform. Compressive sensing preprocessing (filtering) with discrete cosine transform as the basis is applied to a reduced number of particle image velocimetry snapshots (to mimic conditions with limited time support) before application of proper orthogonal decomposition/principal component analysis. Using only 20 particle image velocimetry snapshots with a 10% compressive sensing compression, it is found that the proper orthogonal decomposition/principal component analysis modes 1 and 2 of the streamwise velocity component are very close to those extracted from full time support data (1000 particle image velocimetry snapshots in this case). Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of a compressive-sensing-based approach for reconstruction of compressed or limited time support particle image velocimetry flow data.",53,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053239,Optimization of the three-dimensional unsteady viscous flow near a flapping wing in hover is performed using a time-dependent adjoint-based methodology. The sensitivities of a penalized lift coefficient to wing shape and kinematic parameters are computed using a time-dependent discrete-adjoint formulation. The unsteady discrete-adjoint equations required for the calculation of the sensitivity derivatives are integrated backward in time over the entire interval of interest. The gradient of the objective functional obtained using the adjoint formulation is then used to update the values of shape and kinematic design variables. The efficiency of this adjoint-based methodology is demonstrated by optimizing the shape and kinematics of a hovering wing. The numerical results show that the highest improvement in the wing performance is obtained by using combined optimization of the wing shape and kinematics.,53,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053246,"This paper presents an experimental study on the thermal buckling behavior of sandwich panels with truss cores. The ultimate goal is to find the critical buckling temperature and examine postbuckling behavior of this newly developed sandwich panel experimentally. A specifically designed fixture, which can introduce in-plane loads to the sandwich panel through thermal expansion mismatch between the specimen and the load frame, is applied in the experiment. High-temperature strain gauges are attached at the center of the sandwich panel face sheets to measure the local in-plane response, and the critical buckling temperature of panels deformed in symmetric mode is determined by using the Southwell method. To obtain the full-field postbuckling mode as well as critical buckling temperature of the sandwich panel deformed in asymmetric mode in high-temperature environments, a noncontact measurement system based on the three-dimensional digital image correlation technique is also developed. The accuracy of the present noncontact measurement technique is validated by the coordinate measurement machine technique, a conventional contact measurement method. It is found that the critical buckling temperature obtained from experiments is lower than that predicted by theoretical and numerical models, due to defects and imperfections of the truss core and sandwich panel during fabrication. Full-field measurement also indicates that local yielding together with overall buckling is the typical deformation mode in the tested specimen.",53,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053316,"Dielectric-barrier discharge plasma actuators were mounted on a circular cylinder in a square wave pattern for active forcing of the cylinder wake. The intermittent spacing of the buried electrodes created a spanwise-modulated blowing profile with a spanwise wavelength of four cylinder diameters, such that three-dimensional instabilities in the wake were targeted for control. Considerable spanwise variation in the wake was achieved with low-power forcing when the actuators were mounted at the location of maximum shear layer receptivity. This spanwise variation was a direct consequence of the difference in the vorticity levels of the shed vortices from the cylinder. High power forcing nearly eliminated vortex shedding, leading to a considerable amount of drag reduction as measured in the intermediate wake.",53,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053318,"Despite considerable research on aerodynamic shape optimization, there is no standard benchmark problem allowing researchers to compare results. This work addresses this issue by solving a series of aerodynamic shape optimization problems based on the Common Research Model wing benchmark case defined by the Aerodynamic Design Optimization Discussion Group. The aerodynamic model solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with a Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is used in conjunction with an adjoint method that computes the required derivatives. The drag coefficient is minimized subject to lift, pitching moment, and geometric constraints. A multilevel technique is used to reduce the computational cost of the optimization. A single-point optimization is solved with 720 shape variables using a 28.8-million-cell mesh, reducing the drag by 8.5%. A more realistic design is achieved through a multipoint optimization. Multiple local minima are found when starting from multiple randomly generated geometries, but the minimum drag values are within 0.1 drag counts of each other, and the geometries differ by only 0.4% of the mean aerodynamic chord. The effect of varying the number of shape design variables is examined. The Common Research Model wing benchmark problem proved to be useful for evaluating our design optimization framework, and the geometries and meshes for both the baseline and optimized wings are available as supplemental materials in this paper.",53,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053123,"Emissions measurements and chemiluminescence imaging were performed on a novel multipoint lean direct injection combustor designed for low-NOx emissions and with the flexibility to operate at both high- and low-power settings. The combustor has five rows of fuel nozzles that can be staged in three independent circuits as required. The fuel nozzle stages are not identical; instead, they are optimized for different power settings. NOx, CO, and unburned hydrocarbons were measured for a variety of settings, including lean blowout, idle, intermediate power, and simulated full power. Effects of pressure, inlet temperature, equivalence ratio, and fuel flow distribution were studied. chemiluminescence was used to observe flame structure and interpret emissions trends. The local equivalence ratio, calculated with the fuel and air flow rates particular to each combustor stage, was a useful parameter for interpreting emissions. The combustor demonstrated the ability to operate at a wide range of conditions, from an overall equivalence ratio of 0.55 to lean blowout at 0.079. Low-NOx operation was achieved at high power by using all fuel stages and controlling fuel flow to obtain an even distribution among the nozzles and reduce peak temperatures while using staging to provide good stability at low power.",53,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053328,"The computational budget for designing and optimizing engineering systems has been tightened by the growth in the number of technology alternatives to satisfy the increasingly demanding goals in modern systems and the use of sophisticated, but also computationally burdensome, simulation tools to quantitatively choose the best technology alternative more accurately. This paper develops a new Gaussian process metamodel, which leverages trends in engineering objectives that are similar across derivative concepts, as opposed to current approximation methods that handle concepts independently. This metamodel is based on a multifidelity approach that enhances a new concept prediction with observations of a previous concept with similar trends. The influence of the sizes of the new and the old concept training sets in the performance of the proposed metamodel is explored in this paper. The proposed multifidelity metamodel is tested against traditional independent surrogates in approximating the engine shaft horsepower of a UH-60A modification with a Fenestron tail, where observations from the UH-60A with a conventional tail are available. The proposed metamodels are up to two times as accurate as independent concept modeling for small new concept training sets; then, a multiobjective efficient global optimization algorithm is applied to the proposed metamodel to search for minimal UH-60A power consumption in hover and cruise. This results in Pareto-optimal solutions that are 10% more efficient than the UH-60A baseline.",53,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053304,"In this paper, an efficient mesh deformation technique for hybrid-unstructured grids, based on radial basis functions, has been developed. The principle procedure adopted for this scheme can be divided into two steps. First, a series of radial basis functions are constructed by an interpolation method according to the displacements of moving boundary points. Later, the displacements of all points in the computation domain are determined by the aforementioned radial basis function series. To improve the efficiency, data reduction should be introduced into the interpolation process. Consequently, a multilevel subspace radial basis function interpolation method based on a “double-edged” greedy algorithm is presented to create an approximate interpolation for all moving boundary points. This method is computationally efficient, preserves orthogonality, and has no dependency on the type of flow solver. Typical deformation problems of a LANN wing, DLR-F6 wing–body–nacelle–pylon configuration and DLR-F11 high-lift configuration with hybrid-unstructured grid are selected as the test cases for demonstration of the current implementation. Results show that the present mesh deformation method has good efficiency and robustness for large and complex deformation problems.",53,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053353,"A novel numerical scheme using the combination of flowfield-dependent variation method and arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method is developed. This method is a mixed explicit–implicit numerical scheme, and its implicitness is dependent on the physical properties of the flowfield. The scheme is discretized using the finite-volume method to give flexibility in dealing with complicated geometries. The formulation itself yields a sparse matrix, which can be solved by using any iterative algorithm. Several benchmark problems in two-dimensional inviscid and viscous flow have been selected to validate the method. Good agreement with available experimental and numerical data in the literature has been obtained, thus showing its promising application in complex fluid–structure interaction problems.",53,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053364,"Submicron-particle motion in laminar boundary layers is present in many practical applications. Some important findings on this issue have been achieved during the last decades, but many mechanisms in this process still remain unclear. In the present work, a model has been developed to describe the motion of the submicron particles in supersonic laminar boundary layers above an adiabatic plate along with the mainstream. In this model, the Lagrangian method is used to track the particles and calculate their trajectories, and the Eulerian method to calculate the flowfield. The effects of the entering position, Mach number, and the size and density of the particles were investigated. It is concluded that there are three particle-motion patterns when they enter the supersonic boundary layer, which are departure pattern, equilibrium pattern, and deposition pattern. The drag force and Saffman lift force were discovered to play dominating roles in deciding the patterns, and thermophoretic force and Brownian force are of less importance. A dimensionless number to describe these three patterns is suggested. This work was intended to provide an insight into the submicron-particle motion in the supersonic laminar boundary layer, which can be guidance for industrial applications involving this phenomenon.",53,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053366,"The aerodynamics and flow physics of a NACA 4412 airfoil in ground effect for a wide range of angles of attack from to 20 deg are investigated by numerical simulations. The compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and shear-stress transport turbulence model equations are solved using the finite-volume method. Analyses of the computed results show that the angle of attack versus height (above the ground) plane can be divided into three regions based on the sign of the lift increment value: region I of positive ground effect, and regions II and III of negative ground effect. For low-to-moderate angles of attack, when the ride height is reduced, the airflow is blocked in the convergent passage between the lower surface of the airfoil and the ground, resulting in increase of pressure on the lower surface of the airfoil. As a consequence, the effective angle of attack decreases, and there is less upward deflection of the streamlines, resulting in an increase in pressure on the upper surface of the airfoil. At high angle of attack, when the ride height is reduced, the adverse pressure gradient along the chordwise direction increases, resulting in a larger region of separated flow. Additionally, for negative angle of attack generating negative lift, the airflow accelerates in the convergent–divergent passage between the lower surface and the ground due to the Venturi effect, resulting in a large suction on the lower surface of the airfoil.",53,4
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053371,"The noise generated by a rod–airfoil configuration is investigated using unstructured Large-Eddy simulation coupled with a Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings technique. The detailed experimental database and several numerical simulations available enable an extensive validation of the proposed methodology. Similar or improved results are obtained both in the near field (surface coefficient distributions and velocity profiles) and in the acoustic far field (power spectral densities obtained with both porous and solid surfaces, and directivities) compared with the best and most recent simulations. Dipolar noise radiation at the rod vortex-shedding frequency and its harmonics are found to be dominant. Some additional quadrupolar source contributions are seen at low and high frequencies. The rod is shown to have a significant contribution to the far-field noise at grazing angles. Constructive interferences occur normal to the rod–airfoil axis, whereas destructive interferences appear at grazing angles.",53,4
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053372,"The cost of dimensionality reduction in aerodynamic design applications involving high-dimensional design spaces and computational fluid dynamics is often prohibitive. In an attempt to overcome this challenge, a new method for dimensionality reduction is presented that scales as , where is the number of design variables. It works by taking advantage of adjoint design methods to compute the covariance matrix of the gradient. This information is then used with principal component analysis to develop a linear transformation that allows an aerodynamic optimization problem to be reformulated in an equivalent coordinate system of lower dimensionality. To demonstrate its feasibility, the method is tested on a two-dimensional staggered airfoil problem, intentionally chosen as an abstraction of a more realistic overwing nacelle integration problem, and shown to exhibit similarities with the latter. Results show that the method rivals typical screening methods used in aerospace engineering in terms of effectiveness but outperforms them either in terms of cost or the ability to capture nonlinear effects. Furthermore, the method is found to show good agreement with optimization results obtained without using the method. Overall, results offer strong evidence in support of the proposed approach, setting the stage for larger analytical efforts such as design space exploration, where dimensionality reduction is unavoidable to cope with the necessity of gradient-free approaches.",53,4
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053705,"Implementation of the Kumaresan and Tufts algorithm to liner impedance eduction in a duct with shear flow is described. The approach is based on a noncausal model of sound propagation coupled with singular value decomposition to identify the acoustic pressure modes. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated by comparing the educed impedance spectra to that educed by a benchmark method. Results are presented using both simulated and measured data over a range of test frequencies, three mean flow Mach numbers, and six test liner structures. When simulated data are used, the impedance spectra educed is in perfect agreement with the exact impedance spectra. When measured data are used, it is found that 1) the reduced rank approximation to the prediction matrix increases the accuracy of the educed impedance, 2) the algorithm performs well except at the antiresonant and resonant frequencies of the liner, and 3) at high enough Mach number, the effects of the gradients in the mean flow boundary layer need to be included in the impedance eduction model.",53,4
