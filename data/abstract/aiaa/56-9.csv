The main focus is on the description of the droplet internal flow pattern, which is believed to be one of the dominant factors in initial droplet deformation. The droplet internal flow pattern holds steady for quite a long time after the incident shock passage, and a saddle point is observed for the first time. Accordingly, the saddle point inside the droplet flow is used as a characteristic point to describe the internal flow. Cases of different incident shock strengths are tested, and a theoretical prediction is proposed to delineate the correlation between the saddle point steady position and the strength of the incident shock wave. The numerical cases are found to be in good agreement with the prediction. The present study helps to complete the understanding of the overall droplet aerobreakup phenomenon.",56,9

The inwardly off-center shearing jet-stirred reactor is compared with two traditional jet-stirred reactor designs, the outward cross-injector jet-stirred reactor and the concentric inward and outward jet-stirred reactor. The results show that the present inwardly off-center shearing jet-stirred reactor has significant improvement in terms of mixture uniformity and residence time distribution. Numerical results show the distributions of residence time in the two traditional jet-stirred reactors are wide and long tailed because of the formation of large and stable vortices, and the corresponding mean residence time of the two classical jet-stirred reactors deviates from the theoretical value by about 20%, while the new inwardly off-center shearing jet-stirred reactor has a much narrower residence time distribution and reduces the deviation to 8%, mainly attributed to the smaller vortices generated by an optimized jet arrangement. Moreover, the new inwardly off-center shearing jet-stirred reactor provides a fully optic-accessible platform for kinetic studies of alternative and real jet fuels.",56,9
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056959,"The size of the vertical tail and rudder of a commercial aircraft is influenced by the requirement that the airplane must be controllable in the event of an engine failure. As a result, on twin-engine airplanes, it is typically larger than is required for lateral/directional stability and control under normal flight conditions. Despite the rarity of the need for this level of control, the airplane must carry this size vertical tail and rudder with it at all times. The primary impact of this is additional drag and weight that reduces the fuel efficiency of the airplane. Active flow control can be used to enhance the control authority of the rudder by mitigating flow separation on it at high rudder deflection and sideslip angles. This effect can be used to provide the required level of rudder control authority from a physically smaller vertical tail. As a result, fuel efficiency of the airplane may be increased due to the reduced size and drag of the smaller vertical tail throughout the operational envelope of the airplane. In April 2015, Boeing and NASA tested a pneumatic sweeping-jet-based active flow control system on the vertical tail of the modified Boeing 757 ecoDemonstrator. This test was the culmination of several years of development that included small-scale wind-tunnel testing, computational-fluid-dynamics simulations, a system-integration study, full-scale wind-tunnel testing, and the flight demonstration. The data from the flight test indicate that the flow control actuation may be able to provide an approximately 14% increase in side force at the maximum tested rudder deflection and at critical sideslip angles.",56,9
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056944,"Thermal active flow control has been developed to enhance the efficiency of active flow control systems. The actuation concept is derived from gas-dynamics principles, and it is based on thermal control of the air supply. It is shown that higher air supply temperatures result in reduced mass flow rate with no degradation in active flow control performance. A computational method has been used to systematically investigate the hot air supply approach for isolated blowing actuators and fluidic oscillators. Subsequently, the thermal control concept has been computationally evaluated for airplane applications. These include enhanced control authority of a vertical tail and an airplane high-lift system, confirming the trends observed from the gas-dynamics analysis with regard to reduced actuation input as a function of supply temperature. Further confirmation of the thermal actuation concept was experimentally obtained for a bench-top actuator and a vertical-tail model in a wind-tunnel setting. The paper introduces potential approaches for system integration associated with heated supply, while highlighting the benefit of using available high-temperature sources for active flow control.",56,9

This approach, which exploits the disparity between the onset and relaxation time scales of the embedding flow response, requires brief, anharmonic high-impulse actuation that is difficult to achieve by conventional momentum-based electromechanical actuation. However, investigations over the past decade have demonstrated the utility of chemically based actuation in which controllable high-impulse jets are produced using small-scale combustion-powered actuation. The present paper comprises two parts. The beginning of the paper describes the development of this actuation technology. In the present implementation, high-speed pulsed actuation jets are engendered by the ignition of a mixture of gaseous fuel and air within a cubic-centimeter-scale combustion chamber. The dependence of the actuator’s performance and of the ensuing momentary actuation jet on the composition of the chemical species, the internal geometry, and the flow configuration are characterized using dynamic pressure measurements and flow measurements using particle image velocimetry. The latter part of the paper describes a few examples of aerodynamic flow control using combustion-based pulsed actuation for the mitigation of separated flows over external static and moving aerodynamic surfaces. A fundamental aspect of the receptivity to pulsed actuation is the disparity between the time scales of the attachment and relaxation processes such that a single actuation pulse having a characteristic time scale of 0.05 can lead to brief, partial collapse of the separated flow domain, coupled with a momentary increase in circulation on a time scale that is nearly 200 times longer; and that repetitive actuation results in sustained lift enhancement.",56,9
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056642,"Two active nozzle-injection assemblies integrated with high-frequency, resonance-enhanced microactuators have been developed and characterized in this paper. In design 1, four injection nozzles each diameter were integrated circumferentially to another 1 mm nozzle that provided pulsed flow. This actuation jet had a frequency of 13–21 kHz. Compressed injected through steady nozzles served as the mixing stream, and compressed generated the actuation jet. The second design flipped roles of injection nozzles mentioned in design 1. In this case, the actuation jets pulsed out through the four nozzles, and the steady jet flowed through the 1 mm nozzle. In both cases, the resonance-enhanced microactuators nozzle flow generated a strong compressible vortex in the shear layer of steadily injected fluid that entrained and grew downstream, enhancing microscale mixing of the injected fluid and nitrogen at very high speed and at a designated frequency. This paper discusses the design and characteristics of resonance-enhanced microactuators nozzles, a potential active injection scheme that can be used for efficient and controlled flow mixing in high-speed applications.",56,9

Evolution of vortex strength, determined using circulation, and distribution of vortices, determined using contours of helicity, are also compared. Results show that secondary vortices emerge stronger, and liftoff heights drop, with the introduction of slot (slotted micro vortex generator) or gaps (split-ramp micro vortex generator). Near-surface contours of axial velocity and integral properties of the boundary layer are then compared to evaluate the effects of the evolution of the vortical structures on the flowfield. Results shows that the split-ramp device results in the most energetic near-surface flow but the worst outgoing boundary-layer integral properties, whereas the slotted-ramp devices with taper fare well on both counts. The computations performed in this work involve supersonic flow past single micro vortex generators at Mach 2.5 and use an immersed-boundary method to render the control devices. The flow solver is suitable for high-speed turbulent flows and has been extensively validated in earlier works. The turbulence model used is Menter’s shear-stress transport version.",56,9
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057074,"Flight vehicles with pointed forebodies experience large side forces and yaw moments at high angles of incidence due to random surface imperfections. These adverse side forces and yaw moments are the results of asymmetric vortices on conical bodies. To better understand the underlying flow physics associated with slender cones at high angles of incidence, an experimental investigation was conducted on a conventionally machined and a highly polished cone at subsonic speeds. Measurements included force and moments and velocity field using particle image velocimetry. Force measurement results show that the side-force magnitude and its dependence on roll orientation can be significantly reduced by polishing the cone surface. The results indicate that the ratio of imperfection height to the local crossflow boundary-layer thickness is a pertinent parameter influencing the location and growth of vortices. The region of incipient boundary-layer separation was found to be very sensitive to the presence of surface imperfections. By judiciously selecting the size and location of surface imperfections, significant changes can be made to the entire flowfield. Simultaneous force and time-resolved velocity measurements elucidate that the vortex switching with roll orientation for a cone at a high angle of incidence is a gradual process.",56,9
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056589,"Riblets are one of the most interesting passive drag reduction techniques. They essentially consist of streamwise grooved surfaces. Despite interest in these devices, the literature does not offer numerical simulations of riblets in the presence of pressure gradient or more generally around complex aeronautical configurations because, due to their scale length (microns), direct simulations are unfeasible. In the present paper an accurate and efficient method for the numerical simulation of riblets around complex aeronautical configurations is proposed. Riblets are modeled by a proper wall boundary condition based on the slip length concept. Slip length concept has been used by many authors in different fields; in the present paper a relation between the slip length and riblet height valid also in nonlinear range of drag reduction curve is proposed for the first time. This new boundary condition has been implemented in a standard code solving the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Validation tests in subsonic and transonic flows are performed comparing the results with the available experimental data. The analysis provides an interesting insight into riblets performance in the presence of the pressure gradient. Drag reduction improvement evidenced in some experiments is still debated because it seems to contradict the fact that riblet effect is confined very near to the surface (i.e., it is a local effect) and an explanation was never proposed until now. The present analysis provides a first contribution to understand why riblet performance can improve in the case of airfoil flow.",56,9

The effect of adverse pressure gradients on wall pressure spectra and the relationship between the boundary-layer parameters and the wall pressure are studied and demonstrated. A dataset for five experiments at four different test facilities, covering Reynolds number between and based on the boundary-layer momentum thickness, is selected to develop the new model. Goody’s model is served as the basis for the development. Predictions of the new model and comparisons with other published wall pressure spectral models for adverse pressure gradient boundary layers are made for the selected dataset. The new model shows good prediction accuracy for the selected dataset and a significant improvement compared to the other published models.",56,9
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056926,"Thermoacoustic instability is a plaguing problem encountered in many combustion systems. The large-amplitude acoustic oscillations, which are a noted aspect of this instability, can have a detrimental effect on the performance of the system; and they sometimes even cause lasting damage to the system components. The aim of this study is to estimate the amplitude of the limit-cycle oscillations observed during thermoacoustic instability corresponding to the axial acoustic modes using pressure measurements acquired during stable combustion. First, an equation is derived that describes the slow-varying amplitude of oscillations in certain reduced-order models of combustion systems involving vortex shedding. Subsequently, a procedure is detailed, wherein this equation is used in conjunction with the measured pressure time series and some information about the system to predict the instability amplitude. The estimation capability of this technique is then tested using acoustic pressure data obtained from laboratory-scale bluff-body and swirl-stabilized combustors. It is observed that the estimated amplitudes are in good agreement with actual values.",56,9
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056699,"A new theoretical model is established to study the breakup of a charged power-law liquid jet, which is moving in coaxial swirling air. The liquid non-Newtonian behavior is explained by the power-law model, which is assumed to be the leaky dielectric material in this paper. The corresponding dispersion relation about the radical electrical field is derived by linear analysis. Results show that when the air swirl is introduced, the changing trend of the unstable growth rate on the axisymmetric mode is the same as the nonaxisymmetric ones. It is noted that the air swirl is one of the factors that stabilize the power-law liquid jet. Moreover, the effects of the electric field and the Weber number on the jet instability are examined on the temporal mode. Especially, when the electrostatic force increases to a threshold value, the effect of the air swirl is almost negligible on the jet breakup. Finally, the difference can be revealed between the Newtonian and the non-Newtonian liquid jets by investigating the effect of the power-law index.",56,9
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056434,"An experimental investigation into the coupling behavior of screeching axisymmetric twin supersonic jets is presented. Acoustic measurements and schlieren photography are used to identify four distinct coupling modes over a wide range of pressure ratios and nozzle spacings. Nozzle spacing is found to have a significant effect on the selection of these modes as well as the transition between them. A discrete jump in the peak screech frequency is seen to accompany most but not all mode switches. Statistical analysis of schlieren photography provides evidence that the modes consist of two flapping (symmetric and antisymmetric) and two different helical oscillations. These coupling modes are shown to have a limited effect on the convection velocity of the large-scale structures within the jet, and as such, the characteristic length scales are investigated as a source of mode switching.",56,9
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057261,"In previous work, a new compressive-sensing-based method for ducted aeroengine fan noise tests was proposed. The current paper reports the details of the validated aeroengine fan noise test method and the wind-tunnel test results for the validation. The experimental setup consists of a uniform oncoming jet to simulate the oncoming flow experienced by the duct, a mode synthesizer to generate different modes of characteristic fan noise, and a sensor array to conduct mode detection in the presence of background flow with background noise interference. The main attention is primarily focused on the examination of the associated reconstruction accuracy and the probability of success for spinning mode detection with high background noise interference. The test results clearly show the potential capability of the proposed new fan mode detection method for aeroengine aeroacoustics tests in a practical testing facility.",56,9
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056491,"This paper presents a boundary-field integral formulation suitable for the prediction of noise scattered by moving bodies. Although based on the same flow modeling assumptions, linear formulations derived from velocity potential or pressure disturbance wave equations provide different predictions when the scatterer is not at rest. Indeed, the discrepancies reside in the different influence of the neglected nonlinear terms. Here, a velocity potential-based approach is developed by extracting the first-order contributions from the nonlinear terms. This yields a linearized boundary-field, frequency-domain formulation for the scattered potential that, extending the standard linear boundary integral approach, takes into account the effects of mean flow nonuniformity. The influence of the additional field contributions is examined for different scatterer velocities, with the aim of assessing the domain of validity of the fully linear formulation and the rate of growth of the field contributions with increase of velocity. Specifically, the numerical investigation concerns the noise scattered by a moving, nonlifting wing, when impinged by an acoustic disturbance generated by a co-moving point source.",56,9

The baseline configuration of the NASA source-diagnostic-test geometry with the entire hard-wall nacelle is solved by using the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation at approach and takeoff conditions. Following a paper by Shur et al. (“Unsteady Simulations of a Fan/Outlet-Guide-Vane System: Aerodynamics and Turbulence,” AIAA Journal, 2018), which focused on the simulation methodology for the turbulence treatment and the aerodynamics, this paper investigates noise-generation/propagation phenomena of the first and second blade-passing-frequency tones: The analyses include mode decomposition of the tone power levels, their comparison with the NASA source diagnostic test data, nonlinear propagation of rotor-locked tones in the inlet, and the unsteady response of the stator against the rotor viscous wakes. With a duct-mode-matching method, the improved delayed detached-eddy simulation can predict tone levels within 6 dB and usually less, except for the rotor-locked tones. Although both simulations capture nonlinear decay in the inlet, “identical blade” simulations are unable to redistribute the energy into multiple pure tones at the takeoff speed. In the viscous-wake/outlet-guide-vane interaction, unsteady stator responses computed by both simulations seem not to be in accordance with classical models; moreover, the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation can predict only cut-on tone levels due to the lack of turbulence contents.",56,9
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056492,"The spectrum of a hypersonic three-dimensional boundary layer at Mach 6 is investigated with linear stability theory. It is shown that the three-dimensional wave of Mode S of discrete spectrum can be excited by the slow acoustic wave of continuous spectrum near the leading edge, and Mode S can evolve into the unstable traveling wave of crossflow mode in the downstream region. Furthermore, the influences of freestream slow acoustic waves on the instability of the hypersonic three-dimensional boundary layer in the presence of stationary crossflow vortices are also studied. Specifically, the downstream evolutions of traveling crossflow waves stemming from slow acoustic waves inside the boundary layer distorted by stationary crossflow vortices are investigated through biglobal analysis. It is found that the traveling crossflow waves evolve to the low-frequency mode III when the hypersonic three-dimensional boundary-layer flow is distorted by stationary crossflow vortices. The growth rates of the traveling crossflow waves with low frequency are hindered due to the finite amplitude of the stationary crossflow vortices in the downstream region. However, the traveling crossflow waves with high frequency can be significantly amplified by stationary crossflow vortices. The mode shapes of the traveling crossflow waves with high frequency look similar to that of the secondary instability modes, indicating that the modes can extract the energy through the spanwsie shear or wall-normal shear of the modified basic state. It is concluded that the breakdown of stationary crossflow vortices can be triggered by the freestream slow acoustic waves.",56,9
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057015,"A thermoacoustic interpretation of Mack’s second-mode instability is proposed. It is demonstrated that the fundamental mechanism of second-mode wave growth in hypersonic boundary layers is consistent with standing-wave thermoacoustically driven instability. The resonant nature of such modes is sustained by an acoustic impedance well between the wall (infinite impedance) and near the sonic line (secondary peak in impedance). A Lagrangian approach is adopted to show that such resonant standing waves derive energy from the base flow through thermoacoustic Reynolds stress, which results from the divergence of acoustic power inside the impedance well, and thermodynamic work. This treatment does not represent a complete energy closure (due to the neglect of viscosity), but it does provide insight toward a fundamental energy source and the physical mechanisms governing Mack’s acoustic second mode.",56,9
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056953,"The aeroheating performance of hypersonic vehicles is usually significantly influenced by the chemical reaction processes. For the new-generation hypersonic cruise vehicles, the boundary-layer flow is shown to be in chemical nonequilibrium due to rarefied gas effects. As a result, there will be a competition between the homogeneous recombination of atoms in the near-wall flowfield and the heterogeneous recombination on the catalytic wall surface, which, leading to a coupling of the heat diffusion and conduction, is beyond the application scope of the classical theories developed originally for the traditional blunt reentry vehicles. In this paper, the theoretical modeling and the direct simulation Monte Carlo method are employed to study the corresponding rarefied nonequilibrium flow and heat transfer phenomena near the sharp leading edges. A generalized model is proposed to evaluate the deviation of the actual aeroheating performance from the classical description. Based on this model, an integrated nonequilibrium criterion and a simple but effective bridging function are introduced to predict the stagnation-point heat transfer under the competitive effects between the homogeneous and heterogeneous recombination of atoms. The analytical formula is validated by the numerical results under various flow conditions.",56,9
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056761,"Experiments were carried out on a scaled model of scramjet engine with gaseous hydrogen as a fuel in a 1 m combustion-driven shock tunnel. The simulated enthalpy was , at a freestream Mach number of 6.8 with varying stagnation pressures (110–190 bar), dynamic pressures (72–130 kPa), and equivalence ratio (0.24–1.16). Detailed studies were carried out to tailor the shock tunnel. Experiments were carried out with air and as the test gases with hydrogen injection to bring out the difference between reactive and nonreactive cases. Pressure measurement along the centerline of the engine and heat flux (through temperature measurements) inside the combustor was carried. The occurrence of supersonic combustion was ascertained through pressure measurements where no upstream influence was seen ahead of the strut injector and the same was corroborated by heat flux measurements. The pressure rise due to supersonic combustion downstream of the fuel injection was nearly three times as compared with nonreactive case. For the current case, when the combustor inlet pressure exceeds 1 bar, a sharp rise in the pressure signature was observed downstream of fuel injection, whereas no such marked trace was seen when is below 1 bar.",56,9
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056572,"This study focuses on the development of time-marching procedures for efficient and accurate fluid-thermal-structural analysis with time-accurate computational fluid dynamics. The developed procedures are based on a loosely coupled, partitioned framework for the fluid, thermal, and structural solvers—each with different second-order time integrators. The procedures also implement subcycling, where disparate time scales between the solvers are leveraged to minimize communication between solvers. The first scheme uses a second-order predictor of fluid loads, along with second-order interpolations of structural and thermal solutions. The second scheme is an extension that adds a corrector step to the structural and thermal solvers. The two schemes are benchmarked against both a strongly coupled approach with subiterations and a basic loosely coupled approach that omits the use of predictors/correctors. The schemes are examined in the context of the aerothermoelastic response of a panel in high supersonic flow, and are found to maintain second-order time accuracy with and without subcycling. Furthermore the approaches compare favorably against a strongly coupled approach at significantly reduced computational times, with the predictor-corrector approach yielding speedups of 2–4 times. In comparison, a basic scheme can yield characteristically different behavior.",56,9
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056405,"This paper describes a methodology, called local decomposition method, which aims at building a surrogate model based on steady turbulent aerodynamic fields at multiple operating conditions. The various shapes taken by the aerodynamic fields due to the multiple operation conditions pose real challenges as well as the computational cost of the high-fidelity simulations. The developed strategy mitigates these issues by combining traditional surrogate models and machine learning. The central idea is to separate the solutions with a subsonic behavior from the transonic and high-gradient solutions. First, a shock sensor extracts a feature corresponding to the presence of discontinuities, easing the clustering of the simulations by an unsupervised learning algorithm. Second, a supervised learning algorithm divides the parameter space into subdomains, associated to different flow regimes. Local reduced-order models are built on each subdomain using proper orthogonal decomposition coupled with a multivariate interpolation tool. Finally, an improved resampling technique taking advantage of the subdomain decomposition minimizes the redundancy of sampling. The methodology is assessed on the turbulent two-dimensional flow around the RAE2822 transonic airfoil. It exhibits a significant improvement in terms of prediction accuracy for the developed strategy compared with the classical method of surrogate modeling.",56,9

Shock-related nonunique numerical solutions of the Euler equation are presented in this system, which indicates that this simple system keeps the essential characteristics of numerical shock instability. The stability analysis of this system was conducted, and some important results were obtained. Carbuncle phenomena were shown to originate from multidimensional instability of the upstream shock cell. The numerical shock instability essentially starts from the grid face perpendicular to the shock rather than the grid parallel to it. The analytical eigenvalue analysis of the linearized equations showed that inappropriate pressure dissipation of Riemann solver at the vertical transverse face of a shock was responsible for the carbuncle phenomena and shock instability. Based on the mechanism that was identified, a fundamental cure principle was proposed. These new findings can serve as a basis for understanding the numerical shock instabilities presented in one-dimensional Riemann-solver-based numerical schemes as well as in designing shock-stable schemes.",56,9

The stability of the modified scheme was analyzed by a linear stability method, and completely negative values of maximum real part eigenvalues of the linearized system were realized, which indicates the effectiveness of this method.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056550,"Mesh generation for high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations and aerodynamic shape optimization is a time-consuming task. Complex geometries can be accurately modeled using overset meshes, whereby multiple high-quality structured meshes corresponding to different aircraft components overlap to model the full aircraft configuration. However, from the standpoint of geometry manipulation, most methods operate on the entire geometry rather than on separate components, which diminishes the advantages of overset meshes. To address this issue, a geometry module is introduced that operates on individual components and automatically computes their intersections to update overset meshes during optimization. Reverse-mode automatic differentiation is applied to compute partial derivatives across this geometry module so that it fits into an optimization framework that uses a hybrid adjoint method (known as ADjoint) to efficiently compute gradients for a large number of design variables. By using these automatically updated meshes and the corresponding derivatives, the aerodynamic shape of the DLR-F6 geometry is optimized while allowing changes in the wing–fuselage intersection. Sixteen design variables control the fuselage shape, and 128 design variables determine the wing surface. Under transonic flight conditions, the optimization reduces drag by 15 counts (5%) as compared with the baseline design.",56,9

A rotor testing facility, Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS) Laboratory, was introduced to reproduce natural icing condition and representative ice shapes typically found on engine inlet guide vanes. A total of 42 cases from 14 different icing conditions were conducted and used for high-speed visualization of ice impact tests and model development. Ice particles were analyzed using image postprocessing techniques and correlated using statistical tools. A cut-off in size range for analysis was found necessary before applying an energy-statistical method for model development. A cut-off criterion that related to the fracture stress, strain rate, and fracture toughness was implemented and compared with existing literature. After applying size cut-off, a Rosin-Rammler distribution was fitted to obtain mass-weighted particle distribution. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) was first formulated with comparison to an existing correlation based on hailstone impact experiments. The AERTS prediction successfully matched with experimental measurements, whereas the hailstone correlation constantly overestimate the size distribution. In addition, a probabilistic distribution function (PDF) was used to categorize the postimpact size distribution. The particle cloud was segmented into three groups weighted by mass (16%, 68%, and 16%). This technique provides a simple categorization method of a complicated impact fragmentation process. Instead of simulating the fracturing physics, a group of particles with three categories of particle sizes can be used as initial condition for postimpact aerothermal simulations that can significantly simplify computational fluid dynamics modeling complexity.

26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056806,"The existence of debonding defects in thermal barrier coatings is one of the key problems that result in the premature failure of blades. In this paper, a line heat-source scanning thermography method for locating the defects in blades with unpainted thermal barrier coatings is developed. Compared with planar specimens, uneven temperature distribution in the blade surface is an unavoidable problem when using a line heat source because the complex shape of the blade makes the heat absorbed nonuniform. This unevenness shields the thermal response features of the defects and disturbs the identification of the defects. The developed window-averaged carrier postprocessing algorithm can solve this problem to achieve nondestructive testing of debondings. Apart from inspecting defects, a projected infrared fringe method is developed to reconstruct the three-dimensional morphology of the blade surface by analyzing the relationship between the temperature fringes modulated by surface morphology and surface height. In addition, a new manufacturing technique of artificial debondings is proposed by filling a groove with ceramic hollow particles. Nondestructive testing experiments on a blade with artificial debondings show that the methods and technique developed here have the potential to locate the three-dimensional spatial position of debondings in a scanning process.",56,9

Two approaches are proposed to determine the training signal for identification of the nonlinear terms. Aeroelastic analysis of a weakened wall-mounted AGARD 445.6 wing is conducted and it is demonstrated that 1) the nonlinear state-space ROM can get more accurate unsteady aeroelastic response than traditional linear Volterra-based ROM with computational fluid dynamics coupling with computational structural dynamic as a reference method for comparison; 2) the nonlinear state-space ROM performs well in range of subsonic, transonic, and supersonic; and 3) the nonlinear state-space ROM can better characterize the nonlinear aeroelastic system than traditional linear Volterra-based ROM without the need of identifying second-order Volterra kernels, which thus can be easily applied to solve engineering problems for its concise form.",56,9
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056760,"Nonlinear reduced-order modeling approaches have been a promising tool for predicting the transonic aerodynamic and aeroelastic behaviors of aircraft structures. However, the accuracy of the approaches in predicting the transonic limit-cycle oscillations and aeroservoelastic behaviors needs to be further improved. For example, because of the complexity induced by the coupling among deflection of control surfaces, oscillating shock waves, structural vibration, and aerodynamic viscosity, it is difficult to adjust the system order and number of neurons of the Wiener-based reduced-order model. Moreover, the increasing of the system order may lead to overfitting. This paper presents a novel reduced-order aerodynamic modeling methodology based on the theory of nonlinear state-space identification. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated for predicting aerodynamic loads, limit-cycle oscillations, and frequency responses of aeroservoelastic systems at transonic flow conditions.

29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056924,"Focusing on the aeroelastic stability of heated flexible panel in shock-dominated flows with arbitrary shock impingement location condition, a systematic theoretical analysis model is established. The von-Karman large deflection theory is used to account for the geometrical nonlinearity. Local first-order piston theory is employed in the region before and after shock to estimate the aerodynamic pressure. The results show that the shock impingement location has a significant effect on the stability of the flexible panel. The change of the critical dynamic pressure (for which flutter onset occurs) is not a monotonic function of the shock impingement point from one endpoint to the other. Specifically, the nondimensional critical flutter dynamic pressure increases as the shock impingement points move from the left to the right in the middle region, and the value of the critical flutter dynamic pressure varies substantially as the shock is located near the boundary of the panel. The variation is larger for higher shock strength. For a large shock strength, panel can buckle (or diverge) rather than only flutter even without thermal stresses. The sensitivity of the panel dynamics to the shock impingement location may have interesting implications for the case of a moving incident shock.",56,9
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056927,"A dual optimization method for optimizing contact-aided compliant mechanism design parameters and their spatial distribution in a dynamic ornithopter wing structure for increased pitch agility is presented. This methodology separates the task into two separate optimization problems where, first, a computationally efficient rigid-body dynamics model is used to determine the optimal stiffness and spatial distribution of the compliant mechanisms and, second, a detailed compliant mechanism design is developed and optimized that achieves the desired nonlinear stiffness. A rigid-body mechanics model of the wing structure is used to find the location and stiffness of a contact-aided compliant mechanism that will induce the forward sweep passively by coupling lift loads to forward sweep. The forward-swept compliant mechanism is then developed and optimized to achieve the desirable coupling. The free-flight pitch agility of an ornithopter is shown to increase via sweeping the wings forward during downstroke. A free-flight experiment is performed, and the novel contact-aided compliant mechanism is shown to induce the desired forward sweep during downstroke.",56,9
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056942,"Typically, numerical or approximate methods are used for the free vibration analysis of axially loaded Euler–Bernoulli beams because the governing differential equation does not yield an exact solution, even for uniform beams. However, for certain polynomial variations of the mass and stiffness, there exists a fundamental closed-form solution to the fourth-order governing differential equation, which is used to design axially loaded, cantilever beams having a prespecified fundamental natural frequency. In the presence of uncertainty, this flexural stiffness is treated as a spatial random field. For several known probability distributions (normal, log-normal, Weibull, Gumbel, and exponential) of the natural frequencies, the corresponding distributions of this field are determined analytically. These analytical expressions can serve as benchmark solutions for different statistical simulation tools to find the probabilistic nature of the stiffness distribution for known probability distributions of the frequencies. The analytical solution corresponding to the normal distribution is further used to derive the coefficient of variation of the stiffness distribution for a rotating cantilever beam, which is further used as an example problem to optimize the beam profile to maximize the allowable tolerance during manufacturing. An example of such a beam with a rectangular cross section is provided. The effects of the length of the beam and the uniform rotation speed on the optimal beam profile are also studied.",56,9
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056857,"This paper investigates the microvibration induced by a pulse tube cryocooler mounting on a space camera, and it describes a full methodology and experimental verification to deal with microvibration predictions. A coupled transfer function matrix is introduced by improving the traditional disturbance model, which is apt to be more representative of the real boundary conditions. The coupled method corrects the microvibration input load by using force filters that depend on estimations of the interface accelerances. The impact of microvibration is predicted, based on transfer functions found from the modeled camera. A system-level microvibration test is performed to verify the predicted results. Dynamic coupling is shown to exist. After integrating the finite element analysis results with the optics design software, the performance of the optical system represented by the modulation transfer function is analyzed. The results show that the surface deformations caused by cooler microvibration are very small, which can be neglected compared with the rigid-body motion. This approach accurately predicts the microvibration and its influences, which provides a new way to analyze the microvibration of an optical load on spacecraft.",56,9
