0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052691,"The concept of passive surface error control via tension is explored for flexible square panels and for a rectangular array of such panels suspended with four catenaries. The panels are 1 mm thick 1 m square graphite-epoxy composite plates with a four-ply symmetric layup. Individual panel response to a uniform through-thickness temperature gradient field both alone and combined with in-plane tension (stretch) are examined. When integrated into a grid (a simple phased array configuration), the effects of a transient slew are considered. Characteristic responses are identified and studied symbolically as well as numerically. The results demonstrate the feasibility of combined global and component-level error suppression for the considered structure, exercised singularly by global prestress that also maintains the integrity of the tension structure. Limited attention is paid to mission-specific issues such as stowage and deployment. Assuming an X-band radar context, surface errors are related to a 1 mm limit. Out-of-flatness is evaluated with three metrics relevant to different aspects of signal processing: the maximum depth of the deformed surface, its maximum lateral deviation from the best-fit plane, and the phased-array radiometric rms surface error.",53,3
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052969,"A fast low-order computational approach is presented for estimating the aero-optic effect of the rotor tip vortex system on helicopter-borne optical systems. The approach employs prescribed-wake methods that have been developed by the helicopter design community to rapidly generate realistic approximations to the vortex-wake systems of helicopters in hover and forward flight. With the geometry of the vortex-wake system defined, an experimentally validated computational method that employs the isentropic assumption is then used to compute pressure, temperature, density, and index-of-refraction fields in the selected computational domain. Predictions determined using the computational approach for the spatially and temporally resolved aero-optic aberrations on an optical system mounted on a helicopter in hover and forward flight are presented.",53,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052410,A low-order phenomenological model relating dynamic wing motion to thrust production of micro flapping wings with different stiffness was examined. The motivation is toward closed-loop flight control of flapping micro air vehicles. The low-order model was based on a “black box” state-space description that used the intraperiod flapping-wing motion as input to determine modeling coefficients that minimized the error between the predicted and actual intracycle thrust. The data time series used in the modeling were provided by a companion experiment with three flapping wings of different designs and stiffness. The wings were fabricated from laminated carbon-fiber strips that were covered by a thin polyvinylidene fluoride film sheet. The wings had a span of 12.5 cm and were attached to a commercial Cybird gearbox that could be operated at different flapping frequencies. Digital high-speed video was used to determine the dynamic displacement of the wing structure. The intraperiod wing displacement was quantified using digital image processing of each video frame. The low-order model successfully captured the dynamic thrust generation within a flapping cycle and produced the correct scaling of the peak thrust with flapping frequency for all three wing designs. The model mean thrust frequency scaling agreed with the experiments if the peak thrust was within approximately 40% of the cycle-averaged thrust. A modification of the model is suggested when that difference is too large.,53,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053128,"A finite-element method based on the streamline-upwind/Petrov–Galerkin stabilization technique is developed to solve the compressible Euler equations. The method is extended for computing unsteady small disturbances in the flow domain as a result of boundary motion, which is applied through the linearized solid-wall boundary condition. The method is able to calculate the frequency-dependent generalized aerodynamic forces without any need for deformation of mesh inside the flow domain. Error estimates are used to drive automated -refinement of mesh for steady-state and frequency-domain calculations. Steady-state solutions and generalized aerodynamic forces are compared to benchmark data for transonic and supersonic Mach numbers. The results show that the presence of shocks in the flow makes it difficult to use a single mesh for all computations, including the linearized flow. The -refinement procedure is shown to be an effective way of ensuring reliable computations for the nonlinear and linearized solvers. Some associated challenges with the refinement procedure are also highlighted.",53,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053139,"The development of a nonintrusive microwave shock-speed measurement for expansion tunnels is presented, based on microwave standing-wave reflection. Testing is performed in a large-scale expansion-tunnel facility, with the goal of characterizing viscous effects. Expansion tunnels generate high-enthalpy test conditions for short test times, and the test gas is never heated such that excessive freestream dissociation or ionization occurs. The microwave system measures primary and secondary shock speeds accurately and with high spatial resolution along the length of the facility, yielding more accurate freestream conditions. It is shown to be both practical and low cost. The high spatial resolution along the tunnel is used to assess shock-speed attenuation. Negligible shock attenuation is found over a wide range of test conditions and gases, attributed to the large diameter of the facility’s driven and expansion tubes. Shock-tube boundary-layer growth solutions based on Mirels’s theory ( “ Shock Tube Test Time Limitation Due to Turbulent-Wall Boundary Layer ,” AIAA Journal , Vol.  2 , No.  1 , 1964 , pp.  84 – 93 ) and a Pitot-probe survey confirm that, in the current facility, the test conditions should not be adversely affected by viscous effects. Mirels’s theory is also used to determine the displacement thicknesses for quasi-one-dimensional analyses, showing how viscous effects become significant in long, smaller-diameter facilities. The high spatial resolution allows for local shock-speed information to evaluate nonideal secondary-diaphragm ruptures. Additionally, when postshock electron-density levels are near the cutoff required for standing-wave reflection, test-gas velocities are measured rather than shock velocities.",53,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053196,"This work explores the breakdown of the wake downstream of the Model Experiments in Controlled Conditions Project (known as the MEXICO project) wind-turbine rotor and assesses the capability of computational fluid dynamics in predicting its correct physical mechanism. The wake is resolved on a fine mesh able to capture the vortices up to eight rotor radii downstream of the blades. At a wind speed of , the main frequency present in the computational fluid dynamics signals for up to four radii was the blade-passing frequency (21.4 Hz), where the vortex cores fall on a perfect spiral. Between four and five radii downstream, higher-frequency content was present, which indicated the onset of instabilities and results in vortex pairing. The effect of modeling a 120 deg azimuthally periodic domain and a 360 deg three-bladed rotor domain was studied, showing similar predictions for the location of the onset of instabilities. An increased frequency content was captured in the latter case. Empirical and wake models were also explored, they were compared with computational fluid dynamics, and a combination of kinematic and field models was proposed. The obtained results are encouraging and suggest that the wake instability of wind turbines can be predicted with computational fluid dynamics methods, provided adequate mesh resolution is used.",53,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053166,"A theoretical framework is presented for modeling active vibration control of smart multilayered plates integrated with piezoceramic sensors and actuators, considering their constitutive nonlinearity under a strong electric field. The application of an electric field beyond the linear threshold limit of piezoelectric materials is often necessary to achieve high actuation authority. A recently developed efficient layerwise theory, for which the computational efficiency and accuracy have been well established for linear electromechanical response, is employed for the laminate mechanics. The nonlinear finite element model for dynamic response is developed consistently using a variational principle, considering a rotationally invariant second-order constitutive relationship for piezoelectric materials. The nonlinear system is transformed to an equivalent linear system using the feedback linearization approach, through control input transformation. The linear quadratic Gaussian controller is adopted for control of the equivalent system. Results are presented for a smart sandwich plate under step, impulse, and sinusoidal excitations. It is revealed that, using the piezoelectric nonlinearity, the vibration control can be achieved at a much lower actuation potential than predicted by the linear model. While in the linear model, the control voltage is almost independent of the actuator thickness, and its nonlinear prediction reduces significantly with the decrease in the actuator thickness.",53,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053207,"An extensive parametric study of the response of a Blasius boundary layer to forcing by spanwise arrays of plasma actuators was performed. The actuator arrays are designed to produce streamwise-oriented vortex pairs, which cause streaks of alternating low and high streamwise velocity. This work is motivated by the closed-loop control of bypass transition. The streaks are measured using hot-wire anemometry over a streamwise distance of approximately 100 boundary-layer thicknesses. The resulting spanwise periodic disturbance velocity is decomposed into spanwise Fourier modes. Typically, at least 90% of the disturbance energy is contained within a mode related to the spanwise spacing of the exposed electrodes and its first three harmonics. Along the streamwise direction, the growth and decay characteristics of the disturbance are considered for various actuator geometries, as well as excitation voltages and frequencies for a freestream velocity of . The total disturbance energy is shown to scale with the actuator power consumption. Changes in the excitation voltage influence the energy distribution between Fourier modes due to the effect of voltage on the plasma extent and plasma-induced velocity, which changes the separation between vortices generated by the actuators. The induced disturbance is found to be most closely represented by a single Fourier mode when the electrode width is approximately one-third of the electrode spacing. For the other electrode width, significant energy appears at higher harmonics of the electrode spacing.",53,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053206,"Wind-tunnel measurements were used to identify and characterize the low-frequency oscillation present in the flowfield about an NACA 0012 airfoil with a horn-ice shape. This low-frequency mode was identified in the unsteady content of the airfoil lift coefficient and the corresponding Strouhal numbers compared well with those reported in the literature. To study the relationship between the ice-induced separation bubble dynamics and the airfoil circulation, the unsteady shear-layer reattachment location was determined using measurements from a surface-mounted hot-film array. At the low-frequency mode, the lift coefficient led the reattachment location by a phase of . Additional characterization of the relationship between the unsteady shear-layer reattachment location and the unsteady airfoil pressure distribution was also completed, along with an analysis of the convective qualities of the low-frequency oscillation throughout the airfoil pressure distribution.",53,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053118,"A solution procedure for the fully coupled Navier–Stokes and Maxwell equations is described. The approach implements a conservative fluid formulation in which the Lorentz body force and Ohmic heating terms are recast as convective terms. This removes explicit sources from the fluid equations, which have previously introduced severe stiffness and demanded a very delicate numerical treatment. The coupling with the full Maxwell equations enables displacement current effects, charge separation effects, low-conductivity plasma behavior, and electromagnetic wave propagation to be incorporated directly. To circumvent the issue of complicated eigenvectors, an AUSM-type flux splitting scheme is proposed. Validation of the approach is presented for problems of electromagnetic wave propagation in low-conductivity plasma and high-conductivity magnetohydrodynamic problems, which demonstrates a robust, unified hyperbolic method for resolving both the wave and diffusion limits of the electromagnetic behavior in the plasma.",53,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053208,"The physical mechanism responsible for impact ice adhesion variations for different coatings is not well understood. This research examines the effects of surface characteristics on ice adhesion strength for three erosion-resistant materials. The materials tested were titanium grade 2, titanium aluminum nitride coated on titanium grade 2, and titanium nitride coated on titanium grade 2. The surface roughness of the material contributed to the ice adhesion strength but did not explain the variation in ice adhesion strength for materials at similar surface roughness values. To compare the materials, the ice adhesion strength was divided by the environmental temperature to allow for the comparison of ice adhesion measured at varying temperature conditions. The new quantity was called temperature-adjusted adhesion strength. When the surface roughness of the titanium grade 2 substrate increased from 26.4 to , the temperature-adjusted adhesion strength increased 29%. The titanium nitride temperature-adjusted adhesion strength increased 63% when the surface roughness increased from 23.2 to , and the titanium aluminum nitride temperature-adjusted adhesion strength increased by a factor of four. At the lowest surface roughness values tested, the temperature-adjusted adhesion strength of titanium nitride was 31% higher than the uncoated titanium grade 2 substrate, and the titanium aluminum nitride was 40% lower than the uncoated titanium grade 2. The temperature-adjusted adhesion strength of the coatings was 58% higher than the uncoated substrate across the three surface roughness values. Mechanical clamping was determined to be the primary mechanism for ice adhesion strength. Macrostructures with “cliff”-like structures, observed on the coatings via scanning electron microscope visualization, increased the ice adhesion strength over what would be predicted from a surface roughness characterization. These structures also explained the 40% increase in ice adhesion strength of a material subjected to oxidation.",53,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053147,"A new formulation for corotational nonlinear dynamic analysis of thin-shell structures involving large displacements and finite rotations has been presented in this paper. By introducing the kinematic description of the geometrically exact quasi-static shell model to describe the motion of an arbitrary material point in a triangular shell element, the new expressions for the inertial force vector and tangent inertia matrix were derived systematically. The elastic deformation was handled by using the consistent symmetrizable equilibrated corotational formulation, which is independent with respect to the local finite element modeling. An energy-momentum-conserving algorithm and an energy-decaying/momentum-conserving algorithm were developed for nonlinear dynamic analysis by applying the generalized energy-momentum method in the corotational formulation. Three classic numerical examples, including the dynamic response, free motion, and dynamic buckling of thin-shell structures, were computed to verify the accuracy and capability of the presented formulation for solving the nonlinear dynamic problems of thin-shell structures with finite rotations. In the relevant numerical example, the conservations of linear momentum and angular momentum of a shell structure due to the time-integration algorithms in the corotational formulation were investigated.",53,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053216,"The objective of the present study was the development/testing of a novel hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation methodology for predicting the flow at the compressor/combustor interface of a gas turbine engine. The coupling between the flow through the outlet guide vanes and the downstream combustor prediffuser represents the first key component of this interface. Important flow characteristics include three-dimensional turbulent outlet guide-vane wakes, end-wall boundary layers, and both favorable and adverse pressure gradient effects. There is a risk of flow separation if diffuser length and area ratio are not appropriately chosen; alternatively, a significant opportunity exists to reduce system flow losses if this risk is managed properly. Outlet guide-vane/prediffuser flow thus represents a significant modeling challenge. In the present approach to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation computational fluid dynamics, the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver is applied to the (attached) outlet guide-vane flow and the large-eddy simulation solver to the (close to separation) prediffuser. Interfacing a large-eddy simulation prediction with an upstream Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes prediction introduces the problem of generating a spatially and temporally correlated unsteady velocity field for large-eddy simulation inlet conditions, which is also consistent with the time-averaged Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solution. A new Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation coupling procedure has been developed. Experimental data for conventional and advanced outlet guide vane/prediffuser geometries are used to assess the success of the new coupled approach. The results show that the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation approach is able to provide a good balance of predictive capability, improving prediction of velocity profiles at prediffuser exit compared to Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes only solution, and computational cost; it offers an attractive option for outlet guide-vane/prediffuser flow prediction.",53,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053215,"Local linear stability is often invoked in computational aeroacoustics to predict Mach wave radiation or to prescribe inflow conditions in order to drive turbulent transition in large-eddy simulations. In this work, the governing equations are reformulated for the nonoscillatory part of eigenfunctions. Boundary conditions can thus be explicitly enforced and, moreover, the numerical cost is drastically reduced regardless of the method chosen to solve this problem. An efficient method based on a matrix formulation is proposed in this study. One single, small collocation domain is used, even for computing the stability of supersonic flows. Vortical and acoustic instability waves of supersonic plane jets are briefly revisited to demonstrate the efficiency of this new approach.",53,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053219,"Traditional installations of turbofan intake liners include acoustically “hard” axial splices between liner segments for ease of fabrication and assembly. The splices scatter energy from strong rotor-locked tones into adjacent azimuthal orders for which the liner is less effective, thereby degrading the liner performance. The significance of this “splice effect” has led to the adoption of “zero-splice” liners in recent turbofan nacelles. However, damage can occur to such liners in service, and the extent to which local liner repairs reduce the effectiveness of the zero-splice design then becomes an issue. In the current paper, the acoustic effect of damage and repair in a zero-splice liner is simulated numerically. The effects of the extent and the location of a hard patch, representing the liner damage and repair, on the overall performance of the liner are predicted. A close agreement is demonstrated with results from an asymptotic analytical model valid for small patch widths. An approximate method is also described to account for the effect of the nonlinear propagation on linear predictions of the liner performance when repairs are present.",53,3

16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053241,"The maximum safe speed of a helicopter carrying an underslung load is frequently limited due to load instability problems. Rear-mounted fins were previously demonstrated as an efficient means for stabilization of a problematic load. Past stability analyses of fin-stabilized loads were achieved mainly through the use of classic linearized small-perturbation techniques and simplified aerodynamic models. The nonlinear nature of the system dynamics was overlooked during most analyses, thus leading to an incomplete description of its main characteristics. The present paper describes the theoretical prediction of the nonlinear dynamical characteristics of a boxlike underslung load, passively stabilized by rear-mounted fins. Predictions are shown to compare favorably with dynamic wind-tunnel test data both qualitatively and quantitatively. The nonlinear nature of the dynamic system is first demonstrated using time-history data from test results and simulation predictions for specific airspeeds. Bifurcation and continuation analysis is then performed to provide a more complete description of system stability at the airspeed range of interest. It is shown that, although the fins are successful in stabilizing the load motions above threshold airspeed, significant instabilities may still reappear at higher airspeeds. Therefore, dynamic tests should be continued beyond the first indication of load stability. The developed simulation tool allows a broader understanding of the inherently nonlinear behavior of the system’s dynamics and can be used for the study of the combined helicopter–slung-load dynamics.",53,3

The model herein combines the Speziale–Sarkar–Gatski pressure–strain model with the Launder–Reece–Rodi model toward the wall, where the length scale is supplied by Menter’s baseline equation. The model from Jakirlić and Hanjalić has been particularly designed for representing the correct near-wall behavior of turbulence and has been adapted to aeronautical needs. Its length scale is provided by a transport equation for the homogeneous part of the dissipation rate. The models are applied to a series of test cases relevant to aeronautics, showing improved predictions compared to eddy-viscosity models particularly in case of axial vortices.",53,3

19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053455,"The solution of linear flutter equations carries the risk of missing important aeroelastic modes, particularly with large, complex models or control systems. A mathematical technique known as the topological degree of a system of nonlinear equations tells how many roots the equations have within a given region. Using the degree to determine the number of roots of the flutter determinant, regions, such as a velocity–frequency interval, can be tested for missed neutral-stability points. A generalized-bisection technique, together with the topological degree, provides a globally convergent nonlinear-equation solver requiring only function values. Applied to flutter equations, it is a safe way to narrow regions containing neutral-stability points or start points for aeroelastic mode-tracking processes in preparation for more efficient techniques, such as Newton’s method.",53,3

In this paper, a novel noncontact method combining the fringe transmission technique with the liquid-level reflection technique has been developed to accurately evaluate such behavior. To do this, a printed fringe pattern was first placed underneath a transparent test tank with fabricated calibration tails on the wall and, when viewed from above with a high-speed camera, a series of distorted transmission-fringe images with reflected images of the liquid level at different times during the sloshing process were achieved. Combing the quantitative relationship between the shape of the liquid surface and the distortion of the transmission fringes, as well as considering the height curves of the liquid level, the three-dimensional dynamic deformation field could be calculated using multidirectional Newton iterative algorithms. Both the dynamic deformation field of the liquid surface and the residual liquid volume in the tank could be accurately measured at the same time. An experimental verification was carried out, and the results obtained demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of this new method.",53,3
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053522,"The aspect ratio of a membrane wing at moderate Reynolds number affects aerodynamic performance as well as membrane deformations. Wind-tunnel experiments are conducted using three different low-aspect-ratio wings (aspect ratios of 1, 1.5, and 2). Aerodynamic performance is determined from force and moment measurements, which are performed using a six-component force transducer. Membrane deformations are obtained using photogrammetry. Mean values and unsteady effects are examined for both aerodynamic performance and membrane deformations. Mean deflection results indicate that lower-aspect-ratio membrane wings show defined U-shape deflections along the span, whereas higher aspect ratios display a progressive rise in deformation to the wing tip. Dominant chordwise vibration modes of the membrane and their spectral content show that lower aspect ratios exhibit higher mode shapes and frequencies, likely caused by increased downwash, which delays the influence of vortex shedding into higher incidences. The frequencies of the dominant modes in membrane motions are found to correlate with the frequencies of lift and drag fluctuations.",53,3
