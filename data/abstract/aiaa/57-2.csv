Equivalence ratios and ozone concentration are varied to understand the thermal and kinetic impacts, respectively, on DDT transition. The addition of ozone is found to drastically reduce the DDT time and onset distance via kinetic enhancement. The results show that, with a small amount of ozone addition, the DDT time is reduced by up to 77.5%; whereas it only slightly increases the Chapman–Jouguet velocities by 6.7%. Moreover, the addition of 1% ozone extends the DDT limit from equivalence ratios of 0.3 to 0.2. Furthermore, it is observed that ozone addition has a much larger effect on DDT time than the increase of the equivalence ratio. The present results suggest that, for accelerating DDT, the kinetic effect via ozone addition is much greater than the thermal effect. By using the ozone dissociation chemistry with an acetylene kinetic model (HP-Mech), the kinetic effect of ozone on DDT acceleration is examined. The present finding provides new insight into controlling engine knocking and detonation transition in detonation engines.",57,2

To relieve the curse of the dimensionality, a novel flowfield reconstruction method based on an artificial neural network is proposed. The idea is to design a simplified problem that is related to the target problem. Then, the map from the simplified problem to the target problem is built using an artificial neural network. Finally, the target problem can be predicted efficiently through solving the simplified problem instead. Examples of the efficiency of this approach include two-dimensional viscous nozzle flows, an inviscid M6 wing flow, a viscous hypersonic flow of a complex configuration, and an unsteady two-dimensional Riemann problem to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A Gaussian process model is also incorporated for a comparative study. With an artificial neural network of moderate complexity, the solution of the target problem can be generated with good accuracy. Among other observations, it is found that shocks can be predicted well with sharp resolution for steady and unsteady cases. Overall, using a simplified problem that accounts for all the interested parameters as inputs tends to be more reliable than using input parameters.",57,2

Both the single vortex (SNV) and co-rotating vortex pair (CVP) were generated by using NACA0012 vortex generators to simulate the main flow features behind one side of the wings at the farfield and near field. The ground effect was achieved by allocating a flat plate downstream of the vortex generators. It has been found that the lower initial vortex height led to greater vortex rebound and lateral drift in both the SNV and CVP cases, whereas the development of a secondary vortex was also promoted with lower initial vortex height. In the CVP cases, the mutual rotation of the primary vortices led to variation of the close-to-wall velocity distribution. This effect added the disturbances to the formation and evolution of the secondary vortical structure, which eventually affected the height of the secondary vorticity and the rebound of the primary vortices.",57,2

Compared with the conventional boundary element method, the equivalent source method has inherent advantages in avoiding the problems of singularity and nonuniqueness of the solution. However, the equivalent source method can form an ill-conditioned matrix for some specific cases, such as thin scattering surfaces, resulting in serious computational errors in these situations. In this paper, an improved equivalent source method is developed in which an efficient regularization method is proposed to reduce the condition number of the coefficient matrix and the regularization parameter can be easily determined. Numerical test cases validate that the improved method usually can reach a satisfactory computational accuracy for predicting sound scattered by thin structures.",57,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057463,A linear elasticity mesh movement algorithm is presented for unstructured computational aerodynamic meshes consisting of multiple element types. An adaptive method for incrementally stiffening mesh elements is proposed based on mesh element quality. Mesh element quality is defined as the condition number of the coordinate mapping from the element at the previous increment to the current increment. This definition is adopted because it is applicable to elements of arbitrary shape or size. Augmenting the linear elasticity algorithm with this quality metric is demonstrated to improve the success rate of an implicit flow solver on the moved mesh for two practical three-dimensional test cases of industrial relevance and scale.,57,2

(“A Stochastic Perturbation Method to Generate Inflow Turbulence in Large-Eddy Simulation Models: Application to Neutrally Stratified Atmospheric Boundary Layers,” Physics of Fluids, Vol. 27, No. 3, 2015, Paper 035102). In the present adaptation of the original idea, colored noise is generated in the temperature field by adding white noise as source term perturbations in the filtered form of the temperature transport equation. Perturbation boxes introduced within a buffer zone near the inlet encompass multiple computational cells to induce a volumetric buoyancy effect. The amplitudes of the source term perturbations are determined by assigning a bulk Richardson number based on the size of the perturbation box and the height-dependent velocity profile. The temperature field with colored noise is then coupled to the incompressible flowfield within a buffer zone only via the Boussinesq approximation. A turbulent-channel flow and a backward-facing step with a spatially evolving boundary layer upstream of the step are simulated to assess the predictive performance of the inflow generation technique. The results are in good agreement with direct numerical simulation benchmark data, both for the first- and second-order statistics of turbulence. It is also found that the same set of parameters works well in both cases studied.",57,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057329,"Rapid turbulence approximation on and around a vehicle is necessary for development of improved flight simulators for helicopters and aircraft, used both for pilot training and for video-gaming applications. Predictions of synthetic turbulence methods must have both temporally and spatially accurate statistics compared to actual turbulence for the given turbulence mean velocity and Reynolds stress tensor. The stochastic vortex structure (SVS) method was recently proposed for turbulent flows with interacting particles and was shown to generate accurate statistical measures for homogeneous turbulence and for turbulent shear flows. Because the velocity in flight simulators is required only on target points near the flight vehicle, the current paper modifies the SVS method by 1) moving and rotating the vortex structures via stochastic differential equations, and 2) introducing vortices only in a restricted vortex region surrounding the aircraft. This local stochastic vortex structure (LSVS) method decreases the SVS computational speed by several orders of magnitude, making it feasible for real-time turbulence computation in flight simulators. The proposed method is validated by comparing results for different statistical measures with predictions from direct numerical simulation of homogeneous turbulence. Sensitivity of the different measures with numerical parameters in the LSVS model is examined.",57,2

The transitional model, based on integral boundary-layer parameters and transition criteria, introduces streamwise-variable weighting of the production terms in the equations and delay of the shear-stress-limiter activation. Calibration to fit available DNS data yields satisfactory results for a flat-plate reference case, for both skin-friction and velocity profiles. It is shown that the model can be adapted to different variants by appropriate calibration of coefficients. The model is then validated for two airfoil test cases, for both very low and higher Reynolds numbers, a NACA 0012 airfoil at chord-based Reynolds number and angle-of-attack and an S809 airfoil at and . For both application cases, comparison with available data is satisfactory.",57,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057398,"The potentially favorable interaction of a propeller slipstream with a wingtip is a complex problem, because of the importance of vortex interaction and viscous effects. This paper examines the capability of different propeller modeling methods in a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solver for the simulation of wingtip-mounted propellers. The applicability of actuator-disk and actuator-line models to reduce the cost of propeller modeling is investigated in its most accurate form, by applying propeller-blade-loading results extracted from simulations, in which the blades are fully resolved. The numerical results are validated by comparison with measurement data from in-house wind-tunnel experiments. It is concluded that the aerodynamic interactions for the wingtip-mounted propeller in tractor configuration can be predicted by RANS simulations with a simple one-equation turbulence model (Spalart–Allmaras), provided that the uncertainty due to numerical diffusion is accounted for by a grid-dependency study, or reduced by local grid refinement. The actuator-line model reduced the computational time by 17% without introducing errors into the time-accurate and time-averaged wing loading. The actuator-disk model reduces the computational cost by 85% by removing time dependency, with a small penalty in the accuracy of the time-averaged flowfield and a 3.9% overprediction of the wing lift.",57,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057129,"Airfoils are of great importance in aerodynamic design, and various tools have been developed to evaluate and optimize their performance. Existing tools are usually either accurate or efficient, but not both. This paper presents a tool that can analyze airfoils in both subsonic and transonic regimes in about one-hundredth of a second, and optimize airfoil shapes in a few seconds. Camber and thickness mode shapes derived from over 1000 existing airfoils are used to parameterize the airfoil shape, which reduces the number of design variables. More than 100,000 Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) evaluations associated with different airfoils and flow conditions are used to train a surrogate model that combines gradient-enhanced kriging, partial least squares, and mixture of experts. These surrogate models provide fast aerodynamic analysis and gradient computation, which are coupled with a gradient-based optimizer to perform rapid airfoil shape design optimization. When comparing the surrogate-based optimization with optimization based on direct RANS evaluations, the largest differences in minimum are 0.04 counts for subsonic cases and 2.5 counts for transonic cases. This approach opens the door for interactive airfoil analysis and design optimization using any modern computer or mobile device.",57,2

In this contribution, fully resolved direct numerical simulations of Dassault Aviation’s V2C profile at transonic conditions and a Reynolds number of half a million are presented. Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities appear in the shear layers on the pressure and suction sides, followed by a self-sustained laminar–turbulent transition process promoted by the stretching of rib vortices between larger corotating structures. Multiple acoustic structures interacting with the boundary layer are also observed, together with upstream-propagating shock waves. Regions of flow separation on the suction side exhibit unsteadiness with Strouhal numbers in the range of . This is distinct from a standing wave oscillation in lift at , which agrees well with transonic buffet frequencies reported for experiments on the same airfoil at higher Reynolds numbers. The insensitivity of the principal results to the chosen grid resolution and spanwise domain size is carefully established.",57,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057266,Measurements of the lift coefficient history obtained from a NACA 0018 airfoil undergoing pitching maneuvers with blowing-type active flow control were used to obtain low-dimensional models for control. Disturbance models for the lift response to pitching at different steady-state blowing amplitudes were identified based on a variation of the Goman–Khrabrov model. A plant model for the lift response to sinusoidal blowing amplitude had the form of a time-delay system. The models were used to design a feed-forward controller. The ability of the controller to compensate for lift oscillations during pitching maneuvers was evaluated using a Simulink® model.,57,2

Following risk-reduction airfoil experiments, full-scale experiments were performed on an unswept tapered V-tail panel at typical takeoff speeds . Using less than 10 W of input power, significant poststall lift coefficient improvements (up to 0.6 or 100%) were observed, actuation was effective to , bistable behavior (hysteresis) was eliminated, and a mild sensitivity to pulsation frequency and duty cycle was observed. Takeoff performance calculations indicated a 30 m reduction in ground roll and a 65% increase in allowable crosswind speeds. The physical system proved to be robust in that the silicone rubber dielectric material did not oxidize or degrade during several hundred hours of continuous operation. In summary, pulsed DBD plasma proved to be a viable and practical solution to the problem of flow separation from the panels during crosswind takeoff. Before flight tests, future wind-tunnel experiments will employ high-thrust, fully-integrated actuators operable on both surfaces of the panels, and the effect of mild sweep, encountered during takeoff and landing, will be investigated.",57,2

The effect of an array of static cylinders, placed just upstream of a deflected control surface, on the separated flow over the control surface was explored via surface pressure and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements. The array of pins was embedded in a turbulent boundary layer, where the height of the pins was approximately 2/3 of the local boundary-layer thickness. The static array of pins demonstrated a large reduction of the separated flow over the control surface, as well as a change in the global circulation, quantified by an enhanced sectional lift coefficient of and reduction in drag coefficient of . A secondary dataset was collected, which studied the effect imposed on the nearfield from a single pin that was either static or underwent dynamic motion (in the wall-normal direction), placed upstream of the deflected control surface hinge line. Results indicate that even a single pin (with diameter-to-airfoil span ratio of ) had a noticeable impact on the delay of separation, enhanced global circulation, and drag reduction. Overall, the features discussed have provided strong evidence of the potential that finite-span, low-aspect-ratio cylindrical pins provide as new actuators for flow control.",57,2

Significant improvements have been made to previous flight experiments in order to more reliably determine and control the model angle of attack and unit Reynolds number in order to minimize the uncertainties that DREs have on laminar–turbulent transition on a swept wing. Two interchangeable leading-edge surface-roughness configurations were tested: highly polished and painted. The baseline transition location for the painted leading edge (increased surface roughness) was unexpectedly farther aft than the polished. Infrared thermography, coupled with a postprocessing code, was used to globally extract a quantitative boundary-layer transition location. Linear stability guided the DRE configuration test matrix. Although the results have not reliably confirmed the use of DREs as a viable laminar flow control technique in the flight environment, it has become clear that significant computational studies, specifically direct numerical simulation of these particular DRE configurations on this model geometry and flight conditions, are a necessity in order to better understand the influence that DREs have on laminar–turbulent transition",57,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056826,"Thermal perturbations initiated by pulsed plasmas and lasers have demonstrated impressive control authority in various high-speed turbulent shear flows, yet questions on fundamental physics and amplitude scaling remain unanswered. The control mechanism is believed to stem from thermal energy deposition (Joule heating), and there is a vital difference in the flow receptivity to these perturbations in comparison to more traditional momentum-based devices employed for active flow control. This paper provides a chronological description of the author’s research on energy deposition-based flow control actuators with specific focus on surface plasma discharges. Early demonstrations of both success and failure for boundary-layer separation control are reviewed and assessed with the benefit of hindsight. This sets the stage for more recent investigations of flow physics and scaling in both free and reattaching incompressible turbulent shear layers. The majority of the presented results are taken from experiments by the author employing nanosecond-pulse-driven dielectric barrier discharge (NS-DBD) plasma actuators, although laser energy deposition is included for context. A general review of NS-DBD plasma actuators for active flow control is also provided. The paper is presented in a manner that conveys the thinking of the author and the wider community at the time of investigation.",57,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057065,"The relative phase of oscillating jets from a pair of fluidic oscillators was synchronized in this work. The means for this synchronization was mutual interaction through a shared feedback channel between the two oscillators. Flow visualization and hot-wire measurements indicated a strong correlation and phase synchronization between the two oscillators. A numerical analysis offered better understanding of the internal flow physics that led to the synchronization phenomenon. A portion of the output jet from one fluidic oscillator was redirected and crossed over into the adjacent oscillator, leading to momentum transfer between the two oscillators. A portion of this cross-oscillator flow was directed into the shared feedback channel and constituted the main feedback flow. In this process, one of the shared feedback channel outlets was blocked by a vortex, allowing only one oscillator to receive feedback flow. The primary mechanism for in-phase synchronization was the cross-oscillator flow, which was divided into phase-modulated momentum injection to the primary jet and modulated flow input to the shared channel feedback channel.",57,2

Improved delayed detached-eddy simulation is employed as a practical yet high-fidelity turbulence modeling approach to resolve the flow structures inside the oscillator’s passages and in the crossflow region. The predicted flow generated by an oscillator with an outlet hydraulic diameter of 10 mm using air as a working fluid is validated against the particle image velocimetry data for two jet-to-freestream velocity ratios of 1 and 3. Close agreement is observed between the current numerical study and experimental data for the time-averaged and time-resolved flowfields at both velocity ratios. Formation of a pair of counter-rotating streamwise vortices is observed with a growth in its strength and size as the jet velocity increases. A greater penetration of the jet in both normal and lateral directions at higher jet velocity is also seen.,57,2

The deformation characteristics and the control effect of the SMA bump are investigated by both experimental and numerical methods. It is found that the well-trained SMA bump can achieve the desired bump shape automatically. The total root mean square error between the actual SMA plate profile and the designed one is 0.05 times of designed bump’s height without aerodynamic load, whereas the value increases to 0.09 times of designed bump’s height at the end of the wind tunnel test. When the inlet operates at Mach 3.8 the shock-induced large separation is reduced substantially and transformed into two small-scale separation bubbles under the control of the deformable bump. The total pressure recovery of the bump controlled inlet is always higher than the uncontrolled one in the same back pressure ratio during the throttling process. The critical back pressure ratio of the controlled inlet reaches to 28, whereas the corresponding value of the uncontrolled inlet is only 23.",57,2
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057407,"This paper examines experimentally the use of a fluidic spoiler to suppress the resonance within a partially closed cylindrical cavity subject to a grazing flow. The relative movement of aircraft and high-speed land-based vehicles through air often results in structural cavities in these vehicles being subject to shear-layer-driven resonance. This can lead to high-amplitude pressure fluctuations within the cavity volume, causing damage to stores or equipment found within landing-gear wheel or weapon bays, for example, or else significant discomfort to the passengers of cars or trains. This large-scale buffeting can also cause vehicle stability problems and can increase drag. This work presents a novel method, in which passive flow control consisting of an upstream fluidic spoiler is used to redirect the upstream flow so that the cavity orifice is shielded. As a result, the grazing flow can no longer detach from the upstream leading edge of the cavity, and thus, vortex shedding is suppressed. The scope of the study includes an examination of higher-order azimuthal acoustic modes excited in the cylindrical cavity: modes which have received little attention in the literature, but which can be readily excited for many flow configurations for partially covered cavities.",57,2
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057402,"A novel application of fluidic injection was developed to investigate and understand the effects of discrete fluidic injection internal to the jet nozzle. Various injection locations, angles, and conditions were studied, resulting in unique acoustic behavior and flowfield modifications. For most conditions, the acoustics are relatively unaffected or increased, but for very specific conditions, noise was drastically decreased. For optimized conditions, the shock noise was completely eliminated, and in other cases, a jet instability was generated that significantly decreased high-frequency noise. Measurements of the velocity field indicated that shock interaction, due to shocks from the injection jets, interacts with the primary jet shocks and significantly reduces the shock strength, attributing massive shock noise reduction. Validation of the experimental results was achieved with large-eddy simulation, which provided additional insight into the shock suppression due to resolution of the flowfield internal to the nozzle. Optimal injection parameters resulted in reduction of overall sound pressure level of at the upstream and downstream angles simultaneously through a combination of shock disruption and streamwise vorticity introduction. A new mechanism of supersonic jet noise reduction and destructive interference of the shock structure in the jet is reported.",57,2
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057041,"The acoustic analogy provides a general framework for predicting broadband jet noise. The accuracy of the noise predictions is strongly dependent on the second- and fourth-order integral time and length scales of the turbulence quantities in the jet. Two low-order models for the second- and fourth-order integral length scales are examined. The low-order models are defined by locally isotropic scales estimated from two-dimensional particle image velocimetry measurements. These measurements are of screeching underexpanded unheated round jets issuing from a purely converging nozzle at conditions that correspond to ideally expanded Mach numbers of 1.45 and 1.59. The jets are dominated by the helical (C) instability screech mode, which is associated with large-scale coherent periodic fluctuations. These fluctuations are filtered using a proper orthogonal decomposition method to assess low-order models that approximate the length scales associated with the broadband noise mechanisms. The length scale model parameters are shown to be insensitive for the two Mach numbers considered. The root-mean-square error associated with the low-order models indicates that either is sufficient for approximating the integral length scales required to model equivalent sources of broadband jet noise.",57,2
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057374,"Fluid–structure interactions due to intermittent turbulent spots were studied on a 7 deg half-angle cone in the Sandia Hypersonic Wind Tunnel at Mach 5 and 8 and in the Purdue Boeing/U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel. A thin composite panel was integrated into the cone and the response to boundary-layer disturbances was characterized by accelerometers on the backside of the panel. Under quiet flow conditions at Mach 6, the cone boundary layer remained laminar. Artificially generated turbulent spots excited a directionally dependent panel response. When the spot generation frequency matched a structural natural frequency of the panel, resonance would occur, and responses over 200 times greater than under a laminar boundary layer were obtained. At Mach 5 and 8 under noisy flow conditions, natural transition driven by the wind-tunnel acoustic noise dominated the panel response. A single turbulent spot could not change this forced response. However, at higher spot burst rates, an elevated vibrational response was observed during transition at frequencies corresponding to the distribution of turbulent spots in the transitional flow. Once turbulent flow developed, the structural response dropped because the intermittent forcing from the spots no longer drove panel vibration.",57,2

To study the flow interaction between two adjacent inlets, the flowfield in a parallel modular hypersonic inlet model that contains two abreast identical modules at a design point of Mach 6 is studied experimentally. The current study examines the flow interaction between two modules when one module is in a state of unstart. The results indicate that the unstart of module 1 can lead to the unstart of the adjacent module 2, and the accompanying process of disturbance propagation includes four typical stages, known as “double start”, “single start”, “transitional stage”, and “double unstart.” Different from the common unstart mode, which is related to the internal flowfield, the unstart process of module 2 is primarily induced by the external flow disturbance derived from the unstart of the module 1, which represents a novel inducement to the unstart of a hypersonic inlet.",57,2

The test rotor underwent an experimental campaign with independent control of the shaft speed, pressure ratio, and air density levels. Measurements were obtained entirely by means of nonintrusive techniques such as blade tip-timing optical probes, and unsteady pressure transducers located in the outer casing of the rig downstream of the rotor. The bladed rotor was designed to flutter under a wide range of operating conditions. The independent effects of the shaft speed and the air density level were thoroughly investigated. It was concluded that, first, the higher the density level, the higher the level of instability and, second, that the vibration amplitude of the rotor blade exhibits a maximum with the shaft speed. In addition, the rotor blades were designed in such a way that additional masses could be mounted in the tip-shrouds to create arbitrary mistuning patterns. Two different mistuning patterns were tested: the first consisted of a classical alternate mistuning pattern designed to suppress flutter, whereas a second pattern was designed to halve the vibration amplitude of the tuned bladed disk. Both objectives were successfully achieved during the experiment.",57,2
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057228,"This study examines the effect of diffuser length variation on the performance of ducted rotors in hover and edgewise flight. The flow over a three-dimensional model of ducted rotor configurations was simulated using a detached-eddy simulation model implemented in a stabilized finite element method. Performance comparisons were made between the different diffuser length configurations, varying from 144 to 18% rotor radius. In edgewise flight, the duct inlet at the front generates high lift, and the rotor generates higher lift over the front as well due to the upwash at the front of the disk. These factors combine to generate a large nose-up pitching moment. Additionally, ducted rotors typically see large drag from ram pressure on the rear diffuser. The short duct completely eliminated the ram-pressure induced H-force on the rear diffuser, significantly reducing the drag of the entire system. Because the ram pressure on the aft diffuser generated a nose-down moment, partially counteracting the nose-up moments from the rotor and duct inlet, its absence in the shortest duct resulted in a net increase in steady nose-up pitching moment. The rotor is the primary source of vertical vibratory forces as well as vibratory pitching moment. The shortest diffuser configuration was shown to significantly reduce the magnitude of the vertical and H-force vibrations, but the magnitude of the vibratory pitching moments increased.",57,2

To isolate the impact of numerical filtering and the associated errors inherently present in implicitly filtered large-eddy simulation approaches, the authors have developed a novel explicit filtering approach suitable for any mesh topology and filter kernel. Simulations of a bluff-body stabilized, premixed flame configuration on a sequence of meshes are used to demonstrate this methodology. Grid convergence assessment is also performed for another approach, wherein the filter width at each computational cell is explicitly set. Comparisons show that solutions from prescribed-width implicitly filtered large-eddy simulation and explicitly filtered large-eddy simulation approaches exhibit good convergence for the mean quantities. The explicitly filtered large-eddy simulation results show clear convergence trends in the rms quantities, unlike the prescribed-width implicitly filtered large-eddy simulation approach and previously reported implicitly filtered large-eddy simulation results. While discrepancies exist in the level of agreement between the grid converged rms solutions with measured data, this could now be attributed to the errors in the physical models and boundary conditions. Importantly, the proposed explicitly filtered large-eddy simulation approach only reduces the computational efficiency by approximately 30% on the fine grid simulation, relative to the implicitly filtered large-eddy simulation approach.",57,2

In the present study, the coupling mechanisms of combustion oscillations in a model combustor are investigated. The oscillation characteristics and dynamic flame structure are studied for better comprehending their intrinsic nature. Current surveys show that inlet parameters, nozzle mounting positions, and fuel supply have important effects on combustion oscillation. The coupling and decoupling boundary composed of the factors mentioned above divides combustion into stable, transition, and instable regions. The effects of the operating conditions on combustion present a certain complexity in terms of studying oscillations. For the model combustor, periodic velocity fluctuation with large amplitudes is regarded as “bridge” that links pressure wave and heat release fluctuation, and it further leads to coupling processing. The acoustic simulation results suggest that the oscillation frequency is in accordance with the acoustic resonance frequency of the exhaust pipes. Finally, to investigate the internal spatiotemporal fluctuation mechanisms of the flame structure, the proper orthogonal decomposition method is used to decompose the dynamic flame structure.

The framework of synchronization is used to analyze the temporal as well as the spatiotemporal behavior of these oscillations. The results of the synchronization transition observed in this combustor are further compared and contrasted with those recently reported by Pawar et al. (“Thermoacoustic Instability as Mutual Synchronization Between the Acoustic Field of the Confinement and Turbulent Reactive Flow,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 827, Sept. 2017, pp. 664–693) and Mondal et al.

A rigorous analysis of the synchronization transition of these oscillations in the frequency domain is also presented. The temporal analysis reveals that the synchronization states and the synchronization transition to thermoacoustic instability of the coupled acoustic pressure and heat release rate fluctuations are similar for both swirl-stabilized and bluff-body stabilized combustors. On the other hand, the spatiotemporal analysis of both the combustors during the state of strongly correlated periodic oscillations shows that, despite the acoustic power production being higher during this state, an increased amount of spatial incoherence is visible in the instantaneous and phase-conditioned phasor field of the reaction zone of the swirl-stabilized combustor as compared to that of the bluff-body stabilized combustor. In short, the present study unifies the synchronization transition of coupled oscillations in these turbulent combustors, wherein the mechanisms behind the onset of thermoacoustic instabilities are apparently different.",57,2

The algorithm used here is a nested optimization, in which the outer level optimizes the rib and skin stiffener layouts with a surrogate-based optimizer, and the inner level sizes all of the components via gradient-based optimization. Two optimizations are performed: one restricted to straight rib and stiffener components only, and the other allowing curved members. A moderate 1.18% structural mass reduction is obtained through the use of curvilinear members. A global sensitivity analysis of the topology variables, with and without the effect of the nested sizing variables, is also presented.",57,2
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057441,"Flexibility-based component mode synthesis (F-CMS) is one of the most popular free-interface component mode synthesis (CMS) methods. In the F-CMS method, localized Lagrange multipliers are employed along the interface boundary as a constraint condition between substructures; thus, it offers various advantages, including the perfect independence of subdomains, the easy treatment of the incompatible interface mesh, and parallelized formulation. However, the use of the Lagrange multipliers requires nonstandard specialized eigenvalue analysis procedures. This, in turn, requires a considerable modification in the standard displacement-based time integrators for transient analysis by using the F-CMS method. In the present study, the localized Lagrange multipliers are condensed by exploiting residual flexibility, and this results in a standard displacement-based reduced-order model. A report is made of the performance of the proposed method as compared to several CMS methods, with favorable features observed for the proposed method.",57,2
