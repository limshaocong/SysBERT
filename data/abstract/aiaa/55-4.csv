0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055361,"This paper provides an overview of the National Jet Fuels Combustion Program led by the Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, and the NASA. The program follows from basic research from the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research and results from the engine-company-led Combustion Rules and Tools program funded by the U.S. Air Force. The overall objective of this fuels program was to develop combustion-related generic test and modeling capabilities that can improve the understanding of the impact of fuel chemical composition and physical properties on combustion, leading to accelerating the approval process of new alternative jet fuels. In this paper, the motivation and objectives for the work, participating universities, gas-turbine-engine companies, other federal agencies, and international partners are described. This paper provides an in-depth discussion on the benefits to the fuels approval process, the rationale in selecting conventional and alternative fuels to study, the referee rig used for fuel testing, and the modeling approaches. High-level results are also briefly discussed, and will be covered in detail in separate university-led papers. Lastly, an Appendix reviewing past programs, events, and workshops that lay the groundwork for this program is also included for reference.",55,4

To optimize the background pattern, a parametric study is performed by using a 10 deg compression ramp calibration flowfield producing a reference density gradient. In conjunction with a multigrid cross-correlation algorithm, the optimized background pattern adheres to three classic particle image velocimetry design rules: 1) interrogation window width four times the expected particle displacement, 2) magnified particle diameter between 2 and 5 pixels, and 3) image density greater than 10. A modified -factor analysis and qualitative observations of the density gradient range resolved suggest an optimal image density of 75 and a magnified particle diameter range of 2–5 pixels. Background-oriented schlieren visualization of the primary shock train element in both aspect ratio ducts shows the strongest density gradients to be located in the refracted shock region between the oblique shock intersection and the primary normal shock. A previous study confirms that this region is characterized by an increasing shock angle and Mach number as it approaches the duct centerline.",55,4

Phosphoric acid was used as electrolyte in the anodization process, and the anodic alumina with pore diameter as large as 160 nm was successfully fabricated. This improved AA-PSP achieved a response with the time constant of . This AA-PSP was applied to interactions of a moving shock wave with a circular cylinder. The results show that the improved AA-PSP can visualize the shock reflections and the shock diffractions with the ever-highest spatial and temporal resolution.",55,4

Thanks to its relative simplicity and promising results, the local-correlation–based transition modeling concept represents a valid way to include transitional effects into practical computational fluid dynamics simulations. However, the model involves coefficients to be tuned to match the required application. In this paper, the -equation transition model is assessed and calibrated, for a wide range of Reynolds numbers at low Mach, as needed for wind turbine applications. Different airfoils are used to evaluate the original model and calibrate it, whereas a large-scale wind turbine blade is employed to show that the calibrated model can lead to reliable solution for complex three-dimensional flows. The calibrated model shows promising results for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows, even if cross-flow instabilities are neglected.",55,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055212,"A method based on the Delaunay graph mapping mesh movement is proposed to eliminate mesh sensitivity, which is required in the discrete adjoint optimization framework. The method makes use of a one-to-one explicit algebraic mapping between the volume and surface mesh nodes, for which the relative volume coefficients based on the Delaunay graph are computed only once. This procedure also results in a straightforward computation of the mesh sensitivity without the need to invert the large sparse matrix generally associated with implicit mesh movements such as the spring analogy, torsional spring, and linear elastic analogy. The advantage of the method comes from the fact that the solution of the second linear mesh adjoint system of equations is no longer required. The method has been verified for the two-dimensional RAE 5243 airfoil and for the three-dimensional ONERA M6 wing for two cases: 1) sensitivities of the objective function with respect to each surface mesh point as a design variable compared with those computed using finite differences, and 2) sensitivities against incidence as a design variable compared with those derived analytically. A comparison of the surface sensitivities with the mesh adjoint method using linear elasticity is also presented.",55,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055107,"Compressible large-eddy simulations combining high-order methods with a wall model have been developed in order to compute wall-bounded flows at high Reynolds numbers. The high-order methods consist of low-dissipation and low-dispersion implicit finite volume schemes for spatial discretization on structured grids. In the first part, the procedure used to apply these schemes in near-wall regions is presented. It is based on a ghost cell reconstruction. Its validity is assessed by performing the large-eddy simulation of a turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of . In the second part, to consider flows at higher Reynolds numbers, a large-eddy simulation approach using a wall model is proposed. The coupling between the wall model and the high-order schemes is described. The performance of the approach is evaluated by simulating a turbulent channel flow at using meshes with grid spacings of , 200, and 300 in the streamwise direction and , 100, and 150 in the wall-normal and spanwise directions (in wall units). The effects of the choice of the point used for data exchange between the wall model and the large-eddy simulation algorithm, as well as of the positions of the ghost cells used for the coupling, are examined by performing additional computations in which these parameters vary. The results are in agreement with direct numerical simulation data. In particular, the turbulent intensities obtained in the logarithmic region of the boundary layers of the channel flow are successfully predicted.",55,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055084,"Experience gained from previous jet noise studies with the unstructured large-eddy simulation flow solver “Charles” is summarized and put to practice for the predictions of supersonic jets issued from a converging–diverging round nozzle. In this work, the nozzle geometry is explicitly included in the computational domain using an unstructured body-fitted mesh. Two different mesh topologies are investigated, with emphasis on grid isotropy in the acoustic source-containing region, either directly or through the use of adaptive refinement, with grid size ranging from 42 to control volumes. Three different operating conditions are considered: isothermal ideally expanded (fully expanded jet Mach number of , temperature of , and Reynolds number of ), heated ideally expanded (, , and ), and heated overexpanded (, , and ). Blind comparisons with the available experimental measurements carried out at the United Technologies Research Center for the same nozzle and operating conditions are presented. The results show good agreement for both the flow and sound fields. In particular, the spectra shape and levels are accurately captured in the simulations for both near-field and far-field noise. In these studies, sound radiation from the jet is computed using an efficient permeable formulation of the Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings equation in the frequency domain. Its parallel implementation is reviewed and parametric studies of the far-field noise predictions are presented. As an additional step toward best practices for jet aeroacoustics with unstructured large-eddy simulations, guidelines and suggestions for the mesh design, numerical setup, and acoustic postprocessing steps are discussed.",55,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055309,"A method is presented for imaging rotating broadband sources with a microphone array. The microphone array rotates virtually with the same angular frequency as the source such that the pressure data are mathematically transformed into a rotating reference frame and the influence of the moving source (Doppler shift) is compensated. In contrast with other works, this method works completely in the frequency domain by using the spherical harmonic series expansion method to calculate a modified free-space Green function in the rotating system. An analytical solution for the sound radiation from the rotating sound source, which considers motion compensation and a uniform subsonic axial flow, is deduced. Simulations on a rotating point source considering axial flow are performed. Measurements with a fan are examined for different frequencies with standard delay and sum beam-forming and high-resolution algorithms.",55,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055295,"The nonlinear response of acoustic resonators is investigated over a broad range of frequencies and amplitudes. Helmholtz resonators with a symmetric neck and an asymmetric neck, respectively, as well as quarter-wave resonators are considered. Describing functions for impedance and the reflection coefficient of a Helmholtz resonator at various sound pressure levels are determined from compressible flow simulation and validated against experimental data. The particular focus of the present study is the nonlinear scattering to higher harmonics. For the Helmholtz resonator with a symmetric neck, a distinct pattern in the amplitudes of the higher harmonics is observed, where the odd harmonics dominate the response, whereas the even harmonics are almost negligible. Such an “odd-harmonics-only” pattern, which was observed previously in an experiment at the orifices, is explained by a quasi-steady analysis based on the Bernoulli equation, assuming a symmetric flow pattern at the neck. For the Helmholtz resonator with an asymmetric neck, it is observed in computational fluid dynamics simulations that even harmonics contribute noticeably to the resonator response, such that the odd-harmonics-only pattern is less pronounced. For the markedly asymmetric geometry of the quarter-wave resonator, the second harmonic is dominant and the odd-harmonics-only pattern vanishes completely. The quasi-steady analysis is extended successfully to also describe nonlinear scattering to higher harmonics for asymmetric configurations and flow patterns. Overall, the scattering to higher harmonics remains on a moderate level, even at very high excitation levels for the Helmholtz resonator configurations. For the quarter-wave resonator, the scattering is more pronounced and contributes perceptibly to the response at high excitation amplitudes.",55,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055248,"Thermoacoustic Helmholtz solvers provide a cheap and efficient way of predicting combustion instabilities. However, because they rely on the inviscid Euler equations at zero Mach number, they cannot properly describe the regions where aerodynamics may interact with acoustic waves, in the vicinity of dilution holes and injectors, for example. A methodology is presented to incorporate the effect of non-purely acoustic mechanisms into a three-dimensional thermoacoustic Helmholtz solver. The zones where these mechanisms are important are modeled as two-port acoustic elements, and the corresponding matrices, which notably contain the dissipative effects due to acoustic–hydrodynamic interactions, are used as internal boundary conditions in the Helmholtz solver. The rest of the flow domain, where dissipation is negligible, is solved by the classical Helmholtz equation. With this method, the changes in eigenfrequency and eigenmode structure introduced by the acoustic–hydrodynamic effects are captured, while keeping the simplicity and efficiency of the Helmholtz solver. The methodology is successfully applied on an academic configuration, first with a simple diaphragm, then with an industrial swirler, with matrices measured from experiments and large-eddy simulation.",55,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055576,"A new attempt to measure the structure response generated by a turbulent boundary layer in a wind tunnel is proposed in this paper. To develop a scaling procedure that accommodates both the structural vibration and turbulent boundary-layer excitation for predicting the vibration response of a structure using a scaled model in a wind tunnel, a receptance method is used to extend the scaling procedure to a curved plate. Because the scaling equations are developed for a simply supported boundary and a clamped boundary, a modal analysis is used to confirm that the scaling equations are also applicable to a plate with unsupported boundary conditions. The characteristic parameters of the structural vibrations and the flow parameters for a full-scale object are both scaled. In addition, the scaling procedures consider the effects of the material used in the scaled model in predicting the vibrations of the full-scale structure. The scaling procedures are developed from theoretical methods, and numerical techniques and wind-tunnel measurements are used to validate the scaling procedures. The structural vibrations of a full-scale body are compared with the results obtained using the scaling procedure and the response of a scaled model to verify that the scaling procedures developed in this study are effective for predicting the structural response of full-scale bodies from wind-tunnel test data.",55,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055186,"This paper presents a numerical study of the transonic flow over a half wing–body configuration representative of a large civil aircraft. The Mach number is close to cruise conditions, whereas the high angle of attack causes strong separation on the suction side of the wing. Results indicate the presence of shock-wave oscillations inducing unsteady loads that can cause serious damage to the aircraft. Transonic shock buffet is found. Based on exploratory simulations using a baseline grid, the region relevant to the phenomenon is identified and mesh adaptation is applied to significantly refine the grid locally. Time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and delayed detached–eddy simulations are then performed on the adapted grid. Both types of simulation reproduce the unsteady flow physics, and much information can be extracted from the results when investigating frequency content, the location of unsteadiness, and its amplitude. Differences and similarities in the computational results are discussed in detail and are also analyzed phenomenally with respect to recent experimental data.",55,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055383,"The impact of increased inflow turbulence on the sound generation in forward- and backward-skewed low-pressure axial fans was investigated using a microphone array method. A turbulence grid was mounted at the inlet section to increase the inflow turbulence intensity. The inflow conditions were then characterized using a laser Doppler anemometer. A beamforming algorithm with deconvolution was applied for localizing sound sources on the fans under free and distorted inflow conditions. Sound spectra and sound maps showed that distorted inflow conditions had a profound impact on the sound emission and that the extent of this was strongly dependent on the fan blade design. In general, sound sources were found on the fan blade surfaces and the fan blade leading edges. After the installation of the turbulence grid, sound sources on the leading edges were amplified, especially in the case of the forward-skewed fan.",55,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055146,"The vortical flow structures generated by the flapping wings of the DelFly II micro air vehicle in hovering flight configuration are investigated using particle image velocimetry. Synchronous force measurements are carried out to establish the relation between the unsteady forces and force generation mechanisms: particularly, the leading-edge vortex and the clap-and-peel motion. The formation of conical leading-edge vortices on both wings is revealed, which occurs rapidly at the start of the outstroke as a result of the wing–wing interaction. The leading-edge vortices of the outstroke interact with those of the instroke, which are shed and, by mutual induction, advect upstream as a vortex pair at the end of previous instroke. The leading-edge vortex pairs induce a strong inflow into the region formed between the upper and lower wings during the peeling phase, resulting in the formation of a low-pressure region. This, together with the leading-edge vortices and a momentum increase formed by the clap, accounts for the generation of relatively higher forces during the outstroke. The cycle-averaged forces are estimated with reasonable accuracy by means of a momentum-based approach using wake velocity information with an average error of 15%.",55,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055221,"Flapping rotary wing, rotating wing, and flapping wing are feasible wing layouts applicable to micro-air-vehicles capable of hovering flight. A numerical study in this paper presents which wing layout can be more efficient in terms of aerodynamic power for the given kinematic and geometric parameters with or without the constraint of vertical force. In the cases under typical conditions, rotating wing layout is the most efficient one when a small vertical force is needed. However, if a much larger vertical force is required, flapping rotary wing is the only wing layout that fulfills the requirements of the two aspects due to its coupling effect. At relatively high Reynolds number , flapping amplitude , and aspect ratio , comparative relationships from the cases under typical conditions among three wing layouts in terms of vertical force and aerodynamic power efficiency are kept unchanged. Nevertheless, at relatively low ), flapping amplitude , or aspect ratio , horizontally flapping wing and flapping rotary wing could achieve higher aerodynamic power efficiency with a larger vertical force. These findings have great significance in guiding us to select an appropriate wing layout based on various design conditions and requirements in primary design phase to ensure efficiency in micro-air-vehicle design.",55,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055144,"In this paper, a low-order state-space adaptation of the unsteady lifting line model has been analytically derived for a wing of finite aspect ratio, suitable for use in real-time control of wake-dependent forces. Each discretization along the span has between 1–6 states to represent the local unsteady wake effects, rather than remembering the entire wake history which unnecessarily complicates controller design. Sinusoidal perturbations to each system degree of freedom are also avoided. Instead, a state-space model is fit to individual indicial functions for each blade element, allowing the downwash and lift distributions over the span to be arbitrary. The wake geometry is assumed to be quasi steady (no roll up) but with fully unsteady vorticity. The model supports time-varying surge (a nonlinear effect), dihedral, heave, sweep, and twist along the span. Cross-coupling terms are explicitly derived. This state-space model is then validated through comparison with an analytic solution for elliptic wings, an unsteady vortex lattice method, and experiments from the literature.",55,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054876,"Operating convergent–divergent nozzles at low pressure ratios can lead to flow separation. Certain nozzle contours are known to produce a discrete acoustical tone under such conditions that are believed to be generated by a phenomenon known as transonic resonance, which involves a standing pressure wave situated between the separation shock and the nozzle exit plane. This paper reports the findings of a dynamic mode decomposition analysis of a perturbed axisymmetric unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation of a nozzle flow known to exhibit this phenomenon. Two cases of different pressure ratios were studied in depth. The results show that the two cases differ in the shape of the standing pressure wave. The lower pressure ratio produces a standing pressure wave, whereas the higher pressure ratio produces a wave. In both cases, dynamic mode decomposition modes that match the standing pressure wave shape were found to be the least damped and the most energetic modes of the modes produced by the dynamic mode decomposition algorithm. The frequency of the mode for the lower pressure ratio matched the experimentally observed transonic tone frequency extraordinarily well, whereas the higher pressure ratio case was in fair agreement. The dynamic mode decomposition algorithm captured the transonic frequency for five additional pressure ratios.",55,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055411,"Cold flow analysis is applied in a canonical scramjet combustor to obtain insights into key physics of the symmetric/asymmetric combustion modes under different equivalence ratios. Systematic experiments have been implemented in a single-expanding duct with backpressure produced by a cylinder at Mach 3. Fine structures of separated flow have been gained by the nanobased planar laser scattering system. High-frequency pressure signals are acquired to study the unsteady behaviors of separation shock. Velocity profiles obtained from particle image velocimetry are validated by numerical simulations. The results indicate that the symmetric backpressure itself can cause asymmetric separation. A steady symmetric separation mode forms when backpressure is relatively low. An unsteady asymmetric separation mode appears when backpressure is high enough. A large separated region always dominates at the expansion wall in the asymmetric separation mode. The asymmetric separation is formed by the increment of boundary-layer thickness and the reduction of turbulence intensity after expansion corner. An interlaced turbulence intensity distribution between the straight and expansion walls accounts for the transition of separation modes under different backpressure. A broadband oscillation of shock foot lies in the asymmetric separation mode, which is evolved from low-frequency unsteadiness in the shock-wave–boundary-layer interaction. Meanwhile, asymmetric backpressure is able to restrain the development of the separated region and forces the separation mode to stay symmetric and steady under high backpressure.",55,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055217,"In an effort to improve the accuracy of current aircraft ice-accretion prediction tools, experimental and analytical studies have been conducted on airfoils roughened by natural ice accretion. Surface roughness introduced by ice accretion and its effect on surface convective heat transfer have been tested and modeled, based on 10 experimental test cases. A novel scaling coefficient relating the Stanton and Reynolds numbers was introduced for heat transfer comparison and modeling in turbulent regime. By coupling the ice roughness and heat transfer models together with LEWICE ice-accretion tool, an improved ice-accretion model has been achieved. Four experimental ice shapes were obtained at the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand laboratory for model validation. The new surface-roughness model had very good agreement in both overall ice shape and ice thickness at the stagnation line (within 5% discrepancy for four experimental cases), whereas LEWICE prediction constantly underestimated the stagnation ice thickness by 30%. The overprediction of ice-horn lengths was also addressed by the proposed model. In one of the glaze-to-rime-regime cases, LEWICE overpredicted the upper and lower horn lengths by 32 and 22%, respectively, whereas the new model prediction resulted in accuracy.",55,4

Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry is employed for the first time to visualize the flowfield at the location of interaction between a propeller and an incoming body wake, as well as to provide experimental data to be used for the power balance method. Besides experimentally quantifying the power conversion method, the results show that one of the main mechanisms responsible for the claimed efficiency enhancement in the experimental setup is due to the utilization of body-wake energy by the wake-ingesting propeller.",55,4
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055122,"Two-dimensional, direct numerical simulations are used to study the impact of active and natural (passive) suction at forward-facing steps on laminar–turbulent transition. Suction is applied through a gap in front of a step that is located in a flat-plate boundary-layer flow without streamwise pressure gradient. A steady base flow is used with a Mach number of 0.6. Subsequently, Tollmien–Schlichting waves are introduced by suction and blowing at the wall, and their growth over the surface imperfection is evaluated by factors. The investigated step heights are in the range of one to two times the local displacement thickness of the smooth flat plate. Both sharp and rounded step corners are investigated. Cases with and without suction are compared with the smooth flat plate without suction based on factors according to the method. Thus, it is shown that suction is capable to compensate or even overcompensate the negative impact of different steps on laminar–turbulent transition. The work concludes with a configuration that allows natural (passive) suction in front of a forward-facing step. Here, a significant reduction of the factor compared to the smooth flat plate without suction is possible. Further estimations indicate that a net drag reduction may be possible as well.",55,4
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055382,"The effect of suction on an airfoil surface at various locations downstream of the leading edge of a thin flat-plate airfoil was studied in a wind tunnel at a low Reynolds number. At poststall angles of attack, substantial lift enhancement and delay of stall can be achieved if a large separation bubble is generated by reattaching the massively separated flow near the trailing edge. The effects of location and volumetric flow rate of suction were investigated by means of force and velocity field measurements. There is an optimal location of suction around , which generates the maximum lift coefficient for suction coefficients less than 3%. When suction is applied closer to the leading edge, it may be possible to reattach the flow for smaller suction coefficients, but the resulting small separation bubble causes smaller lift increase. Large separation bubbles are needed for the maximum time-averaged lift enhancement, however, they exhibit shear layer flapping, intermittent reattachment, and larger lift fluctuations.",55,4
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055268,"Vortex generators are a widely used means of flow control, and predictions of their influence are vital for efficient designs. However, accurate computational fluid dynamics simulations of their effect on the flowfield by means of a body-fitted mesh are computationally expensive. Therefore, the Bender–Anderson–Yagle and jBAY models, which represent the effect of vortex generators on the flow using source terms in the momentum equations, are popular in industry. In this contribution, the ability of the Bender–Anderson–Yagle and jBAY models to provide accurate flowfield results is examined by looking at boundary-layer properties close behind vortex generators. The results are compared with both body-fitted mesh and other source term model Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations of three-dimensional incompressible flows over flat-plate and airfoil geometries. The influence of mesh resolution and the domain of application on the accuracy of the models is shown, and the influence of the source term on the generated flowfield is investigated. The results demonstrate the grid dependence of the models and indicate the presence of model errors. Furthermore, it is found that the total applied force has a larger influence on both the intensity and shape of the created vortex than the distribution of the source term over the cells.",55,4
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054678,"The various separation control mechanisms of burst-mode actuation with a dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator were experimentally investigated in this study. The control of the separated flow around a NACA 0015 airfoil at a Reynolds number of was investigated using a plasma actuator mounted at a distance from the leading edge of 5% of the chord length. A parametric study on the nondimensionalized burst frequency was conducted at three poststall angles of attack and various input voltages using time-averaged pressure measurements and time-resolved particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) results. The measurement results of the trailing edge pressure, which was selected as the index of separation control, indicate that the optimal burst frequency varies with the angle of attack. Several flow fields are discussed in detail in this paper, and two flow control mechanisms were observed: the use of a large-scale vortex and the promotion of turbulent transition. With regard to the first mechanism, the phase-locked PIV results indicate that a vortex structure, the size of which increases with decreasing burst frequency in the experimental range, is shed from the shear layer for each burst actuation. With regard to the second mechanism, time-averaged pressure and PIV measurements reveal that a burst frequency of is able to promote turbulent transition. Among these two mechanisms, at higher angles of attack, the use of a large-scale vortex structure provides better separation control, whereas near the stall angle, the promotion of the turbulent transition provides better separation control.",55,4
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055473,"We present a numerical study of plasma dynamics in a three-electrode sliding nanosecond dielectric barrier discharge flow actuator. A two-dimensional self-consistent plasma model including the effect of detail air plasma chemistry and ultrafast gas heating is used in our studies. When a third electrode is placed downstream of a classical two-electrode nanosecond dialectric barrier discharge actuator and powered by a negative direct-current voltage, a coronalike discharge is formed in its immediately vicinity, which in turn changes the dynamic of the primary streamers propagating from the pulsed electrode. The primary streamer slides and can even extend to the entire interelectrode distance. The potential difference between the third electrode, the positively charged dielectric surface, and the virtual anode formed by the streamer itself is found to be the main reason behind this elongation because of the electric field enhancement at the streamer head. Preionization and charge accumulation from the third electrode also contribute to this behavior. The numerical results also indicate that for high electric fields a negative streamer can be produced at the third electrode that merges with the positive streamer from the pulsed electrode. Consequently, the plasma channel covers the entire interelectrode space. The elongation of the primary streamer leads to an increase of the effective energy release region, which can result in a more efficient flow actuation mechanism.",55,4

The novel electrode configuration involves two sawtooth-shaped electrodes, which are arranged with opposite sawteeth pointing at each other, resulting in a periodic change in the electrode gap. The sawtooth dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator is investigated for the first time for flow separation control. The flow structures generated by this actuator are found to depend on the height and width of the sawtooth. The application of this actuator on the airfoil leading edge leads to a delay in the stall angle of attack by 5 deg and an increase in the maximum lift coefficient by 9%. Under the same power consumption, the conventional dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator with straight-edged electrodes achieves a delay in stall by only 3 deg and an increase in by about 3%. The difference is found to be linked to the fact that the former generates the streamwise wall jet and the near-wall vortices at the tip and in the trough region of the sawtooth electrode, respectively, whereas the latter produces a streamwise wall jet along the straight-edged electrode.",55,4

Recent work has considered the ability to tow steer the composite plies to achieve better performance. Here, the potential wing weight savings of a full-size aeroelastically tailored wing are assessed by optimizing the properties of a three-dimensional finite element model using straight-fiber and tow-steered composites in the skins. One- and two-dimensional thickness and laminate rotation angle variations are considered as design freedoms. The jig shape is updated to maintain a fixed flight shape, and optimization constraints are implemented on the strains and buckling loads due to maneuver and dynamic gust loads, flutter stability, and control effectiveness for different flight conditions. The optimal main fiber direction is rotated forward of the front spar direction in the outer wing, leading to extension-shear coupling in the skins, which increases the washout behavior of the wing. Washout effects shift the lift forces inboard and allow skin thickness reductions, but also lead to reductions in aileron control effectiveness. The optimized tow-steered laminate configurations achieved larger mass reductions than optimized straight-fiber configurations.",55,4

The key concept underlying this approach is to consider a metamaterial as a highly distributed system of continuous vibration absorbers that introduces multiple stop bands in which the response of the global structure is reduced. Multiple modal frequencies of the absorber system may be tuned to match global resonance frequencies and/or excitation frequencies. Using the assumed modes method, a metamaterial system is designed for integration into the honeycomb core of a representative sandwich panel. The metamaterial system is modeled as an effective distributed complex mass density in the global sandwich-panel model. The cores for two sandwich panels are fabricated using three-dimensional printing technology and then characterized statically and dynamically to determine effective elastic properties and natural frequencies of the cores, as well as loss factors of the vibration absorbers. The sandwich panels, constructed by bonding unidirectional carbon-fiber face sheets to both cores, are tested dynamically for two different boundary conditions: cantilevered and free–free. Experimental results confirm that the metamaterial core reduces the peak dynamic response at the natural frequencies of the sandwich panel with reasonably good agreement with model predictions.",55,4

To guarantee the reflector shape precision with acceptable manufacturing and assembly tolerances, mesh reflectors are designed with special shape adjustment mechanisms, namely, the length of some cables can be carefully adjusted when the reflectors are assembled. Shape adjustment plays a major role in achieving perfect reflector shape precision. In this paper, a robust method is proposed for shape adjustment of mesh reflectors with the consideration of the discrepancy between the mechanical behaviors of numerical models and actual reflectors. In this method, the measured nodal position in each shape adjustment iteration is also employed to update the numerical model so that this discrepancy is gradually decreased. A robust approach is used to determine the cable length change for the model updating and shape adjustment where the adverse effects of the discrepancy can be reduced. Numerical examples and experiments validate the proposed method.",55,4
