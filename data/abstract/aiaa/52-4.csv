1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052375,"The use of metamodeling techniques in the design and analysis of computer experiments has progressed remarkably in the past 25 years, but how far has the field really come? This is the question addressed in this paper, namely, the extent to which the use of metamodeling techniques in multidisciplinary design optimization have evolved in the 25 years since the seminal paper on design and analysis of computer experiments by Sacks et al. ( “ Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments ,” Statistical Science , Vol.  4 , No.  4 , 1989 , pp.  409 – 435 ). Rather than a technical review of the entire body of metamodeling literature, the focus is on the evolution and motivation for advancements in metamodeling with some discussion on the research itself; not surprisingly, much of the current research motivation is the same as it was in the past. Based on current research thrusts in the field, multifidelity approximations and ensembles (i.e., sets) of metamodels, as well as the availability of metamodels within commercial software, are emphasized. Design space exploration and visualization via metamodels are also presented as they rely heavily on metamodels for rapid design evaluations during exploration. The closing remarks offer insight into future research directions, mostly motivated by the need for new capabilities and the ability to handle more complex simulations.",52,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052182,"Dynamic engineering systems are playing an increasingly important role in society, especially as active and autonomous dynamic systems become more mature and prevalent across a variety of domains. Successful design of complex dynamic systems requires multidisciplinary analysis and design techniques. While multidisciplinary design optimization has been used successfully for the development of many dynamic systems, the established multidisciplinary design optimization formulations were developed around fundamentally static system models. General multidisciplinary design optimization approaches that address the specific needs of dynamic system design are still lacking. In this article, the use of multidisciplinary design optimization for dynamic system design is reviewed, associated challenges are identified, related efforts such as optimal control are discussed, and a vision for fully integrated design approaches is presented. Finally, a set of exciting new directions that provide an opportunity for fundamental work in multidisciplinary design optimization is laid out.",52,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052161,"This paper outlines an architecture for simultaneous analysis, robustness, and reliability calculations in aircraft wing design optimization. Robust design optimization and reliability-based design optimization are unified in a mixed formulation, which streamlines the setup of optimization problems and aims at preventing foreseeable implementation issues in uncertainty-based design while ensuring that the performance hit of robustness/reliability assessments is kept to a minimum. To avoid the extra computation time that would be the result of a direct evaluation approach to nondeterministic optimization, Kriging surrogate models are employed, and an alternative implementation of the reliability subproblem is also proposed. The sigma point method is used to compute statistical moments in the robust objective function. The computational effort of reliability analysis is further reduced through the implementation of a coordinate change in the respective optimization subproblem to solve for the distance from the current iterate to the most probable point of failure. Robustness and reliability-based optimization is tested on both simple analytic problems and more complex wing design problems, across a range of statistical variation, revealing that performance benefits can still be achieved while obeying precise probabilistic constraints.",52,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052181,"Visualization of design spaces is a complex problem that has the potential to provide many benefits. Design spaces can be easily visualized with two or three design variables using a range of methods. However, once a problem exceeds this limit, direct visualization that captures all necessary behaviors becomes difficult. To visualize these higher dimensions, it is necessary to use visual cues such as color, size, and/or symbols to show the added dimensions. The disadvantage to using visual cues is the inability to expand much beyond three dimensions. This research focuses on using contextual self-organizing maps to provide a solution to visualizing high-dimensional design spaces by using the dimensionality-reduction capabilities of self-organizing maps. A visual representation is created by generating a self-organizing map and applying objective function values as the contextual labels. The map is then broken into three different maps containing separate contextual information, namely the mean, minimum, and standard deviations for each node. Qualitative information such as modality, curvature, and areas of interest can be determined from these maps. This information can be used to select and initialize a formal optimization algorithm. A number of unimodal and multimodal optimization functions were solved, after using contextual self-organizing maps to first map the design space, to test whether using contextual self-organizing maps to initialize an optimization algorithm improves performance. Initial points were selected from the generated maps and used in a pheromone particle swarm optimization method as well as a numerical method. Results were then analyzed for improvements and insights.",52,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052833,"Previous work on multidisciplinary optimization of high-speed propeller blades led to the emergence of humpy blades with or without sweep. The present paper is intended to deliver more insight into the potential benefits of such blades by means of a comparative study of four blade designs. These designs differ only in their respective chord distribution and tip sweep. Comparisons are given in terms of aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance for the four designs operating either in identical flow conditions, hence different load, or in identical thrust conditions, hence slightly different flow conditions due to adaptation of the blade angle. The results highlight the potential of humpy designs to reduce noise in cruise conditions with a small loss of efficiency.",52,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052658,Experiments were conducted to measure the heat flux in the vicinity of a three-dimensional protuberance placed on a flat plate facing a hypersonic flow at zero angle of attack. The effects of flow enthalpy and height of the protuberance on the interference heating in its vicinity were studied. Evidence of disturbed flow with highly three-dimensional characteristics and heightened vorticity was observed near the protrusion. A parametric study by changing the deflection angle of the protuberance was also made. Correlations exist in the open literature for enthalpy values lower than . This effort has yielded a new correlation that is valid for enthalpies up to . The Z-type schlieren technique was used to visualize the flow features qualitatively for one of the flow conditions studied.,52,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052599,"Experiments are carried out to investigate the shock train in an isolator model. In one model, the wetted surfaces can be heated up to 1000 K. The tests are performed in a hypersonic shock tunnel facility at Mach 7.7 with varying total temperature. The wall temperature is varied between 300 and 1000 K. The experiments show the influence of the wall temperature on the pressure distribution in the shock train. This effect is not covered by the correlation of Waltrup and Billig. The correlation is expanded with the influence of the wall heat flux to include these effects.",52,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052786,"Separation due to the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction in a supersonic/hypersonic inlet always brings negative effects on its performance. A new control method of the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction based on a two-dimensional bump is brought forward and investigated by both experimental and computational methods. First, the uncontrolled case is studied. The flow turning angle of the incident shock is 12 deg, and the freestream Mach number is 3.5. The results show that the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction generates complex three-dimensional flow structures with significant swirling nature, which will substantially deteriorate the performance of a supersonic/hypersonic inlet. Then, the controlled case demonstrates that the shock-induced flow separation can be effectively reduced by the coupling of the precompression effect and the acceleration effect of the bump with a height of 0.33 times of the boundary-layer thickness. In addition, the efficiency of the control method for different shock-impingement positions is obtained, indicating that the separation can be well controlled when the shock impinges on the convex surface of the bump or the concave surface on the leeward side of the bump.",52,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052612,"Mach wave radiation and crackle are dominant noise components from high-speed jets, found in both high-power engines and scale nozzles. The statistics of the pressure signal and its time derivative have been widely studied to identify and quantify crackle. In this paper, we investigate the impact of operating condition on the overall sound pressure level, skewness, and kurtosis of the pressure and signals of a jet issuing from an converging–diverging conical nozzle. The effect of temperature and nonideal expansion were independently investigated. An increase in convective Mach number , achieved by increasing either jet temperature or nozzle pressure ratio, proved to be related to elevated values of overall sound pressure level, skewness, and kurtosis, in both the near and far fields. The peak values of overall sound pressure level, skewness levels, and kurtosis levels were found to propagate at different angles for cold jets, but at elevated temperature, the directivity was more similar. From here, it was concluded that the intense levels of the high-order statistics appear to be generated at different locations in the shear layer of the jet and strengthen away from the jet by nonlinear propagation effects.",52,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052808,"Morphing aircraft concepts require powerful, compact, and lightweight actuators in order to realize the significant changes in the shape and aerodynamics desired. One source of inefficiency and lost performance common to all types of actuators is the mismatch between the force-versus-stroke profile available from the actuator and that required by the load. This work investigates a novel spiral spooling pulley mechanism that allows for kinematic tailoring of the actuator force profile to better match the force required to drive a given load. To show the impact of kinematic tailoring on actuator efficiency, a representative case study is made of a pneumatic artificial muscle-driven morphing camber airfoil employing the fish bone active camber concept. By using an advanced spiral pulley kinematic mechanism, the actuator force profile is successfully tailored to match the morphing actuation torque required, with an additional torque margin added to account for any unmodeled effects. Genetic algorithm optimization is used to select the geometric parameters of the spiral pulley that maximize the energy efficiency of the actuator while ensuring it is able to produce the required torque levels. The performance of the optimized spiral pulley is compared to a baseline case employing an optimized circular pulley, which does not alter the shape of the actuator force profile, to show the performance improvement provided by the kinematic tailoring.",52,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052508,"An experimental and computational investigation of a combination of fluidic injection and chevrons (fluidically enhanced chevrons) for supersonic jet noise reduction was performed. Previous studies have shown that chevrons underperform in overexpanded flow due to reductions in effective penetration. Consequently, this study focuses on improvements gained by fluidic enhancement in the overexpanded regime. Acoustic results indicated the fluidically enhanced chevrons outperform the chevrons, with additional overall sound pressure level reductions of 2 dB in the upstream direction and nearly 1.5 dB in the downstream direction. Spectral results indicated that primary benefits were in shock and low-frequency noise. A small high-frequency penalty was the only observed detriment. Time-averaged velocity and turbulence quantities as well as shock cell spacing, were computed by large-eddy simulation and then compared to particle imaging velocimetry and shadowgraph results. These flowfield measurements indicated that the fluidically enhanced chevrons modify the flowfield by reducing the shock cell spacing and shock strength and increasing the upstream jet half-width, peak and integrated turbulence values, and shear-layer thickness. These modifications were caused by the introduction of streamwise vortices with over four times the magnitude of the unenhanced chevrons. Noise reductions were attributed to flowfield modifications through the use of several theoretical models, such as Powell’s screech formula.",52,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052645,"Active flow control with synthetic jets has been shown to increase aerodynamic efficiency by delaying flow separation. The application of flow control to a vertical tail of an aircraft could enable a significant size reduction of that tail. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on a swept back, tapered tail with a 29.6% chord rudder. Flow control was implemented using eight synthetic jet actuators located just upstream of the hinge line. The mechanism of enhancement was characterized with surface pressure measurements and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. Using flow control, the side force was increased by up to 18% at moderate rudder deflections with actuators operating at dimensionless frequency of . Actuating the synthetic jets with a pulse-modulated waveform yielded superior performance at high rudder deflections. The effect of spanwise spacing was also investigated, as was the relative effect of actuators at different spanwise locations. It was demonstrated that midspan actuators provide the greatest contribution at moderate rudder deflections, and root (inboard) actuators provide the greatest contribution at high rudder deflections; this is due to the fact that the separation propagates from the tip to the root as rudder deflection increases. Moreover, due to the vertical tail sweep, the effect of each actuator is predominantly on a region outboard of its own position.",52,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052680,"High-lift multi-element airfoils, such as those used on large transport aircraft during takeoff and landing, can generate strong adverse pressure gradients that, while the surface flow is attached, can cause off-the-surface separation in the wake: so-called wake bursting. The sudden expansion and thickening of the separated wakes has been shown to decrease lift and increase drag. Wake bursting was experimentally studied over a three-element high-lift airfoil, and unsteady velocity measurements were taken with a split-film probe. The tests were performed in the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign low-speed low-turbulence subsonic wind tunnel on a multi-element airfoil with a chord length of 1.35 ft (0.411 m) and a model span of 2.8 ft (0.85 m). Results for a Reynolds number of indicate that wake bursting was observed for the wake of the main element and the first flap. A methodology was developed to numerically define the core of each wake both upstream and downstream of the burst point. Data show that the local flowfield angle in the wake core does not significantly change relative to the flowfield outside the wake core. Unsteady results indicate that the velocity fluctuations within the burst-wake region are dominated by turbulence in the shear layers between the wakes with less turbulence observed in the wake cores. These turbulent fluctuations were largest in the shear layers and were observed to spread into the wake cores.",52,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052900,"The high-altitude gas balloon is an indispensable tool in atmospheric science, meteorology, and other applications requiring stratospheric observations. A prerequisite of the effectiveness of many types of balloon operations is an accurate trajectory forecasting capability. In particular, targeted flights, sample return missions, or flights of expensive instruments (whose recovery is essential) rely on such models. In this paper, the authors describe a new balloon flight simulation model, which takes into account a range of environmental, physical, and operational uncertainties to generate a predicted trajectory equipped with landing site location error estimates. A key source of error in such models is the incomplete understanding of the drag opposing the rise of balloons in the free atmosphere; here the authors propose a new stochastic drag model based on empirical data derived from thousands of radiosonde flights. Other sources of prediction error are also examined, affecting the accuracy of the flight-path forecast, such as uncertainties in the wind profile and balloon envelope manufacturing variability. The authors show how integrating these elements into a process that generates Monte Carlo ensembles of simulated trajectories has yielded a practically useful flight planning tool, which we have made available to the ballooning community as a free online service.",52,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052689,"Attenuation of self-excited roll oscillations of low-aspect-ratio wings using acoustic excitation was studied in a wind tunnel. For a rectangular flat-plate wing with an aspect ratio of 2, roll oscillations can be completely suppressed, and the onset of the roll oscillations can be delayed with external acoustic excitation. Similar results were also obtained for wings with two different airfoil profiles. Velocity measurements indicated that acoustic excitation could restore a symmetric vortex flow over the free-to-roll wings, thus eliminating the self-excited roll oscillations. The effect of excitation is most noticeable for the side of the wing that sees a larger effective angle of attack due to the rolling motion. Acoustic excitation energizes the shear-layer instabilities and results in reattachment or smaller separated flow region closer to wing surface, thus in turn suppressing the roll oscillations.",52,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052565,"A framework for creating a digital representation of physical structural components is investigated. A model updating scheme used with an artificial neural network to map updating parameters to the error observed between simulated experimental data and an analytical model of a turbine-engine fan blade. The simulated experimental airfoil has as-manufactured geometric deviations from the nominal, design-intent geometry on which the analytical model is based. The manufacturing geometric deviations are reduced through principal component analysis, where the scores of the principal components are the unknown updating parameters. A range of acceptable scores is used to devise a design of computer experiments that provides training and testing data for the neural network. This training data is composed of principal component scores as inputs. The outputs are the calculated errors between the analytical and experimental predictions of modal properties and frequency-response functions. Minimizing these errors will result in an updated analytical model that has predictions closer to the simulated experimental data. This minimization process is done through the use of two multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The goal is to determine if the updating process can identify the principal components used in simulating the experiment data.",52,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052726,"Estimating the functional relation between the probabilistic response of a computational model and the distribution parameters of the model inputs is especially useful for 1) assessing the contribution of the distribution parameters of model inputs to the uncertainty of model output (parametric global sensitivity analysis), and 2) identifying the optimized distribution parameters of model inputs to efficiently and cheaply reduce the uncertainty of model output (parametric optimization). In this paper, the extended Monte Carlo simulation method is developed for this purpose, which provides four benefits to the parametric global sensitivity analysis and parametric optimization problems. First, the extended Monte Carlo simulation method is able to provide an unbiased or progressive unbiased estimate for the model whose behavior is even mainly governed by high nonlinearity or interaction terms. Second, only one set of model input–output samples is needed for implementing the method; thus, the computational burden is free of input dimensionality. Third, the extended Monte Carlo simulation is a derivative-free method. Fourth, the extended Monte Carlo simulation method enables us to solve problems with dependent and non-normally distributed model inputs. Additionally, the R-indices are introduced for conquering the overparameterized problem in the optimization process. An analytical example and two engineering examples are used to demonstrate the power of the proposed methods.",52,4
