1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054555,"A detailed grid-convergence study has been conducted to establish reference solutions corresponding to the one-equation linear eddy-viscosity Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model for two-dimensional turbulent flows around the NACA 0012 airfoil and a flat plate. The study involved the three widely used codes CFL3D (NASA), FUN3D (NASA), and TAU (DLR, The German Aerospace Center), as well as families of uniformly refined structured grids that differed in the grid density patterns. Solutions computed by different codes on different grid families appeared to converge to the same continuous limit but exhibited strikingly different convergence characteristics. The grid resolution in the vicinity of geometric singularities, such as a sharp trailing edge, was found to be the major factor affecting accuracy and convergence of discrete solutions; the effects of this local grid resolution were more prominent than differences in discretization schemes and/or grid elements. The results reported for these relatively simple turbulent flows demonstrated that CFL3D, FUN3D, and TAU solutions were very similar on the finest grids used in the study, but even those grids were not sufficient to conclusively establish an asymptotic convergence order.",54,9
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054545,"Several improvements to the mixed-element USM3D discretization and defect-correction schemes have been made. A new methodology for nonlinear iterations, called the Hierarchical Adaptive Nonlinear Iteration Method, has been developed and implemented. The Hierarchical Adaptive Nonlinear Iteration Method provides two additional hierarchies around a simple and approximate preconditioner of USM3D. The hierarchies are a matrix-free linear solver for the exact linearization of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and a nonlinear control of the solution update. Two variants of the Hierarchical Adaptive Nonlinear Iteration Method are assessed on four benchmark cases, namely, a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate, a bump-in-channel configuration, the NACA 0012 airfoil, and a NASA Common Research Model configuration. The new methodology provides a convergence acceleration factor of 1.4 to 13 over the preconditioner-alone method representing the baseline solver technology.",54,9
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054517,"Output-based high-order adaptive results are presented for several benchmark two-dimensional turbulent-flow simulations. The discretization is a high-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method, and the equations solved are compressible Navier–Stokes, Reynolds-averaged with a modified version of the Spalart–Allmaras one-equation model. Mesh refinement requirements are studied through automated output-based adaptation in which a discrete adjoint solution associated with an output (e.g., the drag coefficient) weights a fine-space residual and automatically selects the elements that need more resolution. The roles of high-order and mesh anisotropy are also investigated. Finally, differences are investigated between two mesh refinement strategies: hanging-node refinement of structured meshes versus metric-based remeshing of unstructured triangles.",54,9
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054558,"An output-based adaptive, higher-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is applied to the solution of standard turbulence modeling test cases drawn from the NASA Turbulence Modeling Resource website, specifically subsonic flow over a flat plate and a NACA 0012 airfoil. Results are presented for the current solver using linear, quadratic, and cubic solution approximations on both structured grids and adapted grids. Comparisons are also made with NASA Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solvers FUN3D and CFL3D. Analysis is presented for the adaptive grids, particularly concerning grid refinement in the vicinity of flowfield singularities for both test cases.",54,9
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054513,"A methodology is presented for characterizing flow solver performance. The methodology can be applied to assess the efficiency of a given approach, where efficiency is defined in terms of accuracy per unit cost measured in central processing unit time. The procedure is presented by demonstrating its application to the parallel Newton–Krylov–Schur finite difference flow solver known as Diablo. The benchmark cases to which the procedure is applied are two-dimensional turbulent flows modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations on three families of NACA 0012 grids with three sets of operating conditions. Performance statistics are presented in a variety of ways that show the relationships between central processing unit time, grid spacing, and accuracy in ways that are informative for both flow solver users and developers.",54,9
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054534,"A traditional second-order accurate finite volume unstructured mesh solver and a high-order discontinuous Galerkin solver are used to simulate turbulent flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. Using a family of standardized high-density grids, mesh-resolved solutions are obtained. The flow is simulated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations closed by the negative Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model. The flow conditions for this case are , , and . Lift, drag, pitching moment, pressure, and skin friction coefficients are provided for multiple grids and discretization orders and are compared against other simulation results from well known solvers. The current simulations give very similar results to these benchmark solvers, pointing toward fully mesh-resolved simulations and providing verification evidence of correct and consistent implementation of these discretizations. Results obtained using the high-order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations show higher accuracy using fewer degrees of freedom compared to the finite volume discretization and the benchmark results. Also, it is shown for the discontinuous Galerkin simulations that refinement converges quicker to the mesh-resolved solutions compared to refinement.",54,9

ONERA proposed new computer-aided design models for the turbulence modeling resources to make ONERA-M6 a reference test case. Results and solver performance are presented and discussed.",54,9
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054508,"A high-order Petrov–Galerkin finite element scheme is used to compute turbulent flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil at a freestream Mach number of 0.15, an angle of attack of 10 deg, and a Reynolds number based on the airfoil chord of 6 million. Results are obtained on a series of grids available on the NASA Turbulence Modeling Resource Web site and are compared with reference solutions that have been obtained using the FUN3D and CFL3D finite volume solvers on meshes with as many as 14.6 million degrees of freedom. Forces, moments, pressure distributions, skin friction, and profiles of velocity and turbulence working variable for the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model are compared between the finite element and the finite volume solutions. It is demonstrated that the finite element scheme shows similar results as the finite volume schemes for most of the comparisons, but demonstrates significantly less dissipation of the wake profiles downstream of the airfoil. It is shown that, when the same number of degrees of freedom is used in the simulations, solutions obtained with quadratic elements are more accurate than those obtained using linear elements with only minor increases in computational cost. Finally, initial results with an adjoint-based hp-adaptive methodology are obtained that further demonstrate that the high-order finite element framework can efficiently yield accurate results.",54,9
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054892,"This paper presents a reduced-order modeling approach based on recurrent local linear neurofuzzy models for predicting generalized aerodynamic forces in the time domain. Regarding aeroelastic applications, the unsteady aerodynamic loads are modeled as a nonlinear function of structural eigenmode-based disturbances. In contrast to established aerodynamic input/output model approaches trained by high-fidelity flow simulations, the Mach number is considered as an additional model input to account for varying freestream conditions. To train the relationship between the input parameters and the corresponding flow-induced forces, the local linear model tree algorithm is adopted in this work. The proposed method is tested exemplarily with respect to the AGARD 445.6 configuration in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flight regimes. It is shown that good conformity is obtained between the reduced-order model results and the respective full-order computational-fluid-dynamics solution. A further comparative analysis in the frequency domain in conjunction with a classical flutter analysis confirms the validity of the approach. Finally, the method’s potential for reducing the computational effort of aeroelastic analyses is demonstrated.",54,9
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054826,"High-order methods have demonstrated their potential in large-eddy simulations of turbulent flows with relatively low Reynolds numbers. The cost becomes a serious limiting factor for high-Reynolds-number problems. A promising approach to reduce the cost of these simulations is the hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation approach. In this paper, a new hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes implicit large-eddy simulation approach for the high-order flux reconstruction/correction procedure via reconstruction method is developed based on a simple algebraic version of the Spalart–Allmaras model in the vicinity of solid walls and an implicit large-eddy simulation approach elsewhere. Despite its simplicity, this approach has demonstrated good performance in simulating turbulent flow at relatively high Reynolds numbers.",54,9
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054628,"In this work, a high-order numerical approach based on the immersed-boundary method to simulate viscous incompressible flows involving arbitrary boundaries is described. The idea is to combine compact finite difference schemes and a high-order direct forcing approach of the sharp-interface immersed-boundary method. In this approach, a particular challenge is to solve the pressure Poisson equation using the compact stencil. This issue is addressed by introducing an efficient approach based on high-order corrections to the right-hand side of the Poisson equation (that is, the source term) while retaining the second-order short stencil for the Laplace operator. The two-dimensional implementation is described, for which third-order global convergence is achieved when an immersed boundary is present.",54,9
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054638,"The time-averaged behavior of gap flow between two stationary side-by-side circular cylinders immersed in the subcritical Reynolds number regime and its variation with gap spacing are presented. A series of experiments and numerical simulations are performed. Results reveal that gap flow, which is the flow passing between the cylinders, can be classified broadly into pressure- and momentum-driven regimes, depending on the spacing ratio , where is the transverse center-to-center spacing between the cylinders and is the cylinder diameter. The pressure-driven regime occurs for roughly , where the mean velocity of the gap flow increases as the spacing ratio increases. The momentum-driven regime follows with a monotonic decrease in the mean velocity as the spacing ratio increases when . Within the pressure-driven regime, subtransitions of the gap flow are further classified, based on distinct changes in the circumferential static pressure distribution, as well as the velocity profile, transverse pressure gradient, and mean velocity at the throat of the two cylinders.",54,9
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053911,"We study the leading edge vortex (LEV) development and LEV circulation of pitch-up wings at a low Reynolds number of 500. Wings of different aspect ratios are linearly pitched up from 0 to 90 deg at two reduced pitch rates of 0.1 and 0.2. The flowfield is described by solving the unsteady three-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations on composite overlapping grids. The -criterion is used to isolate the LEV structure from shear layer. The simulation shows that forces increase with the aspect ratio and the pitch rate. The stall angle increases with the pitch rate but decreases with the aspect ratio. also It is shown that the LEV circulation depends on the wing aspect ratio: increasing wing aspect ratio increases the rate of LEV circulation generation during the pitch-up motion. It also shows that the reduced pitch rate could delay the LEV circulation development. Furthermore, the study shows that the LEV circulation distribution better matches the spanwise force distribution for higher aspect ratio wings.",54,9
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054496,"Flapping flight is commonly seen in nature at low Reynolds numbers. This work investigates the physical aspects of forward flight for flapping unmanned aerial systems. The kinematics discussed in this paper is based on an anticlockwise figure-8-shaped flapping cycle. The evolution of the complex, unsteady vortical flow system that develops during the flapping motion is presented. Mechanisms for generating the lift and thrust are discussed, with emphasis on the unsteadiness of the flow features during both the downstroke and upstroke phases. A one-way fluid–structure interaction has been investigated, and the relative importance of aerodynamic forces is compared with respect to the inertial forces. The inhomogeneity of the wing in terms of mass distribution is studied, and it is shown that a higher density at the wing root is beneficial in respect to the mechanical power required to achieve the forward flight. Limited benefit is observed when higher material density at the leading edge is adopted.",54,9
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054549,"Methods and results are described for flight-test measurements of the aero-optical effect of the near-field flow surrounding a medium-sized helicopter in hover. The data were acquired using a novel, passive measurement approach in which optical wave-front aberrations were computed from the displacements of light-emitting diodes attached to a target array mounted under the helicopter fuselage. The resulting aero-optical data are shown through the rotor downwash and through the engine exhaust of the helicopter, and they are compared to estimates computed using parametric models for the helicopter wake structure and rotor–vortex diffusion. The experimental data provide additional information on the magnitude and frequency content of the aero-optical aberrations, as well as vibration data, that will be valuable for future beam-control and modeling studies.",54,9
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054557,"Proper orthogonal decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition are evaluated for the study of self-excited longitudinal combustion instabilities in laboratory-scaled single-element gas turbine and rocket combustors. Since each proper orthogonal decomposition mode comprises multiple frequencies, specific modes of the pressure and heat release are not related, which makes the analysis more qualitative and less efficient for identifying physical mechanisms. On the other hand, dynamic mode decomposition analysis generates a global frequency spectrum in which each mode corresponds to a specific discrete frequency so that different dynamics can be correlated. In addition, proper orthogonal decomposition results are found to be inaccurate when only a limited amount of spatial information is provided in contrast with dynamic mode decomposition results, which provide more reliable results. Overall, dynamic mode decomposition analysis proves to be a robust and systematic method that can give consistent interpretations of the periodic physics underlying combustion instabilities.",54,9
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054742,"This paper presents the development of a collaborative optimization framework in combination with a variable-complexity modeling technique for the multidisciplinary coupling analysis and design of a shrouded turbine blade. The multidisciplinary optimization design of the shrouded turbine blade involves a high-fidelity detailed computational model and medium-fidelity models, which can become prohibitively expensive. In this investigation, a variable-complexity modeling methodology is introduced, where low-fidelity models and a scaling function are used to approximate the medium- and high-fidelity models through the optimizers in an inner-loop optimization to reduce computational expense. The optimization framework developed includes the collaborative optimization process, parametric modeling of the shrouded turbine blade, fluid–structure interaction solver using arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian formulation, an adaptive hexahedral structure mesh generator by establishing virtual blocks and parametric fixed points, and a variable-complexity modeling method combining the multiplicative and additive corrections to manage three levels of fidelity models. On the shrouded turbine-blade design problem, it achieves a feasible optimizer only calling nine high-fidelity analyses. Response surface model variation and cross-validation tests are performed to verify the predictive power of the response surface model in the multidisciplinary design optimization process of the shrouded turbine blade.",54,9
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054904,"The unsteady flowfields generated by convoluted aeroengine intakes are sources of instabilities that can compromise the performance of the downstream turbomachinery. Hence, there is a need for synchronous high-spatial-resolution measurements that will allow a greater understanding of the aerodynamics. In this work, stereo particle image velocimetry is used in a new application to characterize the distorted flow at the outlet of complex intakes. A suite of measurements and analyses for two S-duct configurations across a range of inlet Mach numbers is presented. The work demonstrates the feasibility of using stereo particle image velocimetry techniques for determining the flowfield at the exit of convoluted intakes with a higher spatial resolution than typical pressure measurements. Analysis of the distortion descriptors quantifies the dependency upon the S-duct configuration and highlights that the more high-offset duct generates greater levels of swirl distortion relative to the low-offset configuration. Distortion maps show that the flow is highly unsteady with a characteristic switching of the swirling flow. The results provide a new dataset that shows that the conventional assessments based on time-averaged data substantially underestimate the swirl distortion level and that the less frequent distortion events give rise to more potentially significant threats to the compression system.",54,9
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054790,"A method for calculating the effective Gol’dberg number for diverging waveforms is presented, which leverages known features of a high-speed jet and its associated sound field. The approach employs a ray tube situated along the Mach wave angle where the sound field is not only most intense, but advances from undergoing cylindrical decay to spherical decay. Unlike other efforts, a “piecewise-spreading regime” model is employed, which yields, separately, effective Gol’dberg numbers for the cylindrically and spherically spreading regions in the far field. The new approach is applied to a plethora of experimental databases, encompassing both laboratory- and full-scale jet noise studies. The findings demonstrate how cumulative nonlinear distortion is expected to form in the acoustic near field of laboratory-scale round jets where pressure amplitudes decay cylindrically; waveform distortion is not expected in the acoustic far field where waveform amplitudes diverge spherically. On the other hand, where full-scale jet studies are concerned, effective Gol’dberg number calculations demonstrate how cumulative waveform distortion is significant in both the cylindrical- and spherical-spreading regimes. The laboratory-scale studies also reveal a pronounced sensitivity to humidity conditions, relative to the full-scale counterpart.",54,9
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054429,"An investigation into a supersonic impinging jet emitted from a truncated plug nozzle is presented for a nozzle pressure ratio of 3.4. High-resolution schlieren and acoustic measurements verify that the jet behavior close to the nozzle is significantly different from round jets. Impingement tones are not observed for plate distances less than 3.2 nozzle diameters from the throat. Sufficiently far downstream from the nozzle, the jet shock structure is similar to that of a round jet. Ultrahigh-speed schlieren is used to track the motion of the standoff shock located above the impingement plate. The shock-oscillation frequency matches the impingement-tone frequency within statistical uncertainty. The average shock standoff distance and oscillation amplitude are related to the relative position of the impingement plate with respect to the shock structure in the equivalent freejet. Shock splitting is directly observed for certain plate distances.",54,9
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054936,"Component mode synthesis is a popular reduced-order modeling technique with a substructuring strategy in structural dynamics. The ideal goal of component mode synthesis is to construct compact reduced models with adequate accuracy for specific intended applications. In this paper, five a priori mode selection methods plus an a posteriori mode selection method have been evaluated as applied to several representative structural dynamics problems to assess their relative merits. The present evaluation offers a guideline for the informed use of these methods, and it is hoped that it will provide a basis for the further development and/or unification of several mode selection methods. Although there is no clear winner for all the problem classes studied, a slight edge of an a posteriori method over the a priori methods is demonstrated for a certain class of problems, provided the analyst is willing to allow extra computational overhead.",54,9
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054080,"Analytical derivation of damping is extremely difficult and in most cases not possible. As a result, damping properties are typically specified on a mode-by-mode basis because of the availability of test data that can be used either directly, or can be used as a guide for similar systems for which data are not yet available. Occasionally there is need to develop from the modal damping properties damping matrices that correspond to the physical coordinate sets in which the finite element model mass and stiffness matrices were developed. Proportional damping, in which combinations of mass and stiffness matrices are used to develop the physical coordinate damping matrix, has been used extensively. It is the purpose of this work to discuss the appropriateness of including a mass proportional term. It is concluded that damping formulations that include a scaled mass term are fundamentally flawed and should not be used.",54,9
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054235,"Longitudinally corrugated shell structure is an appropriate structural element adopted in aerospace, mechanical, naval, nuclear, and weapons engineering. In the present paper, the dynamic expansion of a longitudinally corrugated shell under nonuniform internal pressure with the restriction of outside rigid bodies was studied with an efficient numerical method without element discretization along the circumferential direction. Furthermore, based on the developed numerical methodology, the authors conducted intensive investigations on the geometric parameters of the corrugated shell and revealed a characteristic configuration parameter that governs the expansion dynamics of the longitudinally corrugated shell. In addition, the type (distribution) and rate of the load, which are other important factors that can influence the dynamic behavior of the corrugated shell, are also discussed. The high computational efficiency of the algorithm and the characteristic deformation behavior of the corrugated shell revealed by our analysis make the present method more favorable than commercial software in treating the expansion system in the engineering field.",54,9
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054156,"Dynamic analysis of satellite structures comprises an important part of their design. One such example is an inflatable deployable structure. Although prized for their small volume, mass, and subsequent launch costs, these structures are quite susceptible to disturbances in a space environment that can jitter their mission accuracy. Therefore, it is important to have models to accurately predict their vibrations response to these disturbances. One important aspect to include in these models is the effect of signal and power cables surrounding the host structure that has been traditionally ignored or accounted for using ad hoc models. Obtaining simple analytical solutions that can predict the dynamic behavior of these structures has numerous advantages for their vibrations control and modeling before their launch. Although damping plays an important role in the dynamics of these structures, the presented paper pertains only to the mass and stiffness effects of these cables. The structures are modeled as beam structures harnessed with cables and the governing partial differential equations of motion for different coordinates of vibrations, such as bending, longitudinal, and torsional modes, are derived for the harnessed structure. Two wrapping patterns for the cables are considered. Natural frequencies and the resultant frequency response functions are presented, and the results are compared to a finite element solution.",54,9
