0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051372,"This paper proposes formulations and algorithms for design optimization of multidisciplinary systems under both aleatory uncertainty (i.e., natural or physical variability) and epistemic uncertainty (due to sparse or imprecise information) from the perspective of system robustness. The availability of sparse and interval data regarding input or design random variables introduces uncertainty about their probability distribution type and distribution parameters. A single-loop approach is developed for the design optimization, which does not require any coupled multidisciplinary uncertainty propagation analysis. Thus, the computational complexity and cost involved in estimating the mean and variation of the objective and constraints are greatly reduced. A decoupled approach is used to unnest the robustness-based design from the analysis of nondesign epistemic variables to achieve further computational efficiency. The proposed methods are illustrated for a mathematical problem and a practical engineering problem (fire-detection satellite), where the information on the random inputs is only available as sparse point data and/or interval data.",51,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051556,"Detailed investigation of the NACA is obtained at a Reynolds number of and an angle of attack sweep of via particle image velocimetry and hot-film anemometry. The baseline flow is characterized by four distinct regimes, depending on angle of attack, with each exhibiting unique flow behavior. Active flow control via steady normal blowing is employed at four representative angles; blowing ratio (BR) is optimized by maximizing the lift coefficient with minimal power requirement. Suggestions are made with regard to the flow mechanisms whereby control is effective at each angle. A figure of merit is employed to quantify the efficiency of the actuation. The optimal BRs obtained at Reynolds number equal to are kept constant to observe the scalability of the control with respect to Reynolds number, ranging over nearly two orders of magnitude. It is observed that this approach is nonideal and that the BR should be optimized with Reynolds number as well. The optimization procedure is repeated for two angles of attack at a Reynolds number of . Lift enhancement is maintained while reducing the power requirement, thereby increasing the efficiency of the flow control.",51,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051673,"The leading-edge flow structure of the NACA 0012 airfoil is experimentally investigated under dynamic-stall conditions (; , 22.4 deg; ) using planar particle image velocimetry. The airfoil was dynamically pitched about the one-fourth chord at a reduced frequency, . As expected, on the upstroke, the flow remains attached in the leading-edge region above the static stall angle, whereas during downstroke, the flow remains separated below the static stall angle. A phase-averaging procedure involving triple velocity decomposition in combination with the Hilbert transform enables the entire dynamic-stall process to be visualized in phase space, with the added benefit of the complete phase space composed of numerous wing oscillations. The formation and complex evolution of the leading-edge vortex are observed. This vortex is seen to grow, interact with the surrounding vorticity, detach from the surface, and convect downstream. A statistical analysis coupled with instantaneous realizations results in the modification of the classical dynamic-stall conceptual model, specifically related to the dynamics of the leading-edge vortex.",51,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051898,"A plasma actuator was operated at pressures from 760 to 88 torr to determine the mechanisms leading to decreased force production at low pressures. The actuator was driven with a 5 kHz sine wave and a peak to peak voltage of 13.4 kV. A passive measurement technique called the capacitive V-dot probe was adapted to the actuator to resolve the spatiotemporal evolution of the surface potential and electric field on the dielectric surface. At low pressures up to 20 times more plasma by visual inspection is present than at atmospheric conditions. Average force production is calculated and shown to decrease at lower pressures due to the fact that up to 88% of the plasma is created in regions where the electric field is relatively weak. The calculated average body force shows a slight increase up to a pressure of 429 torr before trending to 0 at lower pressures in good qualitative agreement with experimental force measurements. Performing a power analysis shows that as pressure is decreased more power is used creating plasma rather than accelerating it, leading to a decrease in efficiency.",51,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051864,"An embedded large-eddy-simulation modeling approach is explored and verified using the partially averaged Navier–Stokes model as a platform. With the same base model, the turbulence-resolving large-eddy simulation region is embedded by setting the partially averaged Navier–Stokes model coefficient to as distinguished from its neighboring Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes region, where is specified. The embedded large-eddy simulation approach is verified in computations of a turbulent channel flow and a turbulent flow over a hump. Emphasis is placed on the impact of turbulent conditions at the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation interface using anisotropic velocity fluctuations generated from synthetic turbulence. The effect of the spanwise size of the computational domain is investigated. It is shown that the embedded large-eddy-simulation method based on the partially averaged Navier–Stokes modeling approach is computationally feasible and able to provide reasonable turbulence-resolving predictions in the embedded large-eddy simulation region. The wall-adapting local eddy-viscosity model is also evaluated for the hump flow and it is found that its performance is worse than that of the the low-Reynolds-number partially averaged Navier–Stokes model when the results are compared with experiments.",51,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051907,"Particle-clustering methods have been explored for application to the problem of predicting brownout conditions, which can occur when a rotorcraft operates over surfaces covered with loose sediment and stirs up large dust clouds that impede the pilot’s outward visibility. A significant issue in such simulations is the tracking of the very large number of particles needed to predict with acceptable fidelity the dual-phase flow properties and optical characteristics of the dust clouds. To this end, computationally efficient Lagrangian approaches were explored for the simulation of dilute carrier-particle suspensions at low Reynolds numbers of the relative particle motion. The algorithms examined were the Gaussian method, the k-means method, and Osiptsov’s method, which were all compared in terms of their accuracy versus computational cost against solutions obtained by directly solving for the individual particle motions. Specific results were computed for a prototypical flowfield that mimics the highly unsteady, two-phase vortical particle flow responsible for the development of brownout conditions. It is shown that although clustering algorithms can be problem dependent and have bounds of applicability, in some conditions they offer the potential to significantly reduce the computational costs of brownout dust cloud simulations while still retaining good accuracy.",51,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051945,"A new numerical technique for the stabilization of explicit computational-fluid-dynamic solvers is presented. When using computational-fluid-dynamic codes to solve practical problems one sometimes finds the solution fails to converge due to the presence of a small number of eigenvalues of the flow solver outside the unit circle. In this paper we use the proper orthogonal decomposition technique to estimate the unstable eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the flow solver as the solution diverges for linear problems or exhibits limit-cycle oscillations for nonlinear problems. We use the resulting eigeninformation to construct a preconditioner that repositions the unstable eigenvalues from outside the unit circle to a point inside the unit circle close to the origin resulting in a stable flow solver. In this work the proposed method is applied to a nonlinear steady cascade solver. However, the technique can be easily applied to external flow solvers and to unsteady frequency-domain (time-linearized and harmonic-balance) flow solvers.",51,5
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051943,"The fluid interactions produced by a sonic reaction-control-system thruster are investigated using computational fluid dynamics. The study uses a scaled Mars Science Laboratory aeroshell at a 20 deg angle of attack in Mach 12 flow of -seeded gas. The reaction-control-system jet is directed either parallel or transverse to the freestream flow to examine the effects of the thruster orientation. The results show that both the parallel and transverse reaction-control-system jets obstruct the flow around the aeroshell and impinge on the surface, increasing the overall pressure along the aftbody. As a result, the reaction-control-system jet decreases the drag, lift, and moment acting on the aeroshell, particularly at relatively large reaction-control-system thrust conditions. The results also indicate that the fluid interactions produced by the parallel and transverse jets affect the control effectiveness of the reaction control system. The performance of the parallel reaction-control-system thruster is close to ideal due to relatively small aerodynamic interference induced by the jet. However, the relatively large aerodynamic interference produced by the transverse reaction-control-system jet causes a deficit of control authority. The physical accuracy of the computational method is assessed by comparing the numerical results with experimental visualizations.",51,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051987,"This contribution describes the development and evaluation of a new statistical modeling approach for active vortex generator jets. Previous experiments from the Technische Universität Braunschweig and their subsequent evaluation by the present authors showed that the induced flowfield can be reasonably well represented by two-dimensional Lamb–Oseen vortices. Based on that, an analytical expression for the Lamb–Oseen-vortex-model maximum circulation was derived in terms of the freestream velocity , the jet-to-freestream velocity ratio , and the jet skew angle , as well as the actuator diameter . Based on the parameterized results, universal values for the Lamb–Oseen-vortex-model parameters at the actuator position were determined for the development of the statistical vortex-generator-jet model. The idea behind the statistical modeling approach is that the vortices are represented by their spanwise-averaged velocity correlations, or vortex stresses, that are added to the turbulence stresses in a Reynolds stress turbulence model. The spanwise-averaged vortex stresses are derived by computing the spanwise-averaged second-order statistics of the vortex flowfield. These vortex-generator-jet model results were compared to the spanwise-averaged vortex stresses from experiments and from fully resolved computational fluid dynamics investigations, and reasonable qualitative as well as quantitative agreement was found.",51,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051988,"A closed-loop plasma-actuated control scheme that relies on the ability to detect incipient flow separation is presented. It is based on the heightened receptivity of the boundary layer to disturbances at the onset of flow separation. A plasma actuator introduces periodic disturbances into the flow at a low-powered “sense state”. A pressure sensor measures the resulting pressure fluctuations close to the leading edge. When the sensed pressure fluctuations exceed a predetermined threshold level, the plasma actuator is switched to a high-powered “control state” that is designed to reattach the flow. The method provides not only a precursor for flow separation but also an indicator of when conditions exist where active flow reattachment is no longer needed. This is demonstrated on a periodically oscillating airfoil that is pitched into “light” and “deep” dynamic stall. The performance of the closed-loop scheme is evaluated by comparing the aerodynamic loading parameters to the baseline and open-loop unsteady controlled cases. In light dynamic stall, control over only 11.2% of the pitch cycle increased the cycle-integrated lift by 12% and reduced the maximum nose-down moment by 60%. In addition, it produced a positive net-cycle damping that was otherwise negative without feedback control.",51,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051930,"Following on previous works showing that far-field jet noise has significant intermittent aspects, the present work assumes that these intermittent events are the dominant feature of jet noise. A definition and method of detection for intermittent noise events is devised and implemented. Using a large experimental database of acoustically subsonic jets with different jet acoustic Mach numbers , nozzle diameters (, 5.08, and 7.62 cm), and jet exit temperature ratios (0.84–2.70), these events are extracted from the far-field noise signals measured in the anechoic chamber of the NASA Glenn Aero-Acoustic Propulsion Laboratory. It is shown that a signal containing only these intermittent events retains all of the important aspects of the acoustic spectrum for jet noise radiating to aft angles, validating the assumption that intermittent events are the dominant feature of aft angle jet noise. Statistical analysis of the characteristics of these noise events reveals that these events can be described in terms of three parameters (the variance of the original signal, the mean width of the events, and the mean time between events) and two universal statistical-distribution curves. The variation of these parameters with noise-radiation direction, nozzle diameter, and jet velocity and temperature are discussed. There is a strong correlation between the mean width of the intermittent events and the mean time between the events in all the cases investigated in this work, implying a strong link between dynamics governing the two quantities.",51,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052009,"Linearized aeroelastic stability and response analyses in the state domain may require the identification of an asymptotically stable finite-state aerodynamic subsystem from available aerodynamic transfer matrices, related to structural motions and gusts. To such an aim, the paper develops an improved rational matrix approximation, combining three nonlinear least squares identification techniques with a system reduction based on a double dynamic residualization. An alternative gust formulation is also presented that, by reconstructing generalized gust forces through the use of special structural motion-like modes called gust modes, makes it possible to determine a gust response even without the usual gust-penetration model in the frequency domain. Examples are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the proposed approaches applied to sample flutter and gust/turbulence response analyses.",51,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051955,"Direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulation of a flat-plate supersonic turbulent boundary layer interacting with an oblique incident shock wave are conducted for a priori and a posteriori assessments of subgrid-scale models. The incident shock is strong enough to generate a marginal separation in the boundary layer near the interaction region providing the subgrid-scale models with a nontrivial challenge. The governing equations for direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulation are solved by a new seventh-order monotonicity-preserving scheme for inviscid fluxes and a sixth-order compact finite-difference scheme for the viscous terms. The effect of subgrid-scale stress term on the resolved velocity field is shown to be significant and shock-dependent. The subgrid-scale models tested include the mixed-time-scale model, the dynamic Smagorinsky model, the dynamic mixed model and a new dynamic model termed the compressible serial-decomposition model. A priori analysis indicate that the new dynamic model is more accurate than other subgrid-scale closures. A posteriori tests also indicate better predictions of direct numerical simulation results by the large-eddy simulation employing the compressible serial-decomposition model.",51,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051990,"In this paper, the stiffness and mass per unit length distributions of a rotating beam, which is isospectral to a given uniform axially loaded nonrotating beam, are determined analytically. The Barcilon–Gottlieb transformation is extended so that it transforms the governing equation of a rotating beam into the governing equation of a uniform, axially loaded nonrotating beam. Analysis is limited to a certain class of Euler–Bernoulli cantilever beams, where the product between the stiffness and the cube of mass per unit length is a constant. The derived mass and stiffness distributions of the rotating beam are used in a finite element analysis to confirm the frequency equivalence of the given and derived beams. Examples of physically realizable beams that have a rectangular cross section are shown as a practical application of the analysis.",51,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052044,"Stability of a supersonic near-wall flow over a shallow grooved plate in the freestream of Mach 6 is investigated by means of numerical simulations and wind-tunnel experiments. Numerical solutions of two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations are used to model propagation of artificial disturbances of several fixed frequencies generated by an actuator placed on the wall. It is shown that the high-frequency forcing excites unstable waves in the flat-plate boundary layer. These waves are relevant to the second-mode instability. The wavy wall damps the disturbances in a high-frequency band while it enhances them at lower frequencies. Stability experiments are conducted in the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Tranzit-M shock tunnel under natural freestream conditions. The measured disturbance spectra are similar to those predicted numerically. They contain a peak associated with the second-mode instability. This peak is damped by the wavy wall, while a marginal increase of the disturbance amplitude is observed at lower frequencies. Although the experiments qualitatively confirm the wavy-wall stabilization concept, further stability and transition measurements are needed to clarify its robustness.",51,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052068,"Based on a more direct analogy between turbulent and molecular transport, a foundation is presented for an energy–vorticity turbulence model. Whereas traditional , , and models relate the eddy viscosity to a dissipation length scale associated with the smaller eddies having the highest strain rates, the proposed model relates the eddy viscosity to a mean vortex wavelength associated with the larger eddies primarily responsible for turbulent transport. A rigorous development of the turbulent-energy-transport equation from the Navier–Stokes equations includes exact relations for the viscous dissipation and molecular transport of turbulent kinetic energy. Application of Boussinesq’s analogy between turbulent and molecular transport leads to a transport equation, which shows neither molecular nor turbulent transport of turbulent energy to be simple gradient diffusion. The new turbulent-energy-transport equation contains two closure coefficients: a viscous-dissipation coefficient and a turbulent-transport coefficient. To help evaluate closure coefficients and provide insight into the energy–vorticity turbulence variables, fully rough pipe flow is considered. For this fully developed flow, excellent agreement with experimental data for velocity profiles and friction factors is attained over a wide range of closure coefficients, provided that a given relation between the coefficients is maintained.",51,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052079,"To investigate whether vortex generators can be an effective form of passive flow control an experimental investigation has been conducted in a small-scale wind tunnel. With specific emphasis on supersonic inlet applications flow separation was initiated using a combined terminal shock wave and subsonic diffuser: a configuration that has been developed as a part of a program to produce a more inlet-relevant flowfield in a small-scale wind tunnel than previous studies. When flow control was initially introduced little overall flow improvement was obtained as the losses tended to be redistributed instead of removed. It became apparent that there existed a strong coupling between the center-span flow and the corner flows. As a consequence, only when flow control was applied to both the corner flows and center-span flow was a significant flow improvement obtained. When corner suction and center-span vortex generators were employed in tandem separation was much reduced and wall-pressure and stagnation pressure were notably improved. As a result, when applied appropriately, it is thought that vortex generators do have the potential to reduce the dependence on boundary-layer bleed for the purpose of separation suppression.",51,5
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052082,"A theoretical linear-stability analysis is used to consider the effect of a passive porous wall on the first Mack mode of a hypersonic boundary layer on a sharp slender cone. The effects of curvature and of the attached shock are included for axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric disturbances. The flow in the hypersonic boundary layer is coupled to the flow in the porous layer. The theoretical models of the porous walls developed in previous studies are used for regular microstructures and random microstructures. The physical parameters chosen correspond to those of their studies. The resulting transcendental equations are solved numerically. Neutral solutions are presented, indicating a destabilizing effect of the porous wall. The spatial growth rates determined demonstrate that the porous wall leads to a significant increase in growth rates for nonaxisymmetric modes. The effects of varying the porous-wall parameters are investigated.",51,5
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052070,"We propose a new implicit computational fluid dynamics method for steady-state compressible reacting flows. The concept is to decouple the total mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations from the species mass and internal energy equations and to solve the two equation sets sequentially. With certain approximations to the implicit system, it is possible to dramatically reduce the cost of the solution with little to no penalty on the convergence properties. Importantly, the cost of the decoupled implicit problem scales linearly with the number of species, as opposed to the quadratic scaling for the conventional fully coupled method. Furthermore, the new approach reduces the memory requirements by a significant factor. The decoupled implicit method shows promise for the application to aerothermodynamics problems and reacting flows.",51,5
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052331,"This paper compares early and very recent approaches to the static analysis of reinforced-shell wing structures. Early approaches were those based on the pure semimonocoque theory along with the beam assumptions of the Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko type. The recent approaches are based on a hierarchical, one-dimensional formulation. These are obtained by adopting various polynomial expansions of the displacement field above the cross-section of the structure according to the unified formulation which was recently proposed by the first author. Two classes were developed in the unified formulation framework. In the first class, Taylor expansion models were developed by exploiting -order Taylor-like polynomials; classical beam theories (Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko) were obtained as special cases of Taylor expansion. In the second class, Lagrange expansion models were built by means of four- and nine-point Lagrange-type polynomials over the cross-section of the wing. The component-wise approach was obtained by using different four- and nine-point Langrangian descriptions for different wing components including panels, ribs, spar caps, stringers, and transverse ribs. The finite element method was used to develop numerical applications in the weak form. Finite element matrices and vectors are expressed in terms of fundamental nuclei whose forms do not formally depend on the order and the expansion. A number of typical aeronautical structures were analyzed, and semimonocoque results were compared to classical (Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko), refined (Taylor expansion), and component-wise (Lagrange expansion) models. Stress and displacement fields of simple statically determinate, redundant, and open-section wing-box structures were analyzed. Finite element models by a commercial software that make use of solid and shell elements were used for comparison purposes. Results have highlighted the enhanced capabilities of the present refined and component-wise formulations. The present component-wise approach appears to be the natural tool to analyze wing structures because it leads to results that can only be obtained by the use of three-dimensional elasticity (solid) elements whose costs are at least one order of magnitude higher than component-wise cases. Component-wise models in conjunction with finite elements could be seen as a modern way of analyzing reinforced-shell structures by removing classical assumptions of constant shear in the spar webs and panels.",51,5
