A complex flowfield develops where shock and expansion waves from a generator body impinge upon the adjacent receiver body and modify its aerodynamic characteristics in comparison to the isolated case. The aim of this research is to quantify and understand the multibody interference effects that arise between a finned slender body and a second disturbance generator body. A parametric wind tunnel study was performed in which the effects of the receiver incidence and axial stagger were considered. Computational fluid dynamic simulations showed good agreement with the measurements, and these were used in the interpretation of the experimental results. The overall interference loads for a given multibody configuration were found to be a complex function of the pressure footprints from the compression and expansion waves emanating from the generator body as well as the flow pitch induced by the generator shockwave. These induced interference loads change sign as the shock impingement location moves aft over the receiver and in some cases cause the receiver body to become statically unstable. Overall, the observed interference effects can modify the subsequent body trajectories and may increase the likelihood of a collision.",54,7

The Navier–Stokes equations are integrated using an implicit finite volume shock-capturing method with the second-order approximation in space and time. After computing the laminar flowfield, unsteady disturbances are imposed onto the steady solution via local suction blowing on the wall surface. The undisturbed boundary layer separates upstream of the corner and reattaches downstream, forming a shallow separation bubble. The suction-blowing pulse generates a three-dimensional wave packet propagating downstream. If the pulse is produced near the leading edge, the wave packet is dominated by oblique waves relevant to the first mode, whereas plane waves of the second mode are relatively small. At sufficiently strong forcing, the nonlinear effects destabilize the wave packet in the separation region and lead to its nonlinear breakdown downstream of the reattachment line. Ultimately, a young turbulent spot is formed in the reattached boundary layer. If the pulse is produced sufficiently far downstream of the leading edge, so that the major portion of the first-mode instability region is not involved, the wave packet is dominated by the second mode. These examples show that the wave-packet contents and its downstream evolution strongly depend on how and where the initial disturbance is excited.",54,7
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053807,"Previous attempts have been made to optimize the performance of film-cooling slots for cutback trailing edges, but these involved the use of steady calculation methods, which have been shown to be inappropriate for accurately capturing the behavior of this class of flows. Here, an unsteady method (large-eddy simulation on a coarse grid, or very large-eddy simulation) is used to compute the flow. To take advantage of the enormous parallel capacity of modern supercomputers and distributed computing nets, as well as the relatively low cost of very large-eddy simulation, while at the same time mitigating its lower scope for significant parallelization, a perfectly parallel evolutionary optimization process was undertaken. A relatively crude optimization target of maximizing the adiabatic wall film-cooling effectiveness averaged over the entire exposed cutback surface was used as a proof of concept. The optimizing heuristic then used an evolutionary approach to design a turbulator planform, subject to some imposed design restrictions. Six hundred large-eddy simulation type simulations were carried out over 12 generations, and the best performing designs from the last generation are examined. The optimized design showed a considerable improvement in the target metric over the previous experimental geometries. The influence of various geometric parameters on several of the metrics of film cooling is also explored by mining data from the populations generated over the course of the optimization. In a targeted optimization exercise, it is likely that these data could be used to steer the course of the evolution down favorable paths more quickly.",54,7

It is possible to deconvolve and isolate the role of oxygen to the negative-going or forward stroke of the discharge and to the region of parameter space with high : a change in oxygen content by a factor of 20 yields only a 20% increase in force produced when 12 kV AC is applied to the system but yields a 170% increase when the voltage amplitude is increased by less than a factor of 2, to 20 kV applied. It is shown that substituting for produces a mild net increase in force production that saturates at very low concentrations (0.1%) and that the increase is limited because of substantial (50%) losses of the momentum to drag even though the momentum input is increased by a factor of 2.",54,7
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054533,"Supersonic branching flows are commonly found in industrial processes like the supersonic aerosol particle separation process and the supersonic inlet of combined aeroengines. In this research, we carry out a numerical study on the supersonic branching flow to reveal its features and its effects on aerosol particle separation. It is found that there are four flow regimes and a critical state in the supersonic branching flow in terms of the shock wave positions, which are determined by the backpressures of the two outlets. The gas flow rate ratio and the particle separation ratio are closely related to the flow regimes. There is a steady working zone where the gas flow rate ratio and the particle separation ratio maintain as constant as the two backpressures vary. In swirling flows, there is a drift of the critical state. In the range of particle sizes studied here, the particle motion is not sensitive to the variations of the particle size in the absence of swirl, but it is not the case for swirling flows. Finally, some features of the steady working zone are discussed. This work is a preliminary research into supersonic branching flow and provides a foundation for the design of relevant devices.",54,7
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054732,"A series of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations is performed for a supersonic wall-bounded turbulent corner flow. These simulations are compared to a high-order implicit large-eddy simulation for the same geometry and flow conditions. Inclusion of the quadratic constitutive relation in the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation results in significant improvement in qualitative agreement with the large-eddy simulation: specifically, the presence of secondary flow (a counter-rotating vortex pair). The range of valid values for the constant in the quadratic constitutive relation formulation is explored. Additionally, the effects on this range from different turbulence models and momentum thickness Reynolds numbers for the corner are also examined. These effects of the quadratic constitutive relation are explored using both the finite difference fluid solver OVERFLOW and the finite volume fluid solver US3D. The results indicate that the quadratic constitutive relation term directly affects the strength of the vortex pair in the secondary flow and that its influence appears directly dependent on all the aforementioned parameters.",54,7
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054649,"In this study, active flutter control and closed-loop flutter identification were experimentally studied for a low-aspect-ratio wing model in an Nanhang-2 subsonic wind tunnel. To actively suppress the flutter of the wing model in wind-tunnel tests, a real-time digital control system was developed so as to complete the data acquisition, digital signal processing, computation of the control strategy, and servo control of the actuator. Using the digital control system, wind-tunnel tests were conducted to examine the flutter control of the wing model. The experimental results showed that the linear feedback controller designed via the optimization of pole assignment can effectively suppress the flutter instability. Moreover, for the high-dimensional aeroservoelastic system, the online estimation of closed-loop flutter modes is a challenging problem because the flutter identification from closed-loop measurements may lead to biased estimates, and the identification efficiency must be improved. Therefore, as the second task of this study, the online closed-loop flutter identification of the wing model was explored. To efficiently identify the flutter modes, a fast recursive subspace identification method was used. The experimental results show that the natural frequencies and modal damping ratios of the closed-loop flutter modes could be accurately tracked over a wide range of flow speeds.",54,7
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054042,"Experiments in closed-section wind tunnels are more suitable for comparisons with numerical results than corresponding experiments in open-section tunnels because well-defined boundary conditions far from the model can be established for the numerics. This paper reports acoustic experimental results on the slat region of a two-dimensional high-lift model. An objective was the production of experimental data to be used in the testing of numerical procedures. Conventional beamforming combined with a deconvolution technique was used. The Reynolds number was approximately 1 million, whereas Mach number and angle of attack ranged from ~0.07 to and 2 to 10 deg, respectively. To prevent interaction between wind-tunnel-wall boundary layers and the model, which causes undesirable three-dimensionality, suction was applied on the wind-tunnel walls, and its effect was investigated. Experimental results for two angles of attack were compared with computational results given by a lattice–Boltzmann solver for the validation of the experimental procedure based on side-wall suction and deconvolved source map computations. The results agreed, in particular regarding the dominant parts of the spectra, and were considered a cross validation of both experimental and numerical approaches. The numerical results were used in the characterization of the flow in the slat cove.",54,7
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054260,"A particle accelerated computational fluid dynamics/boundary element method technique to predict the sound pressure field produced by low Mach number flow past a rigid body is presented. An incompressible computational fluid dynamics solver is used to calculate the transient hydrodynamic flowfield. A near-field formulation based on Lighthill’s analogy is coupled with a particle condensation technique to predict the incident acoustic field and its normal derivative on the body. The near-field formulation involves singular surface and volume integrals, which are regularized via singularity subtraction. A particle condensation technique is applied to accelerate the incident field computations and reduce the amount of data that must be stored during the computational fluid dynamics analysis. The incident field is then combined with a boundary element method model of the body, and the scattered sound pressure field is obtained by solving the Burton–Miller boundary integral equations. The accuracy and computational cost of the particle accelerated computational fluid dynamics/boundary element method approach is demonstrated by calculating the incident acoustic field on a cylinder in crossflow under laminar and turbulent flow conditions as well as predicting the scattered and far-field sound pressures.",54,7
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054300,"Experimental unsteady centerbody surface pressures measured in a low-boom inlet have been analyzed and compared with an unsteady computational flow approach. The experimental dataset was gathered at the supersonic wind tunnel at the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center in 2010. The axisymmetric external compression inlet considered herein featured a relaxed isentropic centerbody compression spike followed by a short subsonic diffuser to the aerodynamic interface plane. The axisymmetric inlet computational domain comprised a 10 deg sector, starting with the freestream inflow region, and included both the internal flowpath up to the mass flow plug and the external flow past the sharp-edged cowl for external flow. The selected inlet test conditions were based on a 1.67 freestream Mach number at a zero angle of attack with a near-design spillage rate of approximately 4%. Both experiments and simulations revealed temporal shifts between pressure peaks at different streamwise locations, indicating upstream-running compression waves that moved at acoustic speeds. These waves became amplified near the geometric throat and produced streamwise oscillations of the external normal shock. The simulations also revealed a second smaller shock on the centerbody at the geometric throat, for which the complex dynamics suggested an opportunity for further study.",54,7
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054543,An efficient finite element modeling approach is presented for analyzing the general cross-sectional stiffness properties and stress distribution of thin- and thick-walled sections with isotropic and general anisotropic materials. The procedure is based on discretizing the walls of the section using a single layer of displacement-based elements whereby the element’s stiffness is obtained using Gaussian quadrature through each layer. The interlaminar stresses are recovered at points of interest via a three-dimensional equilibrium-based postprocessing scheme that uses the distribution of in-plane stress gradients derived in the local laminate coordinate system. The theory is illustrated by application to three composite sections of various shapes and material layups.,54,7
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054646,"A new computational framework called the sequential subspace reliability method (SSRM) is presented. This method decomposes the multidimensional random space into multiple two-dimensional subspaces. In this manner, SSRM is able to approximate bivariate interaction effects. When the reliability estimate contribution is calculated subspace by subspace, the final assessment is updated in a progressive manner. The iterative history of sequential reliability assessment can be used to understand the complexity and convergence behavior of the limit state function of interest. In a decision-making situation, the flexibility of the proposed SSRM to provide iterative updates on reliability estimation becomes especially valuable in dealing with large-scale and complex problems under the constraints of limited time and resources. To calculate the individual subspace contributions, a novel univariate revolving integration (URI) method is proposed. The URI method takes advantage of the axisymmetric nature of a joint probability density function and provides an additional layer of flexibility in updating the reliability contribution within each subspace. This flexibility allows the estimation of bivariate and high-order effects to be addressed if resources allow. Additionally, URI is composed of multiple one-dimensional integrals that allow the use of regression models to be used with high confidence. The computational benefits of using the proposed method is demonstrated with several numerical examples of mathematical, structural, and an aircraft conceptual sizing problem.",54,7
