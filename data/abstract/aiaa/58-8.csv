Validation is performed by comparing against the well-known Ekman layer case. Moreover, two new compressible validation cases are proposed for which very good agreement is well obtained. Linear stability analysis is then performed on a rotating fan blade with incoming flow, which is obtained by means of a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computation. By neglecting or taking into account rotation in the linear stability equations, the effect of rotation on transition mechanisms is investigated. Moreover, factors are computed for transition prediction. The present results show that rotation hardly modifies the growth rate of Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities. However, rotation destabilizes stationary crossflow waves, but not enough to trigger transition.",58,8

The primary objectives of this investigation were to describe the evolution of the flow and to quantify the characteristic timescales of dominant fluctuations in the off-body flowfield. These objectives were achieved through a combination of time-resolved particle image velocimetry and spectral analysis using empirical mode decomposition. Using spectral analysis, the velocity fluctuations near the leading edge were observed to be in an amplified state during the initial ejection of vortical structures. During this amplified phase, the most dominant velocity fluctuation modes were associated with displacement-thickness-based Strouhal numbers between and . The variation in the frequency of the dominant fluctuation modes was also analyzed as a function of the angle of attack. A numerical implementation of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation was used to extract the spatially unstable modes associated with the velocity profiles at the airfoil leading edge. The amplified frequencies from linear stability analysis were found to be consistent with those determined from the spectral analysis of the acquired velocity field.",58,8

Because stall flutter is mainly understood from the point of view of dynamic stall, it has been generally agreed that the oscillations associated with negative aerodynamic damping occur about a large angle of attack. In contrast, symmetric oscillations about the origin are reported in this work, where the amplitude of oscillation, ranging from 30° to about 50°, is limited by flow separation. The elastic axis is fixed at . The airspeed is varied over a range of Reynolds numbers extending from to . For experiments in 2DOFs, the stiffness in pitch is kept constant, whereas the heave stiffness is changed to cover a range of frequency ratios, . Except for cases with frequency ratios close to one, the introduction of the DOF in heave does not significantly affect the LCO dynamics. It is determined that the stall flutter observed is fundamentally a 1DOF problem in pitch, whereby the pitch motion drives the heave motion. Nonetheless, the work done by the lift force (on the heave) is larger than the work done by the aerodynamic moment (on the pitch).",58,8
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058990,"Turbulent flow is ubiquitous in nature and also has wide industrial applications. The direct observation of turbulent flow can help us to gain the fundamental insights of its physics. However, the experimental measurement of complete velocity fields in real time with high spatial and temporal resolutions is difficult due to the limitations of sensors and sensing techniques, such as sensor accessibility and sampling rate. Recently, a physics-based compressive sensing (PBCS) approach was proposed to reduce the number of sensors and amount of data collection to monitor temperature distributions with a very high compression ratio. In this Paper, the PBCS mechanism for monitoring turbulent flow is formulated. By recovering the boundary conditions in the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations from some limited velocity measurements, the complete velocity field is reconstructed from the model. The application of PBCS to the steady-state turbulent flow is demonstrated and validated with experimental data of direct measurements.",58,8

In the current study, a unified form of law of the wall is proposed for the mean streamwise velocity in the turbulent boundary layer with zero pressure gradient. From the physical perspective, the improved form of the law is capable of reflecting the actual weight variations between the molecular viscosity and the turbulence-eddy viscosity in the viscous, transition, and logarithmic sublayers. In the viscous sublayer, a variety of direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, including 19 groups, are used to examine the proposed law. In the transition and logarithmic sublayers, 19 groups of canonical DNS velocity profiles and 14 groups of reliable experimental data are used to confirm the applicability and accuracy of the present formula under a wider ranges of Reynolds numbers. The local and maximum relative errors are given and analyzed in detail. The results show that the improved form of the law is sufficiently accurate to represent the mean streamwise velocities in the viscous, transition, and logarithmic sublayers. The present work is helpful for prediction of mean velocity behaviors in engineering.",58,8

To precisely estimate the structural vibration excited by a TBL, an improved technique is proposed and developed for the prediction of wall pressure fluctuations induced by a high-speed flow. First, an integrated expression is given to describe wall pressure fluctuations in different situations, and a conventional phase array technique is employed to identify the wave numbers of the wall pressure fluctuations and noise. Then, the pressure fluctuations are separated from the noise by a modified subsection approaching method. To improve the resolution of the low-frequency noise, an accelerated focusing method is developed and used in this paper. A variable spacing array design is proposed to improve the calculation accuracy of the broadband pressure fluctuation separation. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to fix the error range of the noise wave numbers in which the pressure fluctuation and noise calculation converges to the actual value. Finally, a wind-tunnel test is performed to validate the proposed method in this work.",58,8
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059201,"A systematic investigation is carried out in order to determine the response of a constant-temperature hot-wire anemometer in compressible subsonic flow. An empirical expression for the instantaneous heat transfer from the sensor has been successfully fitted to extensive calibration data, which were collected specifically for this purpose. This expression leads to analytical expressions for the sensitivity coefficients of the anemometer output to velocity, density, pressure, and total-temperature fluctuations. The previously claimed equality of the velocity and density sensitivity coefficients in compressible subsonic flows is strongly contradicted by the present analysis and experimental data, which show that, under certain subsonic conditions, the velocity sensitivity decreases dramatically and even vanishes, whereas the density sensitivity retains relatively large values. Finally, a practical expression for the error in the velocity variance estimated from the hot-wire voltage fluctuations by neglecting pressure and total-temperature fluctuations has been derived. When evaluated for the present sensors, the error bound is found to become large, especially for Mach numbers near 0.8.",58,8
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059035,"In this paper, insight is provided into the modeling of single-point and two-point statistics of a subsonic round jet discharged into a moving ambient medium. An experimental campaign has been performed comprising two round, unheated air flows: a central jet at Mach number equal to 0.6 surrounded by a slower flight flow. Constant-temperature hot-wire anemometry was used to measure both the axial and radial velocity fluctuations within the turbulent jet flowfield. A Mach 0.6 jet was discharged into the flight flow, which ranged from zero up to Mach 0.3. The data show that the degree to which the jet stretches with increasing flight velocity can be discerned with the knowledge of the decay of the mean velocity field downstream of the end of the jet’s potential core. This stretching factor can then be used to predict the changes in the static jet turbulence statistics for the in-flight case. Additionally, in the region of high-turbulence kinetic energy, the two-point statistics can be estimated using information about the single-point statistics and the local mean velocity. Empirical models for the in-flight jet’s shear stresses, cross-correlations, and power spectral density functions are presented and compared with those derived for the static jet case.",58,8

Droplets of three sizes (500, 950, and of radius) were allowed to fall in the path of an incoming airfoil while shadowgraph images were recorded by a high-speed video camera at 40,000 fps. The airfoil model was placed at the end of a rotating arm and moved at four velocities (30, 40, 50, and ). Three different regions of the shoulder were tested. Droplet deformation and trajectories are presented. Droplets evolve as a conjunction of two half-oblate spheroids that tilt as the model approaches. The tilting is larger in the higher regions of the shoulder. The trajectory model derived for droplet in the stagnation line of a moving airfoil has been formally derived for the shoulder region and applied to the experimental data, showing very good agreement being the mean discrepancy less than 4% for the trajectory and 10% for the deformation.",58,8
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059264,"The dielectric-barrier-discharge (DBD) plasma actuator is a popular technology for active flow control; however, the influence of the heat generated by the actuator on its performance is seldom mentioned. In this work, an experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate the interaction between spontaneous heat generation and the performance of an alternating-current DBD (AC-DBD) plasma actuator. The characteristics of the AC-DBD plasma actuator are examined temporally in quiescent air, including the profile of the induced flow, capacitance properties, power consumption, plasma light emission, and surface temperature. The particle image velocimetry shows that the velocity profile of the induced flow increases temporally, indicating enhanced momentum injection by the AC-DBD plasma actuator. The capacitance, power consumption, plasma brightness, and surface temperature increase with the operation time analogously to exponential curves , and the values of these properties are proportional to 3.5 power of the applied voltage. The dielectric surface is categorized into three typical streamwise regions according to the heat generation characteristics: the plasma region, the insulated electrode region, and the far-field region. The dominant heat generation occurs in the plasma region due to the plasma discharge. The temperature increase of the local dielectric and the gas–plasma mixture enlarges the actuator capacitance, benefits the local induced electric field, and results in longer mean free paths of particles and stronger discharges accordingly. Thus, the spontaneous heat generation affects the induced ionic wind, and the performance of the AC-DBD plasma actuator is time dependent during the early period of the operation.",58,8
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058912,"A novel actuator concept is evaluated in a series of active flow control experiments on a resonant high-speed cavity flow. The actuator generates pulsed supersonic microjets by using the resonance of an impinging microjet source, and with smart materials incorporated into its design, the actuator’s resonant frequency can be actively controlled. The actuator was designed such that its resonant frequency would lie within the range of predicted cavity resonance. Results from Mach 1.5 flow over a cavity of length are presented, and the actuator’s performance is evaluated across three modes of operation: pulsed, active pulsed, and steady. In the active pulsed mode, the smart materials are used to actively vary the actuator’s resonant frequency, enabling frequency modulation of the actuator’s output. When the actuator operates in both pulsed modes, the amplitude of the dominant peak in the cavity’s unsteady pressure spectra is reduced by as much as 7 dB. However, steady microjet injection yields more effective control. The dominant peak is substantially attenuated (by 25 dB) in this mode of operation. The effectiveness of the steady mode is attributed to higher momentum flux that can be attained in contrast to the pulsed modes of operation.",58,8
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059039,"Traditional acoustic liners used in damping sound in aircraft applications consist of a porous face sheet, honeycomb core, and solid backing. Experiments have observed that, under conditions of high tonal sound levels, there occurs a dramatic increase in the viscous drag in the turbulent boundary layers over these surfaces. The mechanism for this increase in drag is the topic of interest. This involves experiments on a series of acoustic liners with fabricated porous sheets having a range of hole diameters, spacing, and patterns. The hole spacing spanned a range of viscous spanwise length scales from . The boundary-layer measurements include mean velocity and turbulence intensity profiles, velocity spectra, and turbulence burst, ejection, and sweep statistics based on the variable interval time-averaging and -quadrant methods. Coupled with this are direct drag measurements of the acoustic liners. The results show a dramatic increase in drag at frequencies near acoustic resonance and at high sound levels. This is presumed to be driven by net zero mass jets emanating from the porous sheets. For the experimental data available, the largest increase in drag is observed for the smaller spanwise distance between perforations, which is comparable to the typical spanwise wavelength of wall streak structures in turbulent boundary layers. The increase in drag is correlated with an increase in the turbulence wall layer burst and ejection events.",58,8
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058878,"The influence of the vortex impingement location on the aerodynamic and acoustic response of a rotating blade during an orthogonal interaction is studied by means of computational fluid dynamics. The objective is to identify and quantify precisely the noise reduction achieved by reducing the blade span. The Batchelor vortex model is primarily considered as it accounts for the axial velocity deficit observed in the core of realistic tip vortices. Separated simulations were also carried out for a Lamb–Oseen vortex and a purely axial velocity deficit to highlight and quantify the influence of the vortex velocity components on the interaction as well as to balance design optimizations performed relying on methods not able to model viscous effects. The analysis of the blade aerodynamic and acoustic responses shows that the magnitude of the thrust fluctuation and radiated noise are always higher for a Batchelor vortex than for a Lamb–Oseen vortex when the vortex core impinges below the blade tip. For both vortex models, the thrust fluctuation and radiated noise reach their peak for an interaction close to the blade tip. They decrease slowly as the vortex impingement moves inward the blade and decrease strongly as the vortex passes above the tip. Finally, the noise directivity pattern is dipolar for the interaction close to or above the blade tip and becomes more and more quadrupolar as the radius of the interaction moves toward the blade root.",58,8
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058231,A postprocessing methodology of microphone-array results for accurate source localization and separation is described. A method constrained iterative restoration algorithm with an assumption of uncorrelated sources is used to extract quantitative spectral results for multiple noise sources identified on a wall-mounted finite-span swept and cambered airfoil tested in an open-jet aeroacoustic facility. This allows understanding of the contribution of each source in the noise generation process. The total sound pressure level is reconstructed from the individual spectra of each noise source and extrapolated in the far field to be compared with a single-microphone spectrum. The Bayesian algorithm is used to improve the comparison between reconstructed and experimental spectra because it takes into account the coherent nature of the sources. The analytical models of the source mechanisms and of their spanwise correlation are proposed as a tool to define future improvements.,58,8

However, recent modifications to large eddy-simulation (LES) methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high-temperature ratio in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly heated laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer as well as along the nozzle lip line shows evidence of distinct noise production mechanisms that transfer information differently from the flow to the field. A phenomenological comparison between the LES and measurements of an afterburning F-35 aircraft is then made. Although the LES is not run at the exact same conditions as the aircraft and does not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraft’s jet noise field, differences between noise production mechanisms observed in the LES may describe some of the spatiospectral lobe phenomena observed in the measurements of the F-35.",58,8

The jet is a correctly expanded Mach 1.8 supersonic jet, the plate angle is 45 deg, and the nozzle–plate distance is five times the nozzle height. Three types of acoustic waves, namely, 1) a wave propagating normal to the wall, 2) a wave propagating upstream from the top and bottom of the plate shock, and 3) a wave propagating omnidirectionally from the first tail shock, which are consistent with those in Akamine’s experiment, are observed. The acoustic wave generation mechanisms are 1) a rapid growth of pressure amplitude downstream of the plate shock, 2) a deformation of the plate shock accompanied with the oscillation of the stagnation pressure, and 3) a cyclic pressure fluctuation due to the cyclic change in the shock structure near the first tail shock. Although the flowfield studied is simple compared with the actual rocket launch flow environment, the mechanism revealed in this study will provide a useful insight into understanding the sound generation mechanism in a complicated three-dimensional turbulent impinging jet.",58,8

The spike length (, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0), spike stem diameter (, 0.12, 0.18), and spike tip shapes are varied, and their influence on the time-averaged and time-resolved flowfield is examined. When increases, a significant reduction in drag is achieved at , whereas the variation in has only a minor effect. The intensity of the shock-related unsteadiness is reduced with an increase in from 0.06 to 0.18, whereas changes in have a negligible effect. The effects of spike tip geometry are studied by replacing the sharp spike tip with a hemispherical one having three different base shapes (vertical base, circular base, and elliptical base). A hemispherical spike tip with a vertical base is performing better by reducing and flow unsteadiness. The dominant spatiotemporal mode arising due to the shock-related unsteadiness is represented through modal analysis of time-resolved shadowgraph images, and the findings are consistent with the other measurements.",58,8

This study represents the application of an optical diagnostic technique, thermally assisted laser-induced fluorescence, to the temperature measurements in the combustor of a supersonic combustion engine. The experiments were conducted in the T4 shock tunnel using a scramjet model. Experimental data were obtained by focusing a laser beam into the combustor and exciting the OH radical. A detailed numerical model that simulates all radiative and collisional processes of relevance with the appropriate system of differential equations was developed for the analysis of the influence of energy transfer processes on the fluorescence signal.

The new method discretizes the three-dimensional preassigned shock surface into a multitude of stream surfaces, which are composed of multiple local osculating planes. The flowfield within each stream surface is computed on the same fictional meridian plane based on a new schematic of method of characteristics. In this way, the constraint of obligating the streamline initiating from the discrete leading edge point to flow within the same osculating plane is removed. Two types of shock waves with distinct three-dimensional characteristics are specified as input to demonstrate the validity of the new proposed method. At the same time, two typical waveriders, which are not easily generated by the past waverider design methods, are derived and validated by the inviscid computational fluid dynamics simulation (Euler code). The results indicate that waveriders based on the new method can successfully reproduce the preassigned shock waves and the original flowfields with errors less than 2%. Thus, the local-turning osculating cones method offers a far-improved capability to design waveriders, and it is favorable for hypersonic airframe propulsion integration.",58,8

Based on these formulations, three methods are proposed that use linear interpolation (lerp) or an artificial neural network (ANN) for their flamelet tables: form1-ann, form2-lerp, and form2-ann. First, it will be shown that the accuracy of the ANN in the proposed form1-ann and form2-ann methods is sufficient for numerical simulations. Then, to evaluate the form2-lerp and form2-ann methods and show that they can greatly improve the computational performance of the conventional method, numerical simulations will be conducted for the scramjet test-engine combustor of the German Aerospace Center, DLR.

The PDC consists of two units: the deflagration to detonation transition section, and the exhaust tube with a straight nozzle. High-speed high-resolution schlieren images visualize the shock dynamics downstream of the nozzle. The flow dynamics during one full PDC cycle is examined via high-speed particle image velocimetry. A well-suited solid tracer particle for supersonic reactive flow is determined in a preliminary study to minimize the PIV measurement error. The investigated operating conditions of the PDC differ in fill fraction, which is the percentage of the tube filled with a reactive mixture. With increasing fill fraction, the flow features grow in size and strength as the propagation velocity of the leading shock increases. The blowdown process of the PDC is characterized by several exhaust and suction phases. An increase in the fill fraction results in a stronger first exhaust phase, whereas the subsequent suction and exhaust phases remain almost unaffected.",58,8

Whether this ejection occurs and its intensity and direction depend on the breakdown parameters and can affect subsequent flame growth in combustible mixtures. One approach to alter, and potentially control, the character of this ejection is a dual-pulse configuration. Detailed simulations are used to study the post-breakdown hydrodynamics in an inert gas, which reproduce key experimental observations. In the first configuration analyzed, a weak pulse disrupts vorticity generation by a stronger pulse, suppressing the ejection that would have been produced by the stronger one alone.

In concept, the digital twin would be tuned to accurately describe the behavior of the vehicle, and then it would be updated as the vehicle is modified or ages. Unfortunately, the linear model correlation and validation techniques that are commonly used in the aerospace industry are not valid for nonlinear models, so a new set of tools is needed. This work presents an algorithm to update geometrically nonlinear reduced-order models using nonlinear normal modes as a correlation metric. The nonlinear normal modes serve as a strong metric to correlate the numerical models because they can be extracted from experiments, and they describe the dynamics of the nonlinear system over a range of amplitudes and are independent of the loading applied to the system. This paper presents a novel method of computing analytical gradients of nonlinear normal mode solutions with respect to system parameters using the multiharmonic balance method.

To be used in aerospace applications, the large deformation behavior of the alloy should be investigated with a high-fidelity crystal plasticity model. However, there is no universal agreement on the crystal plasticity parameters, and previous efforts are only based on deterministic techniques. Therefore, our goal is to build a crystal plasticity model for Ti-7Al, which is validated for the global (component-scale) and local (grain-level) features by considering the experimental uncertainty. In the first step, the lower and upper bounds of the crystal plasticity parameters are determined with an inverse problem that is solved to match the computations with the experimental stress-strain data. The second step validates the local features by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between the simulated and experimental microstructural textures. The optimization is performed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN-)based surrogate model that is trained within the lower and upper limits of the parameters obtained in the first step. The outcomes of the two-step approach demonstrate significant improvement over the previous deterministic solutions.",58,8

All layers of the sandwich cylinder are formulated based on the first-order shear deformation theory. Considering the von Karman strain displacement relations, the nonlinear equations of motion are derived through Hamilton’s principle. By separating the displacement components into previbration and vibration states and substituting in the obtained nonlinear equations of motion, the previbration equilibrium equations and vibration equations of motion are obtained. The acquired equations are solved by applying the generalized differential quadrature method. The method is validated by comparing the obtained results with those available in the literature. The effects of temperature, length-to-radius ratio, and radius-to-thickness ratio on the fundamental loss factor of sandwich cylindrical shells are examined at different boundary conditions. Also, variation of the fundamental loss factor of the sandwich shell with variation in the thickness of the constraining and core layers is investigated. The results show superior effect of the mode shape switching phenomenon on the fundamental mode loss factor variation. Temperature rise results in significant reduction of loss factor values.

27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058947,"Accurate stress responses are the basics for failure analysis of aerospace structures, but they still can be challenging in numerical simulations for dynamic systems. This work exploits the stress mode shapes (SMSs) in local finite element (FE) refinement for the purpose of accurate dynamic stress estimation. Toward structural FE modeling, identification of critical locations via predominant SMSs is theoretically demonstrated. To pursue more accurate dynamic stress, a strategy for local FE refinement is proposed by using the information from stress modal analysis. The strategy involves a two-step procedure. First, modal participation factors (MPFs) are used to extract the predominant modes. Second, retained SMSs are evaluated for the local remeshing. Numerical simulations of a representative thin plate with geometric details were conducted. The SMSs were investigated in detail. Together with MPFs, SMSs can help to localize the dangerous stresses and then refine the local meshes to accurately calculate stress responses. By taking full advantage of numerically obtained SMSs, local structural FE modeling can be applied in a straightforward way with high efficiency. Results indicate that SMSs can reveal the underlying mechanism that governs the overall dynamic stress response.",58,8
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059393,"Turbomachinery blisks have very low damping and, for this reason, they require devices such as ring dampers to mitigate excessive vibrations. Ring dampers rely on the relative motion between a ringlike component and the blisk to dissipate energy by means of friction. Damper effectiveness is typically low due to the absence of relative motion between the damper and the blisk. Tuned mass dampers can mitigate the low relative motion and can be particularly effective when the forcing is narrowband. Tuned mass dampers transfer vibration energy from the host structure to the damper, where this energy can be dissipated by friction. These two features are particularly useful when the host structure has very low damping and when there are stringent constraints on the position of the damper, as is the case for turbomachinery blisks. In this paper, a tuned vibration damper concept is explored. A cantilever beam is used to represent a blisk blade. The vibration reduction provided by the use of a tuned mass damper with contacts is studied both computationally and experimentally. Numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the model and to gain insight into the energy dissipation phenomena and the working principles of such dampers.",58,8

The wing box is modeled using 1.47 million isoparametric hexahedral elements, whereas the skin (which is nondesignable) is modeled using shell elements.

Results suggest that critical variables are the microphone sensitivity and positioning. Different microphone arrays are considered to reduce uncertainty levels. Also, it is observed that, in general, the Kumaresan–Tufts algorithm achieves better accuracy than the original Prony’s method. Finally, the Monte Carlo method is used to evaluate uncertainty levels on NASA benchmark data, and the results corroborate the numerical experiments analysis.",58,8
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058874,"The focus of this investigation is on modeling uncertainties on the structural and thermal properties of heated structures and assessing their effects on the resulting temperature distributions and structural response. This effort is accomplished within the framework of reduced-order models (ROMs) of both the thermal (heat conduction) and structural (nonlinear geometric response) problems relying on the maximum entropy nonparametric approach. Uncertainties are introduced on both the heat conduction and the structural response problems. In the latter, it is in particular shown that the purely structural terms of the ROM governing equations and those associated with the structural–thermal coupling should be randomized jointly. Moreover, this can be done through the construction of a large matrix that includes all of these terms and is shown to be symmetric and positive definite. Several challenges in applying this approach are identified and resolved. Finally, the applicability of the methodology is demonstrated on the response of a simple panel subjected to an oscillating heating flux as an example of strongly coupled thermal–structural problems.",58,8
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058492,"To allow an efficient preliminary design, a grid pattern or configuration optimization strategy is proposed for grid-stiffened composite structures under the constraint of sustaining the buckling resistant capability. This is achieved by first introducing a configuration vector for representing stiffeners in a grid unit, which is applicable for the description of iso-grid, ortho-grid -grid, and bi-grid. The parametric equivalent stiffener model of the structure is derived by the smearing method, and the global and local buckling loads are calculated for the different grid configurations. The artificial bee colony algorithm was used as an optimizer to address the discrete design variable space, including a grid-unit size, height, and thickness of stiffeners that could be specified by designers or manufacturing requirements. Two test examples validated the effectiveness of the approach. The results suggested that both optimal and suboptimal solutions can be considered effectively as design options in the preliminary stage of design for such types of structures.",58,8
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059238,"For fixed values of the areal mass density, product of the midsurface curvilinear lengths, and the choice from three unidirectional fiber (glass, graphite, or aramid) reinforced composites for facesheets, one- and two-core doubly curved sandwich shell’s geometries, fiber material, and fiber orientations for the facesheets are found that maximize the first failure load. Also determined are the locations of failure points and stress components significantly contributing to the failure, as well as the effects of uncertainties in values of material parameters on the failure load. The shell’s quasi-static and infinitesimal deformations are analyzed with a third-order shear and normal deformable plate/shell theory, in-plane stresses are found by using the plate theory deformations and transverse stresses using a one-step stress recovery scheme. The Tsai–Wu failure criteria, and honeybees inspired nest-site selection optimization algorithm are employed. Effects of uncertainties in material parameters are quantified by the Latin hypercube method and a statistical software, JMP. The predicted failure load and the failure point location agree well with their experimental values. It is observed that the first failure occurs in a core (facesheet) due to the transverse shear stress (in-plane transverse axial stress) exceeding its critical value. The methodology can be used to design the minimum weight optimal doubly curved multicore sandwich shells.",58,8
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058999,"Studying buckling behavior of large shell structures through full-scale test articles can be complex and expensive. Therefore, reduced-scale structures are often preferred for investigating buckling behavior. However, designing reduced-scale structures that are representative of the full-scale structure can be difficult. An analytical scaling methodology for compression-loaded sandwich composite cylindrical shells based on the nondimensionalization of the buckling equations is presented herein. The methodology was used to develop scaled configurations that show similar buckling responses to the full-scale baseline configuration. Finite element analysis results showed that both a baseline and a scaled configuration buckled similarly, when the nondimensional stiffness, defined as the ratio between the nondimensional load and nondimensional displacement, was matched between the different scale models. Limitations of the methodology are discussed and are believed to be a result of neglecting the flexural anisotropy and the transverse shear compliance. A preliminary material failure assessment for the different scales is also considered.",58,8
35,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058717,"There has been considerable interest in stratospheric airships that have their unique role in environmental monitoring and surveillance, communication transmission, and carrying weapons, among other uses. The problem presented in this paper is that the test values of pressure resistance are far from the theoretical values of spherical balls, which are made up of plain-weave fabrics. In this paper, the uniaxial tension in structural layers has been tested to certify the validity of the finite element analysis (FEA) models. A boundary condition that is suitable for airship envelope simulation analysis is also proposed here. Using the secondary development function of Abaqus, an FEA model of three-dimensional plain-weave fabric is then established to simulate the envelope inflation experiments. Finally, the stress behavior of the microstructure of plain-weave fabric is summarized, and several conclusions are obtained.",58,8
