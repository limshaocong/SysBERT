0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051499,"It is desirable to predict the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of extremely high-aspect ratio wings for high-altitude/long-endurance applications. Such results give insight into structural response and serve as a precursor to flutter and gust response calculations. The influence of rigid body modes has been shown to be significant for the aeroelastic response of these aircraft, but this effect is frequently not captured in a laboratory setting. Additionally, resonant frequencies can be difficult to predict when multiple discrete masses such as engines or mission pods are distributed along the span. In this work, the resonant frequencies of a high-altitude/long-endurance wing mounted on a spring of variable stiffness with both root and tip stores are determined analytically from classical beam theory. The model is then extended through a component-mode synthesis to incorporate multiple spanwise masses of any discrete distribution. Computational results are compared with an experiment, and good agreement is shown.",51,6
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051573,"This paper addresses the preliminary robust design of a small/medium–scale reentry unmanned space vehicle. A hybrid optimization technique is proposed that couples an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm with a direct-transcription method for optimal control problems. Uncertainties on the aerodynamic forces and vehicle mass are integrated in the design process, and the hybrid algorithm searches for geometries that 1) minimize the mean value of the maximum heat flux, 2) maximize the mean value of the maximum achievable distance, and 3) minimize the variance of the maximum heat flux. The evolutionary part handles the system-design parameters of the vehicle and the uncertain functions, while the direct-transcription method generates optimal control profiles for the reentry trajectory of each individual of the population. During the optimization process, artificial neural networks are used to approximate the aerodynamic forces required by the direct-transcription method. The artificial neural networks are trained and updated by means of a multifidelity, evolution-control approach.",51,6
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051555,"The focus of this investigation is on the formulation and validation of a novel approach for the inclusion of uncertainty in the modeling of the boundary conditions of linear structures and of the coupling between linear substructures. This work is particularly relevant to complex structures assembled from simpler substructures as in aerospace applications. First, a mean structural dynamic model that includes boundary condition/coupling flexibility is obtained using classical substructuring concepts. The application of the nonparametric stochastic modeling approach to this mean model is next described and thus permits the consideration of both model and parameter uncertainty. Finally, the identification of the two parameters of this stochastic model, the mean boundary condition/coupling flexibility and the overall level of uncertainty, is shown and discussed. The methodology is demonstrated on three different structural dynamic models, of a rectangular plate and of two different wings.",51,6
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051609,"Far-field drag-prediction and decomposition methods are powerful tools that increase the accuracy of the drag coefficient computed from computational fluid dynamics results by removing the spurious drag caused by numerical procedures. Furthermore, these methods allow a physical decomposition of the drag in terms of viscous, wave, and induced drag. However, they are currently limited to steady flows. This paper presents a generalization of the commonly used drag-prediction and decomposition method to unsteady flows. This generalized method, designed for three-dimensional viscous, subsonic, and transonic flows, is defined for both inertial and noninertial coordinate systems and allows drag decomposition to be performed on either static or moving/rotating meshes. This generalization also allows the drag caused by the unsteady fluctuations of the flow to be identified.",51,6
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051667,"Many engineering systems contain uncertainties that cannot be described by either deterministic or probabilistic approaches. For example, the geometry, material properties, external actions (loads), and boundary conditions may be imprecise in a practical mechanical or structural system. The uncertainties present may be associated with parameters that are vague, imprecise, or linguistic. A fuzzy meshless local Petrov-Galerkin approach is developed in this work for the analysis of imprecisely defined systems. Starting from the basic concepts of fuzzy sets, fuzzy arithmetic, and fuzzy calculus (differentiation and integration) the various steps of the meshless local Petrov-Galerkin approach involved in the derivation of the equations are redefined using fuzzy concepts. The resulting fuzzy equations are derived using a fuzzy version of Gaussian elimination procedure coupled with truncation. A one-dimensional heat-transfer problem involving conduction, convection, and radiation with vaguely defined thermal properties of the material and boundary conditions and two stress-analysis problems (a beam and a plate with a hole) with vaguely defined material properties and external loads are considered to demonstrate the methodology. A truncation scheme is used to overcome the difficulty of overestimating the width of the response characteristics of the system due to repeated fuzzy arithmetic operations in the solution of the fuzzy equations. A simple sequential linearization scheme is used to handle the nonlinear boundary-value problem associated with the radiation boundary condition in the heat-transfer problem. The present approach represents a unique methodology that enables the handling of certain types of imprecisely known data more realistically compared to the existing procedures.",51,6
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051721,"We investigate two common approaches to model development for robust control synthesis in the aerospace community; namely, reduced-order aeroservoelastic modeling based on structural finite-element and computational-fluid-dynamics-based aerodynamic models and a data-driven system-identification procedure. It is shown via analysis of experimental SuperSonic SemiSpan Transport wind-tunnel data that, using a system-identification approach, it is possible to estimate a model at a fixed Mach number that is parsimonious and robust across varying dynamic pressures while the numerical reduced-order model offers significantly less predicative capability.",51,6
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051835,"Two optimization algorithms are presented that are capable of finding a global optimum in a computationally efficient manner: a gradient-based multistart algorithm based on Sobol sampling and a hybrid optimizer combining a genetic algorithm with a gradient-based algorithm. The optimizers are used to investigate multimodality in aerodynamic-shape-optimization problems. The performance of each algorithm is tested on an analytical test function as well as several aerodynamic-shape-optimization problems in two and three dimensions. In each problem the primary objectives are to classify the problem according to the degree of multimodality and to identify the preferred optimization algorithm for the problem. The results show that multimodality should not always be assumed in aerodynamic-shape-optimization problems. Typical two-dimensional airfoil-optimization problems are unimodal. Three-dimensional shape-optimization problems may contain local optima. The number of local optima tends to increase with increasing geometric degrees of freedom and design space bounds. For problems with a modest number of local optima, which we term somewhat multimodal, the gradient-based multistart Sobol algorithm is the most efficient method.",51,6
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051859,"A discrete adjoint-based design methodology for unsteady turbulent flows on three-dimensional dynamic overset unstructured grids is formulated, implemented, and verified. The methodology supports both compressible and incompressible flows and is amenable to massively parallel computing environments. The approach provides a general framework for performing highly efficient and discretely consistent sensitivity analysis for problems involving arbitrary combinations of overset unstructured grids that may be static, undergoing rigid or deforming motions, or any combination thereof. General parent–child motions are also accommodated, and the accuracy of the implementation is established using an independent verification based on a complex-variable approach. The methodology is used to demonstrate aerodynamic optimizations of a wind-turbine geometry, a biologically inspired flapping wing, and a complex helicopter configuration subject to trimming constraints. The objective function for each problem is successfully reduced, and all specified constraints are satisfied.",51,6
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051823,"A two-step approximate factorization technique for implementing a computationally stable nonlinear unsteady frequency-domain harmonic balance solution method within existing implicit computational fluid dynamic flow solver codes is presented. The approach uses an explicit discretization of the harmonic balance source term, and no new implicit code development is required. Both of these features enable the harmonic balance method to be implemented within existing implicit flow solver codes with minimal modification necessary to the underlying flow solver code. The resulting harmonic balance solver can then be used for modeling nonlinear periodic unsteady flows. The methodology is applied to the NASA OVERFLOW flow solver code, and results are presented for transonic viscous flow past an unsteady pitching airfoil section.",51,6
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052057,"In a previous paper, a novel approach to axisymmetric actuator-disk modeling was presented. In the present paper, this modeling is extended to include the case of a skewed flow, which is asymmetric. Similar to the axisymmetric case, it is assumed that the pressure difference between both sides of each point of the disk is a time average of the pressure difference between both sides of the blade elements that pass through the same point. The influence of the loaded disk on the flowfield is modeled by a distribution of sinks/sources over the disk plane. Closed-form integral expressions are obtained for the induced velocity through and upstream of the disk. By using Bernoulli’s equation, which relates between the flow far upstream and the flow just before crossing the disk plane, an additional nonlinear algebraic equation for the induced-velocity distribution over the disk is obtained. Discretization of the integral equations results in a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. An iterative procedure leads to the final solution. The model is efficient, stable, easy to apply, and solve. Comparisons with results of another method from the literature exhibit a very good agreement.",51,6
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052067,"This paper discusses the aero-optical environment for a flat-window hemisphere-on-cylinder turret over a wide range of viewing angles during flight tests in the Airborne Aero-Optics Laboratory. Aero-optical aberrations around the turret were measured using a high-speed Shack–Hartmann wave-front sensor providing an extensive aero-optical mapping. The primary data were acquired at Mach 0.5 at an altitude of 15,000 ft, with a subset of the data collected at Mach 0.4 for verification of scaling relationships. Data were acquired holding the relative position between two aircrafts constant. Additional data sets were acquired allowing two aircrafts to change their relative positions so that slewing data could be acquired; this provided statistical data over a large range of viewing angles between looking-forward to looking-back angles. Results were analyzed, and the aero-optical contribution from different flow features over the turret was identified and discussed. Cross-correlation functions and convective speed were also computed for some viewing angles and compared with other experiments. The flight-test data were also compared to wind-tunnel measurements using the identical turret.",51,6
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051778,"In this paper, a stabilized finite-element approach is used in the development of a high-order flow solver for compressible flows. The streamline/upwind Petrov–Galerkin discretization is used for the Navier–Stokes equations, and a fully implicit methodology is used for advancing the solution at each time step. The order of accuracy is assessed for both inviscid and viscous flows using the method of manufactured solutions. For two-dimensional flow, a mesh-curving strategy is discussed that allows high-aspect-ratio curved elements in viscous flow regions. In addition, the effects of curved elements are evaluated in two dimensions using the method of manufacture solutions. Finally, test cases are presented in two and three dimensions and compared with well-established results and/or experimental data.",51,6
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052104,"Calculations of the lift and lift-induced drag in steady incompressible high-Reynolds-number flows are proposed in terms of volume integration of the Lamb vector (cross product of the vorticity and the velocity vector). Although conventional far-field methods can compute the profile drag by the volume integral, induced drag is usually obtained by Maskell’s method, which requires a two-dimensional plane cut from three-dimensional data. Using the Lamb vector integration, plane data reconstruction is not necessary, and a definition of the lift-induced drag in viscous flows is obtained. Furthermore, an insight of the drag production is provided by the analysis of the Lamb vector field. Numerical solutions of the flow around arbitrary-shaped bodies can be analyzed by the present method. In particular, the analysis of an elliptic wing is here proposed. The acquired aerodynamic forces are evaluated in comparison with the results of classical methods.",51,6
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052118,"This work explores the interdependencies between the topological design of a compliant flapping mechanism and that of a flight-loaded elastic membrane-wing skeleton. This is done via a monolithic aeroelastic framework that encompasses the compliant-mechanism deformation, the motion of a flexible wing, and the transmission of aerodynamic and inertial forces back into the mechanism. A cellular-based evolutionary topology optimization scheme is used for mechanism design, wing design, or both simultaneously. The latter approach is shown to provide superior performance as this allows the tightly coupled nature of the two structures to be fully exploited. The results presented here also demonstrate potential issues that arise during wing design if the flapping kinematics are assumed to be prescribed. Finally, the mechanism topology is further improved via a gradient-based sizing/shape optimization to decrease actuator requirements as well as the time-dependent elastic stresses.",51,6
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052123,"A minimum-mass optimization strategy for variable-angle-tow panels subject to buckling and manufacturing constraints is presented. The optimization is performed using a fast-running optimization package that employs infinite-strip analysis for buckling and a gradient-based optimization method. A new variable-angle-tow-panel manufacturing method, continuous tow shearing, providing good quality, is considered in the optimization strategy where variable thickness occurs due to the shear deformation of dry tows. Optimum designs of variable-angle-tow panels are obtained and compared with panels without thickness variation. Different panel boundary conditions are investigated and discussed. The results show that boundary conditions have dramatic effects on optimum fiber paths. Over 20% mass saving is obtained for the optimization strategy with thickness variation compared with the design without thickness variation. The buckling strains are reduced to a practical level when the thickness variation is considered in the optimization. The buckling loads and mode shapes obtained from the infinite-strip method are in a good agreement with finite-element results. The optimization strategy provides structurally efficient solutions with good precision and low computational cost.",51,6
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052125,"This paper describes a new user-friendly hybrid surface mesh-generation method coupled with a modified hybrid volume mesh-generation method for viscous flow simulations. A suppressed marching-direction method is proposed to improve the quality of meshes at concave corners on surfaces and in volumes, such as aircraft wing–body junctions. Good-quality semistructured quadrilateral faces can be created around selected geometrical features with minimum user interventions using an advancing-layers-type method with a special treatment at concave corners. The hybrid volume mesh-generation method proposed by Ito et al. (Ito,Y., Shih, A. M., Soni, B. K., and Nakahashi, K., “Multiple Marching Direction Approach to Generate High Quality Hybrid Meshes,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2007, pp. 162–167 and Ito, Y., Shih, A. M., and Soni, B. K., “Hybrid Mesh Generation with Embedded Surfaces Using a Multiple Marching Direction Approach,” International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids, Vol. 67, No. 1, 2011, pp. 1–7) has also been modified so that it creates good-quality hexahedra along concave corners. Computational simulations have been performed using resulting meshes to demonstrate the capability of the new methods.",51,6
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052098,"The effects of steady slot suction as a means of controlling separation on a blunt elliptical airfoil were investigated and compared to the effects of steady blowing applied to the same airfoil previously investigated. Slots whose width approaches 1% of the chord and are located downstream of the natural separation location generate the highest lift for a given dimensionless mass-flow coefficient . This holds true whether the flow separates near the leading edge due to high incidence or near the trailing edge due to the bluntness of the airfoil and is contrary to the observations made when blowing was used. Lift generated by suction through a moderately wide slot located downstream of the natural separation line depends only on , but if the slot is located upstream of the separation line it depends on Reynolds number as well. Contrary to separation control by blowing no deleterious effects were observed at low levels of suction regardless of the suction-slot location. Adding a wedge to the blunt trailing edge of this airfoil enhances the effectiveness of suction, whereas making blowing less effective at low momentum inputs thus increasing the gap between these two approaches to flow separation.",51,6
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052142,"In order to identify the influence of large-scale freestream turbulence on the transient loads occurring over an airfoil, surface pressures were measured at various chordwise and spanwise stations over a thin flat–plate airfoil. The turbulence intensity was varied from nominally smooth flow conditions (1.2%) to 12.3% while the integral length scale ranged from 0.15 m up to 1.3 m. The individual influence of turbulence intensity and integral length scale on the transient lift, pressure drag, pitching and rolling moments experienced by the airfoil was identified from these representative turbulence conditions. Increase in turbulence intensity resulted in a significant increase in the magnitude of force and pitching moment fluctuations experienced by the airfoil. Similar to the effect of changing turbulence intensity, increase in integral length scale also rendered an increase in lift and pressure drag fluctuations. However the rolling moment fluctuations were smaller at longer length scales. While the increase in force fluctuations at longer length scales has been attributed to the higher peak energy present at lower frequencies at longer length scales, the reduction in rolling moment was due to the increased lateral correlation of the oncoming turbulent eddies.",51,6
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052138,"For airplane noise certification, noise measurements directly under the flight path, as well as at a lateral location, are required. Both azimuthal and flight effects are evaluated, with the aid of axisymmetric and realistic dual-stream nozzle geometries, in a controlled anechoic facility. The sound field is axisymmetric for dual-stream nozzles, both for simple and complicated internal geometries, as long as the exit plane is axisymmetric. In general, two effects are anticipated due to the presence of the pylon. The first effect pertains to the introduction of azimuthal variations in the spectra. Surprisingly, the sound field in the azimuthal angular range from to is axisymmetric except at very high engine power and low for which there is an increase in level at large aft angles. The second effect of the pylon pertains to modifications to the spectra, relative to those from an axisymmetric nozzle system. There is a noise reduction between and for the pylon nozzle at large aft angles and an increase of at the lower inlet angles. In general, the pylon effect is most pronounced at high engine power and gradually diminishes as engine power is lowered progressively. The following effects of forward flight have been established: 1) at the lower inlet angles, and up to 110 deg, the magnitude of the noise reduction due to forward flight is nearly uniform at all frequencies, at all velocity ratios and area ratios; 2) more complicated effects of forward flight are observed at large aft angles, which are a reduction at the lower frequencies and from to at the higher frequencies; 3) the area ratio plays no role at high but becomes important at lower .",51,6
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052191,"At Reynolds numbers approaching those of micro air vehicles (both engineered and natural), the Eppler 387 airfoil (in common with many other smooth profiles) can have multiple lift and drag states at a single wing-incidence angle. Prestall hysteresis and abrupt switching between stable states result from sudden flow reattachment and the appearance of a large separation bubble. It is shown that control of the dynamics can be achieved using external acoustic forcing. Separation control, hysteresis elimination, and more than 70% increase in lift–drag ratio are obtained at certain excitation frequencies and sound pressure levels. The global flow around the wing is effectively modified, and large, stable vortical structures appear in the separated shear layer. Correlation between the effects of acoustic excitation and wind-tunnel resonance shows that the antiresonances in an enclosed chamber correspond to the largest improvement in wing performance. Implications for control and stabilization of small aircraft inside and out of enclosed boxes are considered.",51,6
