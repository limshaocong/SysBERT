0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051838,"The near wake of a hitherto untried segmented blunt trailing-edge model has been investigated experimentally using a laser Doppler velocimeter. On the plain base of the model, trapezoidal prismatic blocks with symmetry about a transverse plane are attached along the model span at regular intervals, and they are arranged in two different fashions leaving a gap between them of a trapezoidal shape in one case and parallelogrammatic in another case. The spanwise discontinuity of this kind in the trailing edge not only imposes dislocation of spanwise vortices but also generates large-scale streamwise vortices, which effectively stabilize the periodic wake. The study ascertains that these novel “flush-mounted vortex generators” can be used when the application demands the streamwise vortices to penetrate in the wake of a parallel-sided bluff body.",51,11
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051896,"Determining the flutter boundaries for full aircraft configurations by time-accurately solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations is prohibitive with respect to computational expense, as the unsteady aerodynamic loading must be predicted for a wide range of flight conditions, frequencies, and structural mode shapes. Nonetheless, there is an increasing demand to accurately predict flutter boundaries in the viscous transonic regime—a demand, which, until recently, could only be satisfied by high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes methods. Brought to application readiness over the last years, time-linearized/small-disturbance methods, however, have been shown to satisfy this demand as well. They retain the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes method’s fidelity to a high degree, at a substantially reduced computational expense. Such a method is presented here on the basis of the TAU–Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes method. Denoted as the TAU linear-frequency-domain method, it is validated for both a standard transonic airfoil and a high-aspect-ratio-wing dynamic test case using rigid pitch modes. The response data obtained from the linear frequency domain are in good agreement with the experiment for a two-dimensional case. For the three-dimensional case, there are larger differences. More important, the linear-frequency-domain method is in excellent agreement to time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Depending on the linear-frequency-domain-employed-solution scheme, reductions in computational costs well beyond an order of magnitude are obtained. In addition, the limits of the so-called frozen-eddy-viscosity approach are established.",51,11
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052084,"A neurofuzzy system has been proposed to detect damage in a structure with multiple damage sites. A prestressed square membrane representing a gossamer structure has been taken as the example structure. Damage at various locations on the structure has been modeled as reduced stiffness. The structure undergoes transverse vibration under the action of a transverse dynamic pressure. Using the finite element package, “ABAQUS,” the strain histories at different sensor locations in the structure under the action of the transverse dynamic pressure were calculated. The vibration response of the structure has been decomposed into a set of subsignals using wavelet analysis to define a damage feature index vector, which has been used as an indicator of damage in the membrane. The neurofuzzy system accepts the wavelet-based damage feature index vector as the input and gives the damage status of the structure as the output.",51,11
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052207,"A physics-based empirical correlation between icing conditions and the corresponding drag coefficient was developed for NACA 0012 airfoils, and compared to other three existing prediction methods. The correlation was developed based on experimental aerodynamic databases of iced airfoils, and derived using statistical methods. The correlation model also provides drag coefficients for varying angles of attack for a given icing condition. The calculated drag coefficients resulted in 33.40% mean absolute deviation with respect to reference data from three different experimental databases. To validate the proposed degradation model and to further extend the database for helicopter-rotor performance degradation, rotating ice-accretion experiments were conducted. Four ice shapes obtained at the NASA Icing Research Tunnel were reproduced on a 53.34-cm-chord, 1.37-m-radius NACA 0012 rotor blade at the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand facility. Ice-shape molding and casting techniques were introduced to capture delicate ice features, such as ice feathers. The iced-airfoil castings were tested in a dry-air wind tunnel. The drag-coefficient comparison between the proposed analytical determination method and the experimental results from both rotor ice testing and icing-wind-tunnel testing showed to be satisfactory, ranging from 5 to 25% depending on the icing condition. The effect of ice feathers on drag degradation was investigated. Ice-feather formation can account for up to 25% of the drag introduced by ice accretion before stall.",51,11
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052184,"This paper presents a review of all existing discrete methods for computing the derivatives of computational models within a unified mathematical framework. This framework hinges on a new equation, the unifying chain rule, from which all the methods can be derived. The computation of derivatives is described as a two-step process: the evaluation of the partial derivatives and the computation of the total derivatives, which are dependent on the partial derivatives. Finite differences, the complex-step method, and symbolic differentiation are discussed as options for computing the partial derivatives. It is shown that these are building blocks with which the total derivatives can be assembled using algorithmic differentiation, the direct and adjoint methods, and coupled analytic methods for multidisciplinary systems. Each of these methods is presented and applied to a common numerical example to demonstrate and compare the various approaches. The paper ends with a discussion of current challenges and possible future research directions in this field.",51,11
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052241,"This paper describes an approach to periodic reference tracking in a pulsed-jet-injection experimental study. The objective was to match the jet’s temporal velocity profile to a periodic reference. The challenge lies in controlling the highly nonlinear and poorly understood dynamics associated with the jet velocity. Although the actuator maintains good authority over the jet velocity, the nonlinear jet dynamics creates a high degree of coupling among neighboring harmonics that depends on the forcing level and the desired waveform. The coupling is quantified by demodulating the jet-velocity measurement into baseband components centered at the harmonic frequencies represented in the desired waveform. An empirical input–output relationship is developed by perturbing the baseband components and measuring their effect on neighboring harmonics, and it is shown that this relationship can be modeled as a linear multi-input/multi-output system. This knowledge is exploited to create stabilizing feedback controls that asymptotically drive the jet velocity to the desired waveforms over a wide range of forcing conditions.",51,11
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052245,"Large-scale three-dimensional aerodynamic shape optimization based on the compressible Euler equations is considered. Shape calculus is used to derive an exact surface formulation of the gradients, enabling the computation of shape gradient information for each surface mesh node without having to calculate further mesh sensitivities. Special attention is paid to the applicability to large-scale three dimensional problems like the optimization of an Onera M6 wing or a complete blended-wing–body aircraft. The actual optimization is conducted in a one-shot fashion, in which the tangential Laplace operator is used as a Hessian approximation, thereby also preserving the regularity of the shape.",51,11
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052262,"A numerical-simulation tool is developed that is well suited for modeling the unsteady nonlinear aerodynamics of flying insects and small birds as well as biologically inspired flapping-wing micro air vehicles. The present numerical model is an extension of the widely used three-dimensional general unsteady vortex-lattice model and provides an attractive compromise between computational cost and fidelity. Moreover, it is ideally suited to be combined with computational structural dynamics to provide aeroelastic analyses. The present numerical results for a twisting, flapping wing with neither leading-edge nor wing-tip separations are in close agreement with the results obtained in previous studies with the Euler equations and a vortex-lattice method. The present results for unsteady lift, mean lift, and frequency content of the force are in good agreement with experimental data for the robofly apparatus. The actual wing motion of a hovering Drosophila is used to compute the flowfield and predict the lift force. The downward motion of the fluid particles revealed in the graphics of the calculated wake indicates the presence of lift. Moreover, the calculated mean lift is in close agreement with the weight of a Drosophila. The results presented in this paper definitely show that the interaction between vortices is the main feature that allows insects to generate enough lift to stay aloft. The present results warrant the use of this general version of the unsteady vortex-lattice method for future studies.",51,11
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052265,"A Reynolds stress relaxation model, specifically the lag Reynolds stress transport model, is applied to a wingtip vortex flow, and its performance is assessed and compared with other aerospace standard turbulence models. A Reynolds stress relaxation model allows for Reynolds stress history effects due to streamline curvature, which are seen to play an important role in the nondiffusive nature of turbulent vortices. This study shows that the lag Reynolds stress transport turbulence model is capable of predicting mean flow results as accurately as those of the well-performing Spalart–Allmaras model with correction for streamline curvature and system rotation. Furthermore, in this wingtip vortex flow, the lag Reynolds stress transport model predicts turbulence quantities more accurately than the rotation/curvature-corrected Spalart–Allmaras model. Although the lag Reynolds stress transport model well predicts this flow, it is more computationally intensive to solve than the rotation/curvature-corrected Spalart–Allmaras model, and it has some deficiencies, such as an inability to independently control the Reynolds stress magnitude and relaxation amount.",51,11
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052183,"Robust topology optimization has long been considered computationally intractable as it combines two highly expensive computational strategies. This paper considers simultaneous minimization of expectancy and variance of compliance in the presence of uncertainties in loading magnitude, using exact formulations and analytically derived sensitivities. It shows that only a few additional load cases are required, which scales in polynomial time with the number of uncertain load cases. The approach is implemented using the level set topology optimization method. Shape sensitivities are derived using the adjoint method. Several examples are used to investigate the effect of including variance in robust compliance optimization.",51,11
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052344,"This paper represents the results of an experimental study aimed at reducing the airfoil self-noise by the trailing-edge serration of four different sawtooth geometries (defined in the serration angle and length). These serrations have a common feature: all of the sawtooth patterns are cut directly into the trailing edge of a realistic airfoil. This configuration offers better structural strength and integrity. For the sawtooth trailing edges investigated here, the radiation of the extraneous vortex shedding noise in a narrowband frequency due to the partial bluntness at the serration roots is unavoidable. However, this narrowband component tends to be less significant provided that the serration angle is large and the serration length is moderate. Sound power was measured, and some of the sawtooth geometries have been shown to afford significant boundary-layer instability tonal noise and moderate turbulent broadband noise reductions across a fairly large velocity range. This paper demonstrates that a nonflat plate serrated trailing edge can also be effective in the self-noise reduction. Some experimental results are also presented in order to explain the self-noise mechanisms.",51,11
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052330,"An easy-to-interpret kinematic quantity measuring the average corotation of material line segments near a point is introduced and applied to vortex identification. At a given point, the vector of average corotation of line segments is defined as the average of the instantaneous local rigid-body rotation over “all planar cross sections” passing through the examined point. The vortex-identification method based on average corotation is a one-parameter, region-type local method sensitive to the axial stretching rate as well as to the inner configuration of the velocity gradient tensor. The method is derived from a well-defined interpretation of the local flow kinematics to determine the “plane of swirling” and is also applicable to compressible and variable-density flows. Practical application to direct numerical simulation datasets includes a hairpin vortex of boundary-layer transition, the reconnection process of two Burgers vortices, a flow around an inclined flat plate, and a flow around a revolving insect wing. The results agree well with some popular local methods and perform better in regions of strong shearing.",51,11
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052394,"A passive leading-edge treatment based on sinusoidal serrations aimed at reducing turbofan interaction noise has been recently studied in the framework of a European project (FLOCON). The turbulence-airfoil interaction mechanism is achieved using a turbulence grid located upstream of an isolated NACA airfoil tested in the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research anechoic open jet wind tunnel. The experimental setup with several airfoils designed and manufactured by ONERA is first presented with main acoustic results, highlighting the sound power level reductions obtained for all studied flow speeds (about 3–4 dB reduction) without altering the aerodynamic performances (as shown by available measurements and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculations). The experimental investigations are supplemented by numerical predictions in order to assess the acoustic performances of the serrations. The method described in the second part of the paper is based on a computational aeroacoustics code solving the nonlinear Euler equations applied to the disturbances and is coupled to a Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings formulation. Convection effects are achieved from a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solution or approximated by a fully uniform flow. The upstream turbulence is synthesized by means of a stochastic model and injected into the computational domain through an adapted boundary condition. It is first validated in two and three dimensions against academic flat-plate configurations by comparison with Amiet solutions (exact in such cases). Finally, three-dimensional computations are applied to FLOCON configurations. The present methodology is shown to reproduce the measured spectra and far-field directivities with a reasonably good precision. Radiated sound level attenuation due to the serrations versus frequency is fairly well assessed too.",51,11
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052425,"An alternative adaptive-optic controller, using both flow control and a phase-lock-loop control strategy, has been designed to overcome bandwidth limitations inhibiting current adaptive-optic controllers. A discrete-vortex code and weakly compressible model were used to simulate high-speed shear layer adaptive-optic corrections based upon the proposed phase-lock-loop controller given a range of upper and lower Mach numbers. The shear layer was forced at its origin, creating a region of regularized large-scale structures through which a simulated optical beam was projected. The controller applied a predicted conjugate correction to the shear layer’s emerging wavefront in a feedforward approach. The phase-lock-loop controller produces a sinusoidal signal for which the amplitude and phase are adjusted in real time to synchronize with the reference input. The controller is designed to track abrupt changes in phase or frequency. An overview of the design process is provided along with the alternative adaptive-optic controller’s basic layout and circuitry diagrams. Finally, experimental jitter results illustrate the controller’s amplitude and phase response capabilities given a purely sinusoidal function generator input signal.",51,11
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052542,"A fully passive flapping foil turbine was simulated using a two-dimensional Navier–Stokes solver with two-way fluid-structure interaction at a Reynolds number based on freestream flow and with a NACA 0012 foil. Both pitch angle and angle-of-attack control methodologies were investigated. Efficiencies of up to 30% based on the Betz criterion were found using pitch control, which is commensurate with values reported in the literature for prescribed motion studies. Nonsinusoidal foil pitching motions were found to be superior to sinusoidal motions. Efficiencies exceeding 41% were found using angle-of-attack control, and nonsinusoidal angle-of-attack profiles were found to be superior. The key to improving the efficiency of energy extraction from the flow is to control the timing of the formation and location of the leading-edge vortex at crucial times during the flapping cycle and the interaction of the vortex with the trailing edge. Simulations using Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence modeling suggest that the performance is maintained or only slightly reduced at .",51,11
