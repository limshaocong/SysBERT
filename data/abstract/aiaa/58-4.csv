We conducted experiments with thin panels in a high enthalpy flow environment in the arc-heated wind tunnel L3K. Time-resolved surface deformation and temperature fields were measured. The challenging digital image correlation (DIC) measurements through the flow field were validated by comparison to internal laser triangulation measurements. The resulting data set allows a detailed analysis of the coupling between thermal loads and structural deformation. We obtained severe localized heating and resulting deformations of more than 12 times the panel thickness. In addition to single exposure measurements, the effects of repeated load cycles were investigated.",58,4

Specifically, airfoil surface pressure coefficient and aerodynamic lift coefficient of a natural laminar flow wing are analyzed with uncertain PSP thickness distribution. The airfoil with PSP applied is parameterized by using a novel parameterization method based on radial basis function interpolation. As a characteristic of wing aerodynamic performance, is determined by surface pressure distribution, which can be affected by uncertainties of PSP binder thickness. A kriging response surface method has been used to develop a surrogate model to represent the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solution of the flow around the airfoil with PSP. This enables the use of Monte Carlo simulations to obtain stochastic output, including the probability of the occurrence of significantly inaccurate output values affected by the inputs subjecting to Gaussian distributions. An error margin and associated probability for its occurrence are recommended to account for uncertainties for the aerodynamic force occurring in the PSP measurement.",58,4

In this paper, a thin-film platinum/rhodioplatinum sensor array was built using microelectromechanical system technology on the surface of a nozzle guide vane, and a series of harsh tests was formulated and performed on these embedded sensors, such as vibrating and shocking tests, as well as an up to 1200°C high-pressure hot-gas turbine test. The sensor system (including the thin film and wire) is highly adherent and durable after the aforementioned tests, as well as the temperature cycling/shocking tests afterward, indicating that such thin-film sensors embedded on the vane surface are not only capable of detecting high temperatures but also able to stand for the tough working conditions in a propulsion environment of high vibration, violent shocking, and abrupt temperature stressing. These thin-film sensors are less than thick, and thereby more accurate as compared to a traditional wired thermocouple on the surface temperature measurements of turbine blades, serving the general engineering purpose for aeroengine research and development, as well as health monitoring.",58,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058367,"The transient response of a massively separated flow over an airfoil to rapid flap actuation is presented. A NACA 0006 airfoil is oriented at a fixed incidence of 20 deg for a Reynolds number of . The experiments are performed in a water tunnel with a wing spanning the width of the test section to produce a nominally two-dimensional flowfield. The airfoil is bisected about the midchord position, resulting in a 50%-chord trailing-edge flap. The flap is rapidly deflected in a smoothed-ramp profile over a range of deflection speeds and amplitudes. The flap maneuver is completed in a fraction of a single convective time. Focus is given to a deflection amplitude of 2 deg to minimize geometric deviation from the nondeflected configuration. The desired response to such a flap motion is the evocation of vortical transients conducive to lift enhancement. Through this study, two distinct transient responses are observed that are directionally dependent on flap actuation. In motions resulting in an increase in airfoil camber, the lift is increased instantaneously to modest values before relaxation to a separated steady state. In effect, this mode expedites convergence to the steady-state value of the final airfoil configuration and is devoid of the “antilift” spike associated with the discrete actuation of conventional fluidic actuators. In motions resulting in a decrease in airfoil camber, the lift profile is characterized by an initial reduction before a surge in lift, culminating in a global peak and followed by relaxation. Both deflection modes prove disruptive to the leading-edge shear-layer dynamics through trailing-edge actuation and are cause for rollup of a leading-edge vortex. Ridges of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field are used to determine that the net decrease in camber motion induces significant entrainment near the trailing edge, leading to a smaller recirculation region and reattachment of the flow above the suction surface trailing-edge region. The net increase in camber motion does not generate this entrainment, and therefore yields a significantly larger recirculation region.",58,4

The model is representative of an existing heavy-lift helicopter fuselage. The flowfield in correspondence of the loading ramp is investigated along both the longitudinal and transversal directions either at fixed incidence angle , 0°, and 4.5° or monotonically varying it in the range between . Two cases, that is, either without control or under the periodic excitation induced by PJs, have been considered. A statistical analysis of the case without control reveals the presence of a massive separation in the inspected region characterized by crosswise eddies, predominant at positive incidences, and streamwise vortices. Even though the separation mainly occurs slightly downstream the upsweep shape of the rear fuselage, two preferred reattachment regions are recognized either along the ramp or the boom tail for and 0°. When the incidence angle is increased, the separation points move upstream, and the reattachment points are predominantly located at the ramp end. The effectiveness of the control is achieved through a momentum addition of at a reduced frequency for the range of the investigated incidence angles. Benefits in aerodynamic performances result in a drag reduction from 5 to 24% for the incidence angle sweep. Under the periodic excitation, the separation is completely suppressed and the streamwise vortices move closer to the tail boom of the model. The vortical pattern preserves its symmetric spatial organization with respect to the longitudinal direction. A modal analysis using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) indicates the dominance of periodic crosswise vortical structures evolving along the ramp of the fuselage in phase with the control input. A phase-average reconstruction, based on the POD analysis, highlights that these vortices travel along the ramp and then dissipate by the time they reach the tail boom of the helicopter fuselage.",58,4

The compatibility equations including the unsteady terms are mathematically derived in the generalized curvilinear coordinates and then incorporated as boundary conditions (BCs) in a high-order accurate incompressible flow solver. The spatial derivative terms of the system of equations are discretized using the fourth-order compact finite difference (FD) scheme, consistent with the high-order accuracy required for the DNS. The time integration is carried out using an implicit dual time-stepping method, and the robustness and performance of the numerical algorithm are enhanced by applying the preconditioning technique and calculating the automated AC parameter based on the local flow conditions. At first, the steady viscous incompressible flow for a two-dimensional plane jet is computed to assess the accuracy and performance of the solution method by applying the UPCBCs in comparison with the simplified BCs. Then, the simulation of the unsteady incompressible viscous flow around a two-dimensional NACA0012 airfoil at the Reynolds number 800 and the angle of attack 20° is performed, and it is indicated that the computational cost of the solution is considerably decreased by implementing the UPCBCs at the artificial far-field boundary compared with the simplified BCs, which is remarkably valuable for the DNSs. Finally, the computation of the transition to unsteady for the incompressible flow around a three-dimensional NACA0012 wing at the same conditions of the two-dimensional case is successfully performed, and the results obtained are compared with those of previous studies that exhibit good agreement. Indications are that the present solution method by applying the UPCBCs at the artificial far-field boundary can be effectively used for the DNSs of the incompressible flows.",58,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058537,"This Paper presents a three-dimensional higher-order-accurate finite volume algorithm for the solution of steady-state compressible flow problems. Higher-order accuracy is achieved by constructing a piecewise continuous representation of the average solution values using the -exact reconstruction scheme. The pseudo-transient continuation method is employed to reduce the solution of the discretized system of nonlinear equations into the solution of a series of linear systems, which are subsequently solved using the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method. This Paper considers several preconditioning methods in conjunction with different matrix reordering algorithms and shows that the proposed preconditioner based on inner GMRES iterations can enhance the convergence speed and reduce the memory cost of the solver. Moreover, when starting from a lower-order solution as the initial condition, this Paper shows that ramping up the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number accelerates the convergence rate. Finally, this Paper verifies the developed finite volume algorithm by solving a set of test problems, in which optimal solution convergence with mesh refinement is attained.",58,4

To be compatible with computational fluid dynamics solvers, the underlying transition criterion is computed using three additional transport-type partial differential equations. A fourth equation is used in order to define laminar and turbulent regions inside the flowfield. The model was implemented in the finite-volume solver TAU of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It could be shown that a widely used transition transport model seems to exceed its range of validity for particular cases at high and low Reynolds numbers (for low turbulence intensities) depending on the pressure distribution. For the proposed model it is shown that for these cases transition onset can be predicted with the desired accuracy. To demonstrate this, computations of several 2D airfoils were performed, which show very good agreement with experimental data. Additionally, the applicability for industrially relevant weakly compressible 3D configurations and a compressible 3D wing–body configuration was shown achieving good agreement with experiments.",58,4

The model with and without the correction is implemented into two flow solvers and applied to four flows featuring separation. The length-scale correction increases the negative skin friction within separation bubbles and moves the reattachment point downstream. It remedies the unphysical backbending of streamlines near reattachment that has been observed with the original model.,58,4

The new approach uses anisotropic wavelet-based mesh refinement, and its effectiveness is demonstrated for flow simulations with two different turbulence models, namely, the Spalart–Allmaras and models for a variety of two- and three-dimensional flow configurations with arbitrary geometries, different speed regimes, and various boundary conditions. Supersonic plane channel flow, a weakly compressible channel flow with periodic hill constrictions, a subsonic zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary-layer flow, the separated flow over NASA wall-mounted hump, the Bachalo–Johnson flow (axisymmetric transonic bump flow), and a flow past a circular cylinder at a subcritical Reynolds number are tested as benchmark flows. The effectiveness and efficiency of the new wavelet-based approach are demonstrated by comparing the results of the WA-URANS simulations with literature data. This comprehensive validation of the WA-URANS approach encourages its application to practical problems of industrial interest, and demonstrates the feasibility of extending this approach to wavelet-based wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (LES) and hybrid URANS/LES. Finally, the current study serves as a baseline for the development of a unified hierarchical framework for eddy-resolving turbulence modeling, capable of performing computations of different fidelity, ranging from adaptive direct numerical simulations to adaptive URANS computations.",58,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059158,"Unstructured anisotropic mesh adaptation is known to be an efficient way to control discretization errors in computational fluid dynamics simulations. Method verification is required to provide the confidence for routine use in production analysis. The current work aims at verification of anisotropic mesh adaptation for Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations over the ONERA M6 wing. The present verification study is performed using four different flow solvers, three different implementations of the metric field, and three mesh mechanics packages. Two of the flow solvers use stabilized finite element discretizations (FUN3D-SFE and general geometry Navier–Stokes), one uses finite volume discretization (FUN3D-FV), and the last one uses mixed finite volume and finite element discretizations (Wolf). The mesh adaptation is based on an error estimator that aims to control the quadratic error term in the linear interpolation of the Mach number. Two sets of adaptations were performed; the first one controls the interpolation error in the norm, and the second one controls the interpolation error in the norm. Convergence studies were performed on the forces and the pitching moment using all four solvers, and the results are compared with previously verified convergence studies on fixed (nonadapted) meshes. Both the forces and pitching moment on adapted meshes are found to be converging to the fine-mesh values faster than those on fixed meshes. In addition to forces and moments, the convergence of surface pressure and skin-friction coefficients at various measurement locations on the wing are also presented. Adapted-mesh surface pressure distributions agree with the fine fixed mesh pressure distributions. Adapted-mesh skin-friction distributions contain high-frequency noise with mean values approaching the fixed mesh pressure skin-friction distributions.",58,4

The numerical virtual flight (NVF) simulation is a very useful and effective tool to analyze this kind of multiphysics problems. However, any computational-fluid-dynamics-based NVF solver should be verified and validated before engineering applications. In this work, the numerical virtual flight simulation platform Hybrid platform for engineering and research on FLOW - Numerical Virtual Flight System (HyperFLOW-NVFS), developed in our previous work (Zhang, L. P., Chang, X. H., Ma, R., Zhao, Z., and Wang, N. H., “A CFD-Based Numerical Virtual Flight Simulator and Its Application in Control Law Design of a Maneuverable Missile Model,” Chinese Journal of Aeronautics, Vol. 32, No. 12, 2019, pp. 2577–2591), is validated preliminarily by wind-tunnel virtual flight testing. A missile model is adopted to carry out virtual flight testing and numerical simulations. Three typical pitching-up maneuvering actions are tested to validate the capability of our NVF solver, including pitching up with a closed-loop attitude controller and an acceleration controller. The numerical results agree generally well with the experimental data, except for the states at a high angle of attack, which means that our NVF solver displays the potential for simulating complex multiphysics coupled problems.",58,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058426,"Here, a canonical model is proposed, which is able to represent the flow past a wing equipped with a pylon-mounted engine at low speed/moderate angle of attack. The vortices that develop past this model are described numerically and experimentally. For such configurations, the presence of a power-plant installation under the wing initiates a complex and unsteady vortical flowfield at the nacelle/pylon/wing junctions, responsible for a drop in aircraft performances. To gain insight into the underlying physics, the geometry is simplified into a symmetric two-dimensional extruded wing equipped with a symmetric, hemispheric-ended cylinder. The study was conducted at a Reynolds number of 200,000, based on the wing chord and on the freestream velocity. Two angle of attack angle configurations are investigated on the basis of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations, oil-flow visualizations, and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The vortex dynamics thus produced is described in terms of vortex core position, intensity, and size. The analysis of the velocity flowfields obtained from the wind-tunnel measurements and the numerical computations highlights the influence of the longitudinal vortex initiated at the pylon/wing junction on the separation process of the boundary layer near the upper-wing leading edge.",58,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058701,"In this paper, a two-dimensional integral boundary-layer method developed in a recent work is applied to ice-accretion computations. The method has already been validated in terms of boundary-layer dynamic effects in another paper. It is here validated for its ability to capture ice shapes, once the method is included in an icing suite. To be more specific, the results in using the new boundary-layer method are compared to experimental ice shapes and simulated ones with the widely used simplified integral method. The validation is carried out at an aggregated level because icing databases generally provide access to final ice shapes only. However, because the simplified integral method is used in many icing numerical tools, this comparison makes it possible to investigate the benefits of introducing the new method for calculating the boundary layer. The main outcome of the new method is an improvement of the prediction of the boundary-layer prediction under a smooth-wall assumption, which in turn improves ice-shape prediction. It is shown that, overall, the ice shapes are indeed either better predicted with the new method than with the baseline approach, or equally predicted with both methods. In addition, because the heat transfer coefficient tends to be underestimated by simplified integral methods, the new approach tends to predict lower horn angles than the baseline approach. Finally, the consequences of these results on current and future developments of ice-accretion solvers are discussed. In particular, the new method is better suited to a three-dimensional extension than the simplified integral method.",58,4

The OpenFOAM software library was used in the CFD simulation for the 0.6 m flat plate model. Both measurements and CFD simulations supported the assumption that the solitary waves dominating the flow-off process were kinematic, mass transporting, in nature.

Various computational techniques are discussed, as well as methods to extend the LES results to the acoustic far field. As the computational power increases and computational techniques mature, LES-based calculations are becoming more realistic by including complicated nozzle shapes and by increasing the Reynolds numbers to approach flight conditions. The LES is now being used for evaluation and the understanding of noise mechanisms from heated or unheated, subsonic or supersonic, and single or multiple jets (for example, twin jets). Also, impinging jets, jet blast deflector surfaces, installation effects, and noise reduction strategies (for example, fluidic injection, plasma actuators, chevrons, and beveled nozzles) are currently being studied and evaluated.

Measurements of axial thrust are acquired alongside surveys of the near-field acoustics at eight observer positions above and below the tip path plane of the upper rotor. The variables of interest are the index angle and stacking distance between the upper and lower rotors, as well as rotor speed. Standard metrics like thrust coefficient, sound pressure spectrum level, and the sound pressure level of the various blade harmonics and subharmonics are studied. Human ear effects are also considered using the A-weighting standard, which is shown to have a profound influence on the perceived noise levels. The analysis demonstrates how rotor thrust and sound pressure levels are more dependent on rotor index angle than stacking distance. However, the index angle where the peak thrust coefficient resides is more sensitive to stacking distance at low rotation speeds than it is at high rotation speeds. Various rotor speed and index angle combinations of the stacked rotor are also shown to produce the same rotor thrust, all the while resulting in uniquely different sound levels of the various rotor harmonics.",58,4

These facilities are able to replicate the total enthalpy and pressures experienced along hypersonic flight trajectories. Designing the relevant operating conditions is complex, and extensive guidance about operation condition design in reflected shock tunnels is scarce. To facilitate the operation of a reflected shock tunnel, it may be advantageous to develop a database of attainable conditions and the operation parameters required to achieve them. For this, a model to calculate global thermodynamic states and shock speeds also accounting for piston location and tube length (quasi-0D-model) is proposed. This model uses the NASA Chemical Equilibrium with Applications code to solve real gas and high-temperature effects. A number of conditions are calculated to produce maps of operating conditions. As test cases, the reflected shock tunnel under development at Tokai University, and T4 at the University of Queensland are used. Maps obtained sweeping rupture pressure or compression ratio, and initial test gas pressure for different driver compositions are presented. This methodology can be adapted to similar facilities. Moreover, observation of the presented maps provides a quick reference of the influence of each parameter when modifying existing conditions or fine-tuning tunnel operation.",58,4

Their variations under increasing ramp angles and Reynolds numbers are further examined. The low-frequency shock-wave oscillations are also studied through tracking the shock-wave motion.

For the aft angle of , the three-dimensionality effects are negligible. As the aft angle exceeds 50°, the vortical structures that align in the streamwise direction start to emerge and strengthen over the surfaces of the aft wedge. The characteristic signs of Görtler vortices, distinct striations, also become apparent in the contours of heat flux, density gradient, and pressure on the surfaces of the aft wedge for those cases. The presence of vortical structures enhances heat transfer from the surfaces and together with relieving effects breaks the symmetry down in the flowfield.

In this environment, high levels of aerodynamic heating are encountered such that incorporation of chemical and vibrational nonequilibrium effects can become critical. The impact of thermal nonequilibrium (TNE) on the supersonic mode in particular has not been thoroughly and systematically investigated. This work uses thermochemical nonequilibrium (TCNE) direct numerical simulation (DNS) and TCNE linear stability theory (LST) to obtain a more complete investigation of the supersonic mode using both nonequilibrium and frozen gas models. The simulation is Mach 5 flow over a 1-mm-nose-radius axisymmetric cone 1 m in length, representative of experimental conditions in ground test facilities. Both LST and DNS results indicate that TNE effects are destabilizing compared with frozen flow and can lead to an -factor difference of approximately at the end of the cone. LST results also indicate that TNE effects are stabilizing to the second and supersonic modes in comparison with thermal equilibrium. The supersonic mode appeared to be slightly more affected by TNE than the second mode. Collectively, the findings in this work suggest that even in ground test facilities where TCNE effects are relatively small compared with free flight, incorporating nonequilibrium models in both the mean flow and stability solvers can have a practical effect on hypersonic boundary-layer transition prediction analyses.",58,4

From these sparse grid LES realizations, a surrogate model of mean flow quantities (temperature, velocity, etc.) is computed for calculation of parameter space statistics. This study shows that the explicit-filtering simulations exhibit a magnified sensitivity to modeling parameters relative to the implicit-filtering simulations. These increased sensitivities manifest most prominently in the temperature field, with certain parameter sets quenching the flame in explicit-filtering simulations but not in the implicit-filtering simulations.

The results from the detailed model are compared to two-dimensional and three-dimensional burning-rate codes with reduced chemistry. The gas-phase combustion chemistry is modeled using a reduced four-step mechanism developed from a detailed microscale model of ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene combustion. Simple configurations of a single ammonium perchlorate particle and sandwich propellants at varying pressures are compared to determine leading-order effects of two-dimensional and three-dimensional approaches.

For efficient reliability analysis of structure in presence of hybrid random and evidence uncertainties (RA-HRE), a single-layer sampling method (SLSM) is proposed. First, two equivalent expectation formulas are derived for the belief and the plausibility measures in RA-HRE. According to these formulas, the belief and the plausibility measures can be directly estimated by only one group of samples of the random variables and focal elements of the evidence variables that are generated at the same level. Second, for greatly reducing the computational cost in RA-HRE by SLSM, the SLSM-based bi-objective adaptive kriging (SLSM-BAK) is subsequently developed to simultaneously estimate the belief and the plausibility measures. Aiming at the two objectives in RA-HRE, that is, accurately estimating the belief and the plausibility measures, a new compound learning function is developed in SLSM-BAK. Based on the compound learning function, the kriging model is adaptively updated to accurately and efficiently recognize the sign of the maximum and minimum performance functions for each random sample over the corresponding sampled focal element.

As the most influential method developed thus far, the effective independence (EI) method for sensor placement is discussed extensively in the present paper. Specifically, it was observed that, in the computation of the EI index, the sum of each retained row in the eigenvalue contribution matrix is a constant during each iteration. To reveal the significance of this property, a matrix transformation was employed, the form of which is similar to the orthogonal-triangular (QR) decomposition of the EI method previously proposed by the authors. In this regard, the physical significance of the re-orthogonalization of the modes through QR decomposition based on the computation of the EI method can be clearly seen from a new perspective. In view of this, a new sensor placement method, which is referred to as the remodeling innovation (RI) method, is proposed in this paper. The RI method avoids the existing problems in a conventional EI method in that, during each iterative calculation, the row with the least norm is removed without taking into account the effects of the structural mass redistribution. Furthermore, the RI method achieves better sensor placement in terms of the different evaluation criteria applied. Finally, to demonstrate the above observations, the proposed RI method was applied to the Hangzhou Nanshan Bridge.",58,4

Estimating the flutter boundary in the presence of nonlinear aerodynamic phenomena is challenging because high-fidelity aeroelastic models are expensive to evaluate, and flutter analysis requires many model evaluations. On the other hand, relatively inexpensive approximate aeroelastic models (low-fidelity models) exist and are routinely applied to reduce the cost of estimating flutter, albeit with lower accuracy. The multifidelity method introduced here uses an active learning algorithm to leverage information from low-fidelity models. A multifidelity statistical surrogate is used to fit damping coefficient estimates computed with different aeroelastic models. This surrogate is used to estimate the uncertainty in the prediction of the flutter boundary, which drives the selection of new evaluations. The effectiveness of the multifidelity method is demonstrated by estimating the aeroelastic flutter boundary of a typical section model at a cost 85% lower when compared with the bisection method. Four aeroelastic models are considered in this example: three models (including the high-fidelity model) use a computational fluid dynamics solver based on the Euler equations, whereas one model uses a two-dimensional doublet-lattice method.",58,4

Three key obstacles have been identified. With two of them being resolved recently, the present paper addressed the remaining one, namely, the efficient solution of the second-order perturbation equation. A closed-form solution is obtained, which is more computationally efficient than any approach adopted in the past. The closed-form solution is obtained mathematically rigorously, and in the meantime it is computational efficient. The approach applies also to problems where buckling is of multiple modes. The solution procedure established in this paper has been verified and demonstrated through a structural application.",58,4
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058686,"The dynamic response of thin-walled structures is driven by mass and stiffness distribution. As such, variable-stiffness (VS) composites offer opportunities to tune structural dynamic responses. To this extent, efficient analysis tools become increasingly important for structural analysis and design purposes. In this work, an efficient and versatile Ritz method for free vibrations and linear transient analysis of VS doubly curved shell structures is presented. VS shell structures are modeled as an assembly of shell-like domains. The shell kinematics is based on the first-order shear deformation theory, and no further assumption is made on the shallowness or on the thinness of the structure. The description of the shell is provided by a rational Bézier surface representation, and general surface geometries can be represented. Legendre polynomials are employed to approximate the displacement field, and penalty techniques are used to enforce displacement continuity and kinematical boundary conditions. Classical Rayleigh damping is considered, and solutions are obtained through the Newmark integration. The resulting model allows a wide range of configurations and load cases for multicomponent, VS composite structures to be solved, providing the same levels of accuracy as finite element analysis, yet with a reduced number of variables and simpler data preparation.",58,4
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058751,"Nonsymmetric laminates are commonly precluded from composite design due to perceptions of reduced performance arising from in- and out-of-plane coupling. This coupling introduces warpage during cure—leading to raised stresses, together with diminished buckling and load carrying capacity. However, these reduced performance characteristics are rarely quantified and included in the design process; instead the symmetric-only paradigm remains pervasive at the cost of a significantly reduced design space. Warpage is largely driven by mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion between sublaminates located above and below the midplane and can be predicted by the classical laminate theory. Acknowledging that all symmetric laminates in multipart structures have build stresses from assembly, it is proposed that subsets of nonsymmetric laminates that translate to similar raised stress levels be considered for design. Challenging this symmetric-only design paradigm would permit greater design freedom and offer new routes to elastically tailor composite structures. Further analysis of structural performance is assessed in terms of reduced loading and buckling capacity.",58,4

Whereas the elasticity equations for simply supported plates are solved by using Srivinas and Rao’s approach, the TSNDT equations are numerically solved by using weighted Jacobi polynomials and the Ritz method. We note that previous studies have generally compared only the fundamental frequency. For square laminates with a side-length/plate-thickness ratio of 100 (10), the maximum error in the TSNDT predicted first 12 frequencies is less than 0.4% (7%). For a FCSR less than 20, the maximum difference in predictions from the two approaches for the first six distinct frequencies is 5.4%. However, the FCDR has little effect on the difference between frequencies from the two methods. The frequencies and mode shapes presented herein should help us better understand the dynamic behavior of laminated and sandwich plates and provide benchmark results for others to assess their theories.",58,4
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058415,"A decomposition strategy for the structural optimization of a fiber-reinforced aircraft wing box is proposed. The proposed method decomposes the wing-box optimization into two levels: a system-level and a subsystem-level optimization. The ribs are the subsystems of the problem. Each rib has a local set of design variables and constraints. The loads on the ribs are the crushing loads caused by the bending of the wing. At the system level, the wing-box skins are optimized while accounting for the effect of the skin design on the loads applied to the ribs. The sensitivity of the rib mass to the applied loads is evaluated using the Lagrange multipliers of the optimized rib design. To enhance the numerical efficiency of the two-level optimization, the changes of the loads on the ribs are subjected to a reduction by principal component analysis (PCA). In both the wing-level and rib-level optimization problems, the level-set strategy for the optimization of composite structures, previously introduced by the authors, is employed. This method permits an advantageous use of coarse and fine finite element models employing a standard commercial finite element code. The proposed method is applied to the design of a composite horizontal tail plane. The accuracy of and the computational time savings by the proposed PCA-based reduction scheme are quantified.",58,4
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058647,"The equivalent modeling approach is one of the key technologies in the design of vibration controllers motivated by the large flexible space truss structure applications. Based on the energy equivalence principle and the classical Timoshenko beam theory, this study establishes a new equivalent dynamic model for the space antenna truss with initial stress by the static condensation method. Compared with previous truss structures of the triangular prism reported in equivalent modeling, the space antenna truss has a more complicated configuration and more members. Meanwhile, this truss structure is in a self-stress state and the connection of the adjacent members is a rigid-jointed. The equivalent anisotropic Timoshenko beam model of the complex space antenna truss with a rigid joints is proposed for the spatial repeating element composed of the beam and cable members in the initial stress state and the joints. According to the kinematic assumptions, displacement expressions of the spatial repeating element are derived using the Taylor series expansion at the center of the spatial repeating element. Then, the stiffness and mass matrices of the equivalent beam model are obtained. The natural vibration characteristics of the equivalent beam model are proved to be in good agreement with those of the original space antenna truss, which indicates that the equivalent beam model has a satisfactory accuracy. As a result, the equivalent dynamic model may serve for the vibration control of the space antenna truss.",58,4
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058807,"The composite kernel learning (CKL) method is introduced to efficiently construct composite kernels for Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models with applications in engineering design. The mixture of kernel functions is cast as a weighted-sum model in which the weights are treated as extra hyperparameters to yield a higher optimum likelihood. The CKL framework aims to improve the accuracy of the GP and relieves the difficulty of kernel selection. In this paper, the combination of five kernel functions are studied, namely, Gaussian, Matérn-3/2, Matérn-5/2, exponential, and cubic, with each kernel sharing the same length scale. Numerical studies were performed on a set of engineering problems to assess the approximation capability of GP-CKL. The results show that, in general, GP-CKL yields a lower approximation error and higher robustness as compared to GP models with single kernel and model selection methods. Numerical experiments show that it is worth using the GP-CKL method for achieving higher accuracy with extra burdens on the number of hyperparameters and a longer training time. Besides, experiments were also performed with variable length scales for each kernel and each variable. However, this variant of CKL is not suggested because it is prone to overfitting and is significantly more expensive than the other GP variants.",58,4
