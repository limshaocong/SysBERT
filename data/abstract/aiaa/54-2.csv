Current state-of-the-art flow solvers encounter difficulties in predicting both the onset of flow separation over similar configurations and the progression of the separated region when the angle of attack is increased. The present analysis provides useful insights into the mechanisms responsible for limiting the maximum lift on multielement wing configurations by relating flow separation with the onset of flow instability. A steady solution based on a finite volume discretization is used as the basic state for the linear stability analysis. The resulting generalized eigenvalue problem has been solved using a Krylov subspace projection technique in the form of the Arnoldi iterative method. This methodology is first applied to a NACA0012 test case at subsonic and transonic conditions. Then, for the first time, the stability of flow over an industrial multicomponent geometry involving the A310 airfoil has been investigated in order to identify the low-frequency instabilities related to flow separation. One important conclusion is that, for both configurations, one unstable mode related to flow separation appears at an angle of attack greater than that corresponding to the maximum lift coefficient condition. Finally, the adjoint problem is solved in order to evaluate the receptivity characteristics and the structural sensitivity of both configurations, identifying the regions of flow that can be manipulated to yield the largest change in the flowfield.",54,2

Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations and experimental data are compared for a Reynolds number based on the wing chord equal to and an angle of attack of 12 deg. The flat plate and wing boundary layers are fully turbulent, and the Reynolds number based on the momentum thickness of the incoming boundary layer is equal to . It is shown that the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation using the Spalart–Allmaras model with the Boussinesq closure predicts a massive corner flow separation, whereas on the experimental side, the separation is confined to a small area. Better predictions are obtained when resorting to the Spalart–Allmaras model with the quadratic constitutive relation closure. A comprehensive investigation of the numerical results using the experimental data is performed to get a better understanding of the behavior of the Spalart–Allmaras quadratic constitutive relation model for the present corner flow.",54,2

The robustness and stability of the optical design necessitated by the dynamic vibrational and thermal environment were balanced against the need for compact size and very high signal-to-noise ratio in a low-pressure, high-altitude flight regime.

In this study, the relationship was examined in a forced-convective environment using methanol as a liquid fuel. The gas-phase temperature profiles across the laminar boundary layer with a methanol diffusion flame established over it were measured with the freestream air flowing parallel to the condensed fuel surface. Local and averaged mass burning rates were measured along with shear stresses at the fuel surface. The fuel consumption rate and flame lengths were observed to increase monotonically with an increase in the freestream velocity. Although the initial study was taken in the laminar regime, further extensions of the technique could be applicable to turbulent boundary-layer combustion in propulsion-oriented research.",54,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054538,Comparative studies of different inflow turbulent forcing effects on detonation front dynamics and the flow statistics are conducted through direct numerical simulations of turbulence–detonation/shock interactions. High-resolution bandwidth-optimized weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme of spatial discretization and total variation diminishing temporal integration are used to solve the three-dimensional chemically reactive Navier–Stokes equations. The turbulent inflow vertical and entropic forcing effects on the three-dimensional detonation front and cellular structures are first analyzed. The influence of the inflow forcing on the generated regular cell patterns with diamond shape is compared. The vortex behind the detonation is quite different from that behind shock waves with the same inflow fluctuations. This also results in the larger increase of velocity variances downstream of detonation than the turbulence–shock case. The similar trend can also be found for the Taylor microscales. Effects of different inflow turbulence intensities are investigated. The irregular cellular detonations under vertical inflow forcing are also analyzed.,54,2

Pressure-sensitive paint technique is used with nozzles of different design Mach numbers in the range 1.4–2.8. Nozzle pressure ratios in the range of 1.12–4.91, corresponding to a “jet Mach number” range of 0.4–1.7 and a Reynolds number range of –, are covered in the experiment. As it is well-known, one-dimensional nozzle flow theory grossly overpredicts the throat-to-shock-location distance at a given nozzle pressure ratio. A correlation from the literature based on rocket nozzle databases is also found to be inadequate for these nozzles of lower design Mach number typical of aircraft applications. For the parametric range covered, a simple correlation for the shock location distance is found. All data collapse in a cluster when plotted as a function of the ratio of jet Mach number to design Mach number. A curve-fit equation representing the average trend is provided.",54,2

Experiments are carried out in a Ludwieg-type wind tunnel at Mach numbers of , 6, and 8 and Reynolds numbers from to at turbulent, transitional, and laminar boundary layers on the plate in front of the fins. Panoramic optical methods are used for measurements of heat flux and pressure. Flow visualization is done as well. It is shown that even a small blunting of the plate leading edge considerably changes the heat transfer, pressure, and shear-stress distributions at the shock wave/boundary-layer interactions; and, under certain conditions, it causes changes of the flow structure.",54,2

Effects of chemistry and wall temperature on the flow in the base region, at low to high enthalpies, are discussed. The experiments were conducted in a shock tunnel at a nominal Mach number of 10. Freestream Reynolds numbers based on cylinder diameter were and , respectively, and the total specific enthalpies were 13.35 and , respectively. The test gas was air. The surface pressure and heat flux were measured using a cold wall model. Equilibrium and thermal as well as chemical nonequilibrium numerical simulations were performed using a Navier–Stokes equations-based computational fluid dynamics code. Both a cold wall and adiabatic wall were considered. Particular emphasis was placed on the wake structure, vorticity distribution, wake centerline aerothermodynamic properties, and surface data. The existing low-enthalpy cold hypersonic wind-tunnel experimental data are included for comparison. The simulations predicted the effect of chemistry on the near wake to be negligible for the low-enthalpy, high Reynolds number flow but more significant for the high-enthalpy, low Reynolds number flow.",54,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053479,"This study presents hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulations of the unsteady flow and noise-generation phenomena in the slat cove of a high-lift wing profile. These computations are part of a joint numerical/experimental aeroacoustics collaborative program dedicated to slat-flow analysis. A dedicated two-element wing profile (slat plus main body) has been designed to isolate slat noise from other possible sources (e.g., the flap), while minimizing mean flow deflection effects, to improve the fidelity of open-jet wind-tunnel measurements. The design of this two-element airfoil has been performed numerically, using an optimization process based on steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculations. This airfoil has been investigated experimentally at the École Centrale de Lyon open jet facility. Unsteady zonal hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulations have been performed to provide a comprehensive description of the unsteady flow inside the slat cove, focusing on the noise-generation processes. A detailed analysis of the physics of the unsteady flow inside the slat cove is presented as well as a comparison of numerical results with available experimental data. The pressure spectra associated with the slat-cove flow are characterized by several tonal peaks emerging from the underlying broadband content. The existence of such peaks is attributed to a feedback loop involving the main shear layer inside the slat cove. A theoretical law is proposed to predict the associated tonal frequencies and assessed at the end of the paper.",54,2

The Weber number has a significant influence on the drag properties of the round drops; however, the effect of the Ohnesorge number is small.

10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054181,"In this article, recent developments in numerical methods for performing a large-eddy simulation of the formation and evolution of a wingtip vortex are presented. The development of these vortices in the near wake, in combination with the large Reynolds numbers present in these cases, makes these types of test cases particularly challenging to investigate numerically. First, an overview is given of the spectral vanishing viscosity/implicit large-eddy simulation solver that is used to perform the simulations, and techniques are highlighted that have been adopted to solve various numerical issues that arise when studying such cases. To demonstrate the method’s viability, results are presented from numerical simulations of flow over a NACA 0012 profile wingtip at and they are compared against experimental data, which is to date the highest Reynolds number achieved for a large-eddy simulation that has been correlated with experiments for this test case. The model in this paper correlates favorably with experiment, both for the characteristic jetting in the primary vortex and pressure distribution on the wing surface. The proposed method is of general interest for the modeling of transitioning vortex-dominated flows over complex geometries.",54,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054422,"Experiments were conducted on a rectangular flat plate wing at high incidence to compare the force production and leading-edge vortex location and strength as a function of time for eight sets of wing kinematics: rectilinear and rotational pitch and surge, with fast and slow accelerations. The primary differences observed in the force histories were between the pitch and surge cases, and they occurred during the acceleration or pitching portions of the motions. The force histories were found to be similar between the rectilinear and rotational cases. The leading-edge vortex trajectories in the rectilinear cases were found to be similar when compared on a new time scale , related to the integrated leading-edge-normal velocity. The vortex trajectory of the rotational cases matched those of the rectilinear cases until the leading-edge vortex in the rotational case settled into a position attached to the wing. Circulation values of the leading-edge vortex for all cases were found to collapse when plotted versus and scaled by the instantaneous leading-edge-normal velocity. The results demonstrate a successful collapse of both vortex quantities and force production using only leading-edge kinematics.",54,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054128,"A computationally efficient procedure for multiobjective design optimization with variable-fidelity models and response surface surrogates is presented. The proposed approach uses the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that works with a fast surrogate model, obtained with kriging interpolation of the low-fidelity model data enhanced by space-mapping correction exploiting a few high-fidelity training points. The initial Pareto front generated by multiobjective optimization of the surrogate using the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm can be iteratively refined by local enhancements of the surrogate model. The latter are realized with a space-mapping response correction based on a limited number of high-fidelity training points allocated along the initial Pareto front. The proposed method allows us to obtain, at a low computational cost, a set of designs representing tradeoffs between the conflicting objectives. The current approach is illustrated using examples of airfoil design: one in transonic flow, involving aerodynamics tradeoffs; and another one in low-speed flow, involving tradeoffs between the aerodynamic and the aeroacoustic performances.",54,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054295,"This paper focuses on the development of a surface mesh movement algorithm suitable for computer-aided-design-based aerodynamic shape optimization. The algorithm interrogates the computer-aided-design system via the vendor-neutral application programming interface Computational Analysis Programming Interface and uses the Computational Analysis Programming Interface’s watertight triangulation of a modified computer-aided-design geometry to guide the movement of the structured surface mesh as the geometry changes during the optimization process. A mapping procedure is introduced that not only preserves the characteristics of the original surface mesh but also guarantees that the new mesh points are on the computer-aided-design geometry. The deformed surface mesh is then smoothed in the parametric space before it is transformed back into three-dimensional space. The procedure is efficient, in that all the processing is done in the parametric space, incurring minimal computational cost. The mesh movement tool is integrated into a three-dimensional shape-optimization framework, with a linear-elasticity volume-mesh movement algorithm, a Newton–Krylov flow solver for the Euler equations, and a discrete-adjoint gradient-based optimizer. The accuracy of the computed gradients is verified through a number of examples.",54,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054370,"The present paper presents a technique to estimate spectra from experimental data sampled at discrete points in time. The interest of the current paper is to investigate spatiotemporal dependencies in supersonic turbulent flows like boundary layers and shock wave/turbulent boundary-layer interactions. The experimental data are measured by means of a dual-particle-image-velocimetry system that gives access to a certain amount of temporal information that is also in high-speed flows. The cross-correlation information in space made available by the dual-particle-image-velocimetry system can be used to reconstruct the autocorrelation for delay times ranging between the discrete points measured with the dual-particle-image-velocimetry system. This can be achieved for convection-dominated regions of the flow by moving into the convected frame of reference: similar to Taylor’s hypothesis. The principle and suitability of the suggested technique is demonstrated in a combined numerical–experimental approach. The large-eddy simulations give access to fully time-resolved data and can thus be used to verify the accuracy of the autocorrelation and spectra estimated from experimental data. Also, the choice of time delays for the measurements can be optimized based on the numerical results.",54,2

Static pressure, unsteady surface pressure, and velocity measurements were made throughout the trailing-edge region of an airfoil model with three interchangeable, symmetric trailing-edge sections. The data of the present study were used to develop a new model for estimation of fluctuating surface pressure autospectra beneath two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer flow experiencing an adverse pressure gradient of variable strength. This new model has been used to compare with data from six separate experimental investigations from literature, and has been compared against a separately developed empirical model of the fluctuating surface pressure. Additional empirical modeling of the coherent extents of the fluctuating pressure field in the longitudinal and lateral directions, as well as the convection velocity, is presented as a function of nondimensional variables dependent on the adverse pressure gradient flow condition.",54,2

The effects of flapping frequency and wing geometry on force generation were examined using a miniature six-component force sensor. Additional high-speed imaging allowed identification of the notable different deformation characteristics of the flexible wings under vacuum condition in comparison to their behavior in air, illustrating the relevance of aeroelastic effects. Flow visualization around the flapping wing by means of planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements revealed the formation, development, and shedding of the vortical structures by the wings during flapping motion, with particular emphasis on the clap-and-fling phase. Further stereoscopic PIV measurements performed in the wake showed a momentum surplus wake induced by the clap-and-fling, indicative of thrust generation. The vortical structures in the wake formed during instroke and outstroke were characterized using a three-dimensional wake reconstruction from the planar measurements.",54,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054425,"Visualization of acoustic pressure and acoustic velocity field and computation of acoustic power are meaningful to investigate noise radiation and propagation mechanism of turbomachines. However, the conventional surface integral method is very time-consuming because the acoustic response for numerous source–observer pairs should be numerically computed one by one. This paper presents an accelerated method for predicting acoustic pressure and acoustic velocity in the acoustic far field radiated by rotating sources. The accelerated method is derived based on a spherical harmonic series expansion method, which explicitly describes the variation of the acoustic pressure and acoustic velocity with the radial coordinate and azimuthal angle of the observer in acoustic far field. In the proposed accelerated method, only the acoustic pressure of a few reference observer points with different polar angles is directly computed by numerical integration, whereas the acoustic pressure and acoustic velocity of the other observers are fast computed using the interpolation method. Moreover, an accelerated method for computing the acoustic power is also developed, which avoids both the numerical integral of the observer surface and computation of the acoustic velocity. Numerical illustrations indicate that the accelerated method has a good accuracy and is more efficient than the conventional numerical integral method.",54,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054030,"The SIMPLE family of algorithms has popularized the pressure-based schemes for incompressible flows and is the basis of many commercial codes. The influence of pressure on velocity is of primary importance in incompressible flows. The continuity equation implicitly dictates the pressure field, yet pressure is not a variable of the mass conservation equation. The pressure term that appears in the momentum equations is often treated as a source term. Thus, there is no explicit conservation equation for pressure. This predicament, and its remedy well known by the name “pressure–velocity coupling,” is resolved in SIMPLE and its variants by obtaining an approximate pressure correction field, which is used iteratively to correct the velocity field and/or the pressure field, seeking an overall satisfaction of the conservation equations. The approximate nature of the pressure correction equation often causes convergence issues. A new algorithm is presented here, eliminating the need for the pressure correction equation, based on the fact that if the pressure field is known, the momentum equations can be solved in any number of ways to obtain the velocity field correctly. An exact equation for the pressure field is obtained by manipulating the discretized mass and momentum equations based on SIMPLER, which is the only nonlinear equation solved iteratively in the new algorithm (RK-SIMPLER). The momentum equations are cast in the form of an ordinary differential equation suitable for time integration using Runge–Kutta stages. Once the pressure field is known, the velocity field is updated explicitly every time step without iteratively solving the momentum equations. This also means that there are no subiterations within a time step. In addition, there are no corrections for the pressure or the velocity field, and hence there is no need for the approximate pressure correction equation. The RK-SIMPLER algorithm proves that, for incompressible flows, the fundamental equation is the pressure–velocity coupled exact equation for pressure and that there is no need for the nonlinear velocity equations to be solved iteratively. Also, the new algorithm presented here uses only exact equations and requires neither underrelaxation for any of the discretized quations nor subiterations for the time integration. The only approximation is that the pressure field is held constant through the Runge–Kutta update of the velocity field. The RK-SIMPLER algorithm converges well and captures the unsteady flow features for the cases analyzed. In contrast, for steady flows, the algorithm is stable but less competitive compared to unsteady flow simulations in terms of CPU time, due to the restrictions on the allowable time step.",54,2

This work investigates the characteristics of the vortex interactions generated downstream in planes perpendicular to the freestream direction and their dependence on angles of attack at a chord-based Reynolds number of . It was found that the add-on device significantly reduced the tangential velocity, vorticity, and circulation magnitude by up to 82.9, 92.6, and 42.8%, respectively, and increased the resultant vortex core radius by a factor of 6.57. A six-component force balance was used to obtain the aerodynamic performance of the half-span wing model with a reverse delta-type add-on device. It was found that the reverse delta-type add-on device marginally affected the aerodynamic performance of the half-span high-lift configuration wing model.",54,2
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054078,"The effects of nanosecond pulse driven dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators on turbulent shear layers are examined experimentally on a mixing layer and backward facing step. The nanosecond pulse driven dielectric barrier discharge control mechanism is believed to be primarily thermal in contrast to most flow control actuators, including alternating current dielectric barrier discharges, which rely on periodic or pulsed momentum to excite shear-layer instabilities. Control authority using thermal perturbations has been demonstrated in various high-speed shear flows yet many questions on fundamental physics and scaling remain unanswered. This work aims to provide insight into both nanosecond pulse driven dielectric barrier discharges and thermal mechanisms in general for high-amplitude aerodynamic flow control. Previous studies suggest the efficacy of nanosecond pulse driven dielectric barrier discharges (and likely thermal perturbations in general) is strongly dependent on initial shear-layer conditions, namely some measure of the initial thickness. In an effort to support this hypothesis, boundary-layer suction is applied to a splitter plate upstream of a turbulent mixing-layer origin. This successfully reduces the initial mixing-layer momentum thickness, but does not result in substantial nanosecond pulse driven dielectric barrier discharge control authority. These results and the experimental conditions are documented in detail. Application of nanosecond pulse driven dielectric barrier discharge forcing to the turbulent shear layer downstream of a backward facing step having even smaller initial thickness produces the expected control authority for lower pulse amplitude than employed in the mixing-layer case. This supports the importance of initial shear-layer thickness (rather than state) for estimating potential control authority by nanosecond pulse driven dielectric barrier discharge and thermal perturbations in general.",54,2

The Reynolds number based on the delta wing chord is 50,000. The smoke flow visualization and particle image velocimetry experiments in the wind tunnel indicate that the asymmetric control caused by the dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator can significantly affect the global flow structure over the delta wing: the leading-edge vortex breakdown position on the same side of the actuator is advanced, whereas vortex breakdown on the other side is delayed. This phenomenon is observed for the first time and is only observed in the current full-span delta wing experiment, significantly different from the result of the semispan experiment. The force measurement result shows that the asymmetric control has a limited contribution to lift generation but can induce a relatively large roll moment.",54,2
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054315,"The discharge plasma evolution of a dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator is numerically simulated in the three-dimensional space. The spanwise nonuniformity in the body force field is analyzed, and the validity of the two-dimensional analysis is discussed. A sinusoidal voltage at the electrode is simulated, and the simulation successfully reproduces the characteristics of microdischarge as reported by previous experimental studies. The body force field obtained in the simulation is nonuniform in the spanwise direction, and a strong spanwise force is generated, even from the time-averaged viewpoint. The spanwise-averaged body force field is compared with the two-dimensional simulation result. Although the qualitative characteristics of the body force field in the two-dimensional simulation are the same as in the three-dimensional simulation, the two-dimensional simulation underestimates the chordwise extension of the force field and the force amplitude due to the weaker electric field concentration in the two-dimensional plasma structure. It can be expected that the two-dimensional simulation is useful for preliminary study on the dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator. However, the three-dimensional simulation is indispensable to reproduce the spatial structure of the dielectric barrier discharge plasma, and understanding the interplay between plasma structure and actuator performance is an important aspect of plasma actuator research.",54,2

Exploiting the fact that the cross-sectional dimension is much smaller than the wavelength of the global beam deformation, the three-dimensional hyperelasticity is rigorously reduced to a one-dimensional nonlinear beam analysis and a two-dimensional cross-sectional analysis featuring both geometric and material nonlinearities. The deformation gradient is directly used to enable the capability of dealing with various types of hyperelastic material models defined by the strain energy function. This new theory can predict phenomena from both material and geometric nonlinearities of beam-like structures, such as the trapeze and Poynting effects.

25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054036,"The efficiency of a modal substructuring method depends on the component modes used to reduce each subcomponent model. Methods such as Craig–Bampton have been used extensively to reduce linear finite-element models with thousands or even millions of degrees of freedom down orders of magnitude while maintaining acceptable accuracy. A novel reduction method is proposed here for geometrically nonlinear finite-element models using the fixed-interface and constraint modes of the linearized system to reduce each subcomponent model. The geometric nonlinearity requires an additional cubic and quadratic polynomial function in the modal equations, and the nonlinear stiffness coefficients are determined by applying a series of static loads and using the finite-element code to compute the response. The geometrically nonlinear, reduced modal equations for each subcomponent are then coupled by satisfying compatibility and force equilibrium. This modal substructuring approach is an extension of the Craig–Bampton method and is readily applied to geometrically nonlinear models built directly within commercial finite-element packages. The efficiency of this new approach is demonstrated on two example problems: one that couples two geometrically nonlinear beams at a shared rotational degree of freedom, and another that couples an axial spring element to the axial degree of freedom of a geometrically nonlinear beam. The nonlinear normal modes of the assembled models are compared with those of a truth model to assess the accuracy of the novel modal substructuring approach.",54,2
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054193,"In this study, a novel multiscale combined creep strain and creep rupture model is proposed. By comparing to experimental data, it was shown that the model provides accurate creep rupture predictions for unidirectional off-axis specimens. The creep strain model provides accurate predictions within the confines of the restrictions used in its development. This coupled model was incorporated into a progressive failure finite-element simulation so that the effects of load redistribution could be considered, which tended to increase the life of the part when strain gradients were present. The finite-element implementation also allowed for the consideration of realistic geometries resulting in complex stress states. By considering a perfectly flat specimen and one containing worst-case thickness variation, experimental open-hole creep rupture data was accurately bounded. This suggests that, by quantifying material defects, realistic lifetime predictions can be made, and an estimate of scatter can be acquired.",54,2
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053619,"The dynamic behavior of the flow past a two-dimensional pitching foil is simulated. Based on the Lagrangian coherent structures, it was observed that the leading-edge vortex can trigger a reverse flow from the lower surface, and this reverse flow is the source of the ensuing vortex around the middle of the upper surface. Then, the reverse flow directly drags the fluid flow near the lower surface to form the trailing-edge vortex. During the shedding of the leading-edge vortex at angle of attack of 18.8 deg, the leading-edge vortex is separated into two parts by a new Lagrangian coherent structure. The rear part will leave the foil, and the front part will stay and participate in the generation of the secondary vortex. The trajectories of the particle groups around this Lagrangian coherent structure highlight the evolution of the fluid flow inside the leading-edge vortex during the shedding process. The current study shows that the Lagrangian coherent structure approach together with the Eulerian method can help to have better understandings of the flow physics of a pitching foil during the dynamic stall and the evolution of the secondary vortex.",54,2
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054197,"Immersed boundary methods showed a good compliance for a wide range of complex inviscid and viscous flows. Moreover, the high-Reynolds-number regime still remains an open issue. The paper describes a wall-layer approach to answer the need of a model that goes beyond the actual capability of classical wall functions. A near-wall region is established that gets information from the outer flowfield and returns back the wall stress. The latter is obtained by integrating simplified thin-boundary-layer equations along a normal to the wall subgrid. In the outer zone, the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are solved by means of a finite volume method on two- or three-dimensional Cartesian meshes. The classic validation test dealing with a high-Reynolds-number flow over a flat plate is carried out. A benchmark two-dimensional complex flow is numerically investigated to assess the performance of the wall model in case of a pressure-induced separation.

The method is suitable for applications in flight mechanics, as well as shape optimization, and is demonstrated in this paper for popular flow cases reported in the literature. In particular, adjoint computational fluid dynamics computations were undertaken for airfoils, wings, and rotor-blade cases, and the obtained results were found to agree well with published solutions and with finite differences of flow derivatives. The method has been demonstrated for inviscid and viscous cases, and the results suggest that the current implementation is robust and efficient. The cost of the adjoint computations is relatively low due to the employed source-code differentiation, and most of the time, it is no more than the cost of a steady-state flow solution.",54,2
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054126,"In this paper, we seek to find nonrotating beams that are isospectral to a given tapered rotating beam. Isospectral structures have identical natural frequencies. We assume the mass and stiffness distributions of the tapered rotating beam to be polynomial functions of span. Such polynomial variations of mass and stiffness are typical of helicopter and wind turbine blades. We use the Barcilon–Gottlieb transformation to convert the fourth-order governing equations of the rotating and the nonrotating beams, from the (, ) frame of reference to a hypothetical (, ) frame of reference. If the coefficients of both the equations in the (, ) frame match with each other, then the nonrotating beam is isospectral to the given rotating beam. The conditions on matching the coefficients lead to a pair of coupled differential equations. We solve these coupled differential equations numerically using the fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme. We also verify that the frequencies (given in the literature) of standard tapered rotating beams are the frequencies (obtained using the finite-element analysis) of the isospectral nonrotating beams. Finally, we present an example of beams having a rectangular cross-section to show the application of our analysis. Since experimental determination of rotating beam frequencies is a difficult task, experiments can be easily conducted on these isospectral nonrotating beams to calculate the frequencies of the rotating beam.",54,2
