1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056655,"The vortex dynamics of thrust and lift generation for periodically plunging airfoils and finite wings at low Reynolds numbers is reviewed. Effects of vortex lock-in phenomenon, leading-edge vortex, vortex merging and pairing, vortex–wing interactions, leading-edge geometry, wake deflection, and chordwise and spanwise flexibility on lift and thrust are discussed. Mean lift force of the oscillating airfoil at post-stall angles of attack becomes maximum at optimal frequencies due to the vortex lock-in at the fundamental frequency, subharmonic, and first harmonic of the natural shedding frequency. Bifurcations of wakes of plunging airfoils, which depend on the mean angle of attack and the initial conditions and can produce large mean lift coefficients, are not observed for finite wings. One or two arch-type vortical structures may develop from the leading-edge vortices shed on low-aspect-ratio wings. Significant spanwise flows can develop on finite wings due to the dynamics of tip vortices or leading-edge vortices. Chordwise and spanwise flexibility of plunging airfoils and wings are known to enhance the mean thrust and lift; however, the physical mechanism of the optimal conditions is not well understood. Various flow control opportunities to exploit the flow physics as well as remaining challenges and unresolved issues are summarized.",57,9
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056635,"The propulsive performance of an unsteady heaving and pitching foil is considered, and an extensive experimental parameter space of motion amplitudes, frequencies, and phase offsets between the heave and pitch motions is studied. The phase offset proves to be a critical parameter in determining the foil propulsive performance. To maximize thrust, the pitch motion needs to lag the heave motion by about 30 deg; but, to maximize efficiency, the lag needs to increase to about 90 deg, corresponding to a slicing motion where the angle of attack is minimized. Scaling relations are also presented, and they are developed from lift-based and added mass forces, which describe the experimental data closely. Using the scaling relations as a guide, increases in performance are found when foil amplitudes (specifically pitch) increase while maintaining a modest angle of attack.",57,9
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056637,"Recently, it was demonstrated in an inviscid flow that burst-and-coast or intermittent swimming can save energy when compared with continuous swimming and that the energy savings are maximized for large-amplitude pitching motions where flow separation is likely to occur. This paper examines the effects of flow separation on altering inviscid flow predictions. As such, viscous and inviscid flow simulations are presented of a hydrofoil pitching intermittently with large-amplitude motions. It is observed that leading-edge vortex formation and shedding in a viscous flow significantly alter the wake dynamics from the inviscid flow solutions where only trailing-edge shedding is modeled. Moreover, the inviscid flow solutions predict higher peak force production, lower cost of transport, and lower optimal duty cycles than the viscous flow solutions. Despite these differences, the trends in the force production and energetics seen in a viscous flow are well captured by the inviscid flow simulations. Importantly, both predict energy savings on the order of 10–30% for intermittent swimming, and the energy savings increase when the amplitude of motion is increased even when significant leading-edge separation occurs.",57,9
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056634,"Inviscid computational results are presented on a self-propelled virtual body combined with an airfoil undergoing pitch oscillations about its leading edge. The scaling trends of the time-averaged thrust forces are shown to be predicted accurately by Garrick’s theory. However, the scaling of the time-averaged power for finite-amplitude motions is shown to deviate from the theory. Novel time-averaged power scalings are presented that account for a contribution from added-mass forces, from the large-amplitude separating shear layer at the trailing edge, and from the proximity of the trailing-edge vortex. Scaling laws for the self-propelled speed, efficiency, and cost of transport (CoT) are subsequently derived. Using these scaling relations, the self-propelled metrics can be predicted to within 5% of their full-scale values by using parameters known a priori. The relations may be used to drastically speed up the design phase of bioinspired propulsion systems by offering a direct link between design parameters and the expected CoT. The scaling relations also offer one of the first mechanistic rationales for the scaling of the energetics of self-propelled swimming. Specifically, the cost of transport is shown to scale predominately with the added mass power. This suggests that the CoT of organisms or vehicles using unsteady propulsion will scale with their mass as , which is indeed shown to be consistent with existing biological data.",57,9
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056621,"A majority of fish and other aquatic animals generate thrust by oscillating their fins and flukes, which creates a highly three-dimensional and complex wake that is characterized by spanwise compression, transverse expansion, wake breakdown, etc. The interaction between the oscillating fins and the surrounding fluid creates a complex system of wake structures that is a signature of what can be an animal’s markedly efficient swimming abilities. To interrogate the evolution of these flowfields, Lagrangian analysis using the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field was carried out on experimentally recorded three-dimensional velocity data in the wake of an oscillating trapezoidal panel that models a fish caudal fin in a Strouhal number range of 0.17–0.56. The release of bounding Lagrangian saddles, identified as intersections of positive- and negative-time finite-time Lyapunov exponent ridges, from the panel trailing edge is shown to be related to the extrema of thrust and the evolution of the streamwise momentum field during an oscillation period. The location of vortex disintegration, which is observed downstream of the panel–fluid interaction, was observed to correspond with regions of low streamwise momentum, bifurcated wake structure, and the merger of Lagrangian saddles from two consecutive spanwise structures.",57,9
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057203,"An adjoint-based optimization is applied to study the thrust performance of a pitching–rolling ellipsoidal plate in a uniform stream at Reynolds number 100. To achieve the highest thrust, the optimal kinematics of pitching–rolling motion is sought in a control space including the pitching amplitude, the rolling amplitude, and the phase delay between the pitching and rolling motions. A continuous adjoint approach with boundary motion being handled by noncylindrical calculus is developed as a computationally efficient optimization algorithm to deal with large control space with a morphing domain. The comparison between the optimal motion and other reference motions shows a significant improvement of thrust from the increase of the rolling amplitude and an optimal phase delay of 122.6 deg between the pitching and rolling motions. The combination of these two factors impacts the overall thrust performance through their strong effects on the angle of attack, the leading-edge vortex circulation, and the pressure distribution on the plate. Further wake structure analysis suggests that the optimal motion improves its propulsive performance by generating a stronger leading-edge vortex and straightening the wake deflection.",57,9
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056584,"At low Reynolds numbers, revolving wings become less efficient in generating lift for hovering flight due to the increasing adverse viscous effects. Flying insects use reciprocating revolving wings that exploit unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms for lift augmentation. Here, the aerodynamics of an alternative that introduces unsteadiness to the revolving wings through vertical flapping and its potential to improve aerodynamic performance are investigated. The force production and the flow pattern of such flapping-perturbed revolving wing are analyzed via combined experimental and computational investigations. The results show that drag reduction can be produced consistently by a flapping-perturbed revolving wing at zero angle of attack. The reduction is linearly dependent on Strouhal number, and the critical Strouhal number at equilibrium rotating state is similar to that of two-dimensional heaving plates. At positive angles of attack, the flapping perturbation leads to substantial lift augmentation, accompanied by relatively small increase of drag or even minor drag reduction, depending on the Strouhal number and flapping amplitude. Though slightly less efficient at these angles of attack in terms of power loading, flapping perturbations can be used to improve the maximum lift coefficients attainable by revolving wings and thus have potential applications in micro air vehicle designs.",57,9
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056622,"Insect wings are flexible structures that passively deform under the action of inertial and aerodynamic forces in flight. Previous studies have focused on the aerodynamic and energetic merits of these deformations. Here, the effect of torsional wing flexibility on maneuverability is investigated by modeling the dynamics of the wing pitch motion when body yaw rotation is imposed. Analyses were carried out for different nondimensional stiffness levels, characterized by Cauchy number and body-to-wing velocity ratios . In addition, the impacts of inertial effects were evaluated via changing mass ratio. It was demonstrated that body rotations change the balance between the aerodynamic and elastic torque exerted about the wings’ pitching axes. This results in passive variations in the wing pitch angles that are bilaterally asymmetric and increase linearly with the ratio of the body rotational velocity to the wing flapping velocity . The passive changes in the bilateral pitch angles induce a torque about the body’s yaw rotation, which curtails rotational damping effects due to the flapping motion of the wings, known as flapping counter-torque. The results reveal that torsionally flexible wing designs could enhance maneuverability by mitigating the need for active wing kinematic modulations during aerial maneuvers.",57,9
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056583,"The stability of flapping flight, which is a natural requirement for flying insects, is one of the major challenges for micro aerial vehicles. A fully coupled computational model is employed that combines the Navier–Stokes equations and the equations of motion in six degrees of freedom to model the hovering flight of a hawk moth. These simulations are combined with high-speed videogrammetry experiments on live, untethered hawk moths flying in quiescent and perturbed flows. The flight videos are used to identify a potential mechanism that could be used by the moth to stabilize its hovering flight. The effectiveness of this mechanism is then investigated using computational-fluid-dynamics-based simulations and semianalytic approximations. The results of the current study should improve the understanding of mechanisms used by flying insects to stabilize themselves and help to gain insights that can be employed for micro aerial vehicles.",57,9
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058504,"Simulations were carried out of a 24° compression ramp in Mach 2.25, turbulent flow. In addition to simulations of the baseline flow, calculations were carried out with flow control applied, in the form of a streamwise body force with a wall-normal profile chosen to match a perturbation velocity profile previously identified through conditional averaging. Forcing in the upstream boundary layer with this particular form was found to drive large-scale separation unsteadiness downstream. Power spectral densities of the wall pressure fluctuations in the separated region displayed a low-frequency component that increased in proportion to the amplitude of forcing. The separation location and separation shock location were both observed to be synchronized with the forcing. These results are consistent with the Plotkin model of separation unsteadiness, and present an example of a case where large-scale separation motion is sensitive to external disturbances.",57,9
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058448,"Experiments were carried out on a rectangular cavity to study the effects of interaction between a transient shock system and a cavity shear layer on cavity oscillations through high-speed images and unsteady pressure measurements. The interaction studies under transient conditions were carried out for the range of pressure varying from to 0.63. The high-speed shadowgraph images revealed that the interaction was found to be predominant at and 0.56, where the cavity pressure spectra possessed numerous modes/tones. At and 0.46, the high-speed images showed virtually no interaction between transient shock and the cavity shear layer. At and 0.63, the interaction was found to be minimal where limited modes/tones were experienced by the cavity. Under the fully established supersonic condition , dominant modes/tones were seen at discrete frequencies. Irrespective of the pressures , the pressure spectra inside the cavity at different locations indicated the global instability. Conversely, by increasing the pressures beyond , a mode switching phenomena was observed as a consequence of transient shock interaction with the cavity shear layer. The overall sound pressure levels for these cases were found to be varied from 154 to 175 dB. The present studies indicated that the effect of transient shock interaction with the cavity shear layer needs to be accounted for in the design phase.",57,9
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058335,"The effects of the phase difference between fore- and hindwings are experimentally investigated on the aerodynamic force, aerodynamic efficiency, and longitudinal control forces for tandem flapping wings in hovering and forward flight. The aerodynamic force and power are measured using a dynamically scaled mechanical model in a water tunnel at a Reynolds number of 7660–11,400. The experimental results indicate that a tandem configuration, except in-phase motion, is detrimental to the generation of vertical and horizontal aerodynamic forces in hovering and slow forward flight; whereas the vertical force is enhanced in out-of-phase motion when the hindwing leads the forewing in faster forward flight. In-phase motion has the largest aerodynamic efficiency of all the phase differences in hovering and forward flight, which does not correspond to the phase difference that dragonflies use in hovering and forward flight. In contrast, a shift in the phase difference in the range of 45–180 deg (hindwing leads forewing) does not change the total vertical or horizontal force but largely and monotonically changes the pitching moment about the body caused by the force difference between the fore- and hindwings in hovering and forward flight, which corresponds to the fact that dragonflies use antiphase motion in hovering and out-of-phase motion of 50–130 deg in forward flight.",57,9
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057270,"A new type of pivoting-blade cycloidal propeller, which can equip aircraft with vertical take-off and landing capability, is presented in this paper. This propeller has the appearance of damselfly wings and the advantage of low mass compared with other types developed to date. The operating mode shows similarities with the movement of these insects’ wings to generate upward vertical thrust. To cover the range of Reynolds number from 2250 to 25,000, propellers with 70 and 200 mm blades were constructed. Using the blade element theory, a simplified two-dimensional mathematical model was developed to predict thrust, power, and hovering efficiency. Experiments were performed to validate that model for the case of hovering flight. Quantitatively, the results of the experiments match the prediction produced by the two-dimensional mathematical model very well. The theoretical analysis proves that both lift and drag contribute to the net vertical force, and the contribution of drag is at least 50%. This way of generating vectored thrust is emerging as an alternative solution to other types of propulsion in low-Reynolds-number regimes with a blade tip Mach number not greater than 0.2.",57,9
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058277,"Membrane wings exhibit several aerodynamic advantages at low Reynolds numbers, passively adapting to flow conditions and delaying stall to significantly higher angles of attack relative to rigid wings. Rigid wings, on the other hand, often rely on active flow control mechanisms to achieve high angles of attack, injecting momentum to induce vortex roll-up in the shear layer. Active flow control for membrane wings is limited by the flexible nature of the wing surface. However, it is possible to achieve active flow control with a membrane wing by using a dielectric elastomer actuator as the membrane material. In this work, the performance of a sinusoidally actuated membrane wing is characterized for a range of actuation frequencies, freestream velocities, and angles of attack. Lift measurements show lift enhancement of up to 20%. Time-resolved membrane kinematics are used to calculate the coefficient of added momentum of the actuator, and the effect on the flow field is shown using phase-averaged particle image velocimetry measurements. Dynamic mode decomposition is used to show vortical structures being shed from the leading edge in phase with actuation, and comparisons are made with synthetic jet literature to show the similarities to separated flow control techniques used on rigid wings.",57,9
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058288,"The paper investigates the performance of a recently developed laminar separation transition triggering approach (criteria-based) that controls the transitional turbulence source terms. Computational results are compared with available experimental and large-eddy simulation data for low-Reynolds-number quasi-incompressible flow over the SD7003 airfoil. The influence of the angle of attack, the chord-based Reynolds number, and the turbulence intensity at transition onset is satisfactory, provided that the correct transition location is returned by the correlations. The results highlight the importance of correctly modeling the rapid growth of turbulence kinetic energy immediately downstream of transition onset.",57,9
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058026,"The effectiveness in estimating the velocity field in a laminar separation bubble using surface-pressure-based stochastic estimation methods is examined. A separation bubble is formed over a NACA 0018 airfoil at a Reynolds number of 125,000 and an angle of attack of 4°, while the velocity field and surface pressure fluctuations are measured simultaneously. Single-time-delay and multi-time-delay estimation techniques, in both single-point and multipoint formulations, are employed and compared, showing that the accuracy of the estimates increases notably through the inclusions of additional predictor events in both space and time. The multipoint, multi-time-delay estimation technique is shown to produce the most accurate estimates, with the reconstructed velocity fields capturing all essential flow features across the scales of interest. The accuracy of the estimates is shown to depend on location within the bubble, with the best results found in the region of the mean maximum bubble height, whereas performance decreases near the mean separation point. The latter is due to the transition to turbulence increasing the randomness of fluctuations and can be mitigated through more advanced stochastic estimation, whereas the former is a result of low disturbance amplitudes that fall within the noise level of the measurements.",57,9
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057871,"Experimental studies of the changes in turbulence characteristics inside a boundary layer due to external forcing were performed using hot-wire anemometry. The forcing was created by a periodically forced shear layer that was external to a compressible subsonic turbulent boundary layer. The convecting coherent structures in the shear layer create a concomitant unsteady pressure and velocity field and provide an external disturbance for the turbulent boundary layer on the wall of the tunnel close to the forced shear layer. Both the pressure and velocity fluctuations inside the boundary layer were simultaneously measured along with the forcing signal, and a phase-locked analysis was performed. Regions of amplified turbulence inside the boundary layer were observed. Near the wall, the region of amplified turbulence was slightly upstream or lagging of the external forcing and away from the wall it was downstream or leading the forcing signal. Analysis of the convective speeds in the region of amplified turbulence supported the existence of the critical layer inside the wake region of the boundary layer, and the critical layer is believed to be responsible for the amplified levels of the turbulence in the wake region. Various modulation and amplification correlation coefficients were computed and analyzed, and the results also indicated the presence of the critical layer. Examination of the phase-locked turbulence revealed similarities between the turbulence amplitude amplification results due to these externally forced experiments and modulation response of an internally forced, subsonic boundary layer in the literature.",57,9

Experiments performed in the 0.3 m transonic cryogenic tunnel allowed for testing at 300 K in gaseous nitrogen over a range of pressures (124–517 kPa) and Mach numbers (0.2–0.8) for freestream conditions and flow behind a cylindrical model. Measurement precision and accuracy are determined for the current set of experiments, as are signal intensity and lifetime. Precisions of 3– (based on one standard deviation) were typical in the experiment; precisions better than 2% of the mean velocity were obtained for some of the highest-velocity conditions. Agreement within a mean error of between STARFLEET freestream velocity measurements and facility data acquisition system readings is demonstrated. STARFLEET is also shown to return spatially resolved velocity profiles, although some binning of the signal is required to achieve the reported measurement precision.",57,9

Freestream Mach numbers are within the range , and freestream unit Reynolds numbers vary within the range . The model is a 7 deg half-angle cone, which is 800 mm long, with exchangeable nose tips for which the radii vary between 0.05 and 10 mm. The natural transition process is investigated using flush-mounted thermocouples, fast-response pressure sensors, and a laser-based schlieren flow visualization technique. The most amplified frequencies retrieved experimentally from wavelet analysis techniques compare excellently with linear stability theory results and confirm the inviscid nature of the instabilities observed along geometries with a small amount of nose-tip bluntness. The corresponding factors at the transition onset are inferred from the experimental location where transition is initiated. Schlieren images exhibit the typical rope shape of second-mode instabilities for the sharpest nose tips, but not along blunter geometries where instabilities peak outward of the boundary-layer edge. The different measurement techniques used show that the maximum amplitude of the second-mode waves is reached shortly after the location with the minimum wall heat flux. Schlieren images show that wave packets break down to turbulence near the middle of the transition region.",57,9
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057975,"Direct numerical simulation of Görtler vortices in hypersonic compression ramp flow is performed. Three ramp angles of 15, 20, and 25 deg are considered for a freestream Mach number of 7.7 and a unit Reynolds number of . The results show that a mesh resolution of 151 million points is sufficient to capture the flow details. The validation tests present excellent agreement with theoretical values and experimental data. Görtler vortices show unsteady features for the considered ramp flows. The induced heat flux variation and the vortex structure of Görtler vortices are discussed. Two methods of determining the Görtler number are proposed. The first one gives the variation of the Görtler number near reattachment based on the computational results. Additionally, based on a simplified model, a formula depending only on the flow condition and the geometry of the ramp model is deduced to predict the Görtler number. It is shown that the latter method can quantitatively predict the Görtler number near reattachment, and the predictions are in qualitative agreement with a theoretical stability analysis. In the flowfield, corrugated reattachment resulting from the three-dimensionality of the separation bubble is found. Görtler vortices originating in the shear layer as a result of streamline curvature are enhanced at and after flow reattachment.",57,9
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057869,"In a hypersonic environment, the high kinetic energy of the oncoming flow causes the molecules in the flow to be thermally excited, leading to dissociation. In such a flow field, an aero-optical analysis that considers thermochemical nonequilibrium may be necessary to assist in sensor design. The present study assesses the optical properties of a nonequilibrium, real gas flow field around a hemisphere cylinder. The simulations are conducted at freestream Mach numbers of 11, 13, and 15. The optical distortions are quantified using optical path length and optical path difference. Optical distortion is also predicted using a perfect gas assumption, and these distortions are provided for comparison. The primary contributions of nonequilibrium parameters on optical distortion are identified. For all Mach numbers, optical path lengths are higher when the effects of dissociation and vibrational relaxation are included. The computational results show that oxygen dissociation is the dominant nonequilibrium flow phenomena affecting the optical distortion. However, as the freestream Mach number increases, atomic nitrogen begins to have an additional influence on optical aberrations.",57,9
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058204,"Cavity-enhanced combustion in an optical axisymmetric scramjet with a diverging combustor is experimentally investigated in Mach 4.5 flows. The axisymmetric scramjet emphasizes generic combustion and flameholding dynamics without the corner boundary-layer effects that can distort flame propagation in rectangular geometries. Combustion dynamics is characterized by pressure distributions along the combustor wall as well as heat flux measurements at the combustor exit. Flame structures are resolved by instantaneous hydroxyl planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging. The cavity flameholder enhances combustion stability through improved fuel–air mixing and promotes the growth of the flame length scales in the diverging combustor. Direct heat addition into the core flow through mixing dominates the combustor performance and can lead to thermal choking. The combustor area relief needs to balance the combustion heat loading for optimal combustor performance such that sufficient and stable energy release can occur in the combustor. Excessive area relief or fast flow expansion can quench the reacting flow, leading to deterioration in performance.",57,9
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058197,"The interaction of shock waves with supersonic film-cooling flows is investigated experimentally by high-speed particle-image velocimetry. A laminar jet is tangentially injected into a turbulent boundary layer at a freestream Mach number . The injection Mach numbers are and . The total temperature and static pressure of the injection match the freestream condition. A deflection of and generates a shock that impinges upon the film-cooling flow at two positions downstream of the injection slot. The flow structure of the shock/cooling-film interaction is highly sensitive to the injection Mach number. An increased injection Mach number (i.e., higher near-wall momentum) stabilizes the flow and drastically decreases the separation-bubble size. Because of the additional free shear layer and the near-wall jet, the large-scale low-frequency motion of the separation shock is reduced by one order of magnitude compared to the oscillation in standard shock/boundary-layer interaction.",57,9
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058049,"The convective structure and heat transfer characteristics of evaporating films under conditions of cyclical superheating were examined experimentally. An isolated closed test cell allowed the films to evaporate into their own vapor without noncondensable gases present. The level of superheat was controlled by modulating the system pressure. A double-pass schlieren system was employed to capture convective structures, and a nonintrusive, ultrasonic thickness measurement technique was used to yield dynamic heat flux measurements at the film surface. The evolution of the superheat level has a strong impact on the development of convective structures and heat transfer. In some cases, convective structures appear within the film under pressure-modulated conditions even when the evaporation intervals are sufficiently short that conduction is the dominant heat transfer mode. Convective structures persist in many cases after evaporation is stopped. Stopping the evaporation for short time intervals has a negligible effect on the convective structure. Complex, multiwavelength convective structure behavior can be induced through cyclical superheating of the films.",57,9

The objective was to gain insights into spatial modes of base pressure fluctuations by identifying their shape and nature, and the mechanism of their origin using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition. It is observed that 90–95% of the cumulative energy content resides within the first three modes at all Strouhal numbers for all freestream Mach numbers. Further, at subsonic Mach numbers and for Strouhal numbers , the shape of the modes indicates that their nature is symmetric, and the mechanism for the origin of the dominant mode is the pulsing action of the recirculation bubble. However, for Strouhal numbers , the shape of the modes is asymmetric, indicating that their nature is antisymmetric, and the mechanism associated with the dominant mode is the radial displacement of the recirculation bubble coupled with the motion of structures within the recirculation bubble. At supersonic Mach numbers and for all Strouhal numbers, the shape of the modes indicates that they are symmetric, and the dominant mechanism is the pulsing action of the recirculation bubble.",57,9

The jet is characterized by a nozzle pressure ratio of 3.4 and a fully expanded Mach number of 1.45. At this condition, the dominant instability mode of the jet is the helical (C) mode. The numerical results of mean velocity fields, shock structures, and the screech frequency are in good agreement with the experimental results. A single helical vortex appears in the jet shear layer, which coincides with the helical mode. At the fourth shock cell, the dominant acoustic source location for the screech tone, the shock interacts with vortices and oscillates periodically. The flow structures associated with the generations of the screech tone and the second harmonic are analyzed by the proper orthogonal decomposition. The coherent structures with the azimuthal wave number and 2 are related to the screech tone and its second harmonic, respectively.",57,9
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057295,"This paper presents a numerical investigation of flow control with blowing and suction in the whole structure consisting of an aggressive S-shaped air intake accompanied by a downstream fan stage. The results show that the effect of blowing–suction flow control is neither the simple summation of the effects of a single blowing control and a suction control nor the simple differences between them. It is the best one among three flow control techniques studied in this paper. The approach to selecting the optimum flow control scheme via simulating the single air intake, and afterward performing the numerical simulation of whole passage, has a certain rationality. With the blowing–suction flow control, the maximum isentropic efficiency and maximum total pressure ratio of the fan stage increase by 2.70 and 3.13%, respectively. Moreover, the rotor of the fan stage has a significant effect in reducing circumferential distortions. Due to the influence of the rotating fan rotor, the low-energy region at the lower side of the cross sections decreases gradually when approaching the fan-stage inlet. The low-energy fluid always exists in several blade passages after it enters the fan stage. Using the blowing–suction flow control, the relative total pressure of fluid in these low-energy passages increases to an extent. Streamlines in the fan stator flow passages and on stator blades show that the blowing–suction flow control in the air intake can improve the fan stator flow pattern, reducing the flow separation in general.",57,9

Its goal is to demonstrate the viability and potential of heavier-than-air vehicles in the Martian atmosphere. The low density of the Martian atmosphere and the relatively small-scale rotor result in flows with very low Reynolds number, reducing the lifting force and lifting efficiency, respectively. This paper describes the generation of the improved Mars Helicopter aerodynamic rotor model. The goal is to generate a performance model for the Mars Helicopter rotor using a free wake analysis in CAMRADII. The improvements in the analysis are twofold and are expanded on from two prior publications. First, the fidelity of the simulations is increased by performing higher-order time-accurate OVERFLOW simulations allowing for higher-accuracy aerodynamic coefficients and a better understanding of the boundary-layer behavior. Second, a model is generated for the testing conditions in the 25-ft-diam Space Simulator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, allowing for better correlation of rotor performance figures. The higher temperatures in the experiment are expected to give conservative performance estimates, as they give rise to an increase in speed of sound and decrease in observed Reynolds numbers.",57,9

The upsweep angle considered is , the Reynolds number based on the body’s diameter is , and the freestream Mach number is . These conditions have been selected following recent experimental measurements that serve as validation for the numerical study. The results here also complement the experimental investigation by expanding upon the unsteady aspects of the flow and uncovering details of the full three-dimensional flow structure both on and off the body, which are otherwise unattainable through planar particle image velocimetry and point measurements alone. Details of the wake vortices’ unsteady formation, their interaction on the aft surface, and subsequent mutual interaction are explored. The comparative study of the numerical results and the experimental measurements provides an extremely favorable match between the time-mean vortex size, strength, and position in the wake, along with its surface pressure signature on the body’s aft ramp. Spatial resolution effects are also extensively investigated and effectively eliminated for all quantities of interest. This, in conjunction with the experimental validation, provides strong confidence in the numerical results for future and expanded studies.",57,9
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057259,"It has been long known that 2D and 3D inviscid adjoint solutions are generically singular at sharp trailing edges. In this paper, a concurrent effect is described by which wall boundary values of 2D and 3D inviscid continuous and discrete adjoint solutions based on lift and drag are strongly mesh dependent and do not converge as the mesh is refined. Various numerical tests are performed to characterize the problem. Lift-based adjoint solutions are found to be affected for any flow condition, whereas drag-based adjoint solutions are affected for transonic lifting flows. A (laminar) viscous case is examined as well, but no comparable behavior is found, which suggests that the issue is exclusive to inviscid flows. It is argued that this behavior is caused by the trailing edge adjoint singularity.",57,9

32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057880,This paper presents a novel multiscale framework based on higher-order one-dimensional finite element models. The refined finite element models originate from the Carrera unified formulation (CUF): a novel and efficient methodology to develop higher-order structural theories hierarchically via a variable kinematic approach. The concurrent multiscale framework consists of a macroscale model to describe the structural level components interfaced with efficient CUF micromechanical models. Such micromechanical models can take into account the detailed architecture of the microstructure with high fidelity. The framework derives its efficiency from the capability of CUF models to detect accurate three-dimensional-like stress fields at reduced computational costs. This paper also shows the ability of the framework to interface with different classes of representative volume elements and the benefits of parallel implementations. The numerical cases focus on composite and sandwich structures and demonstrate the high fidelity and feasibility of the proposed framework. The efficiency of the framework stems from comparisons with the analysis time and memory requirement against traditional multiscale implementations.,57,9
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057881,"This paper presents a computationally efficient concurrent multiscale platform to undertake the nonlinear analysis of composite structures. The framework exploits refined one-dimensional models developed within the scheme of the Carrera unified formulation (CUF), which is a generalized hierarchical formulation that generates refined structural theories via a variable kinematic description. The CUF operates at the macro- and microscales, and the macroscale interfaces with a nonlinear micromechanical toolbox. The computational efficiency derives from the ability of the CUF to obtain accurate three-dimensional (3-D)-like stress fields with a reduced computational cost. The nonlinearity is at the matrix level within the microscale, and its effect scales up to the macroscale through homogenization. The macrotangent matrix adopts a perturbation-based method to have meliorated performances. The numerical results demonstrate that the framework requires some 50% of the computational time and 10% of memory usage of traditional 3-D finite elements. Very detailed local effects at the microscale are detectable, and there are no restrictions concerning the complexity of the geometry.",57,9
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058220,"Accurate modeling of composite structures is important for their safe application under different loading conditions. To provide accurate predictions of three-dimensional (3D) stress fields in an efficient computational framework, in this study, a modeling approach that builds upon the recently developed hierarchical Serendipity Lagrange finite elements (FEs) is employed. The approach provides layerwise (LW) and equivalent single-layer (ESL) models for analyzing constant- and variable-stiffness laminated beam structures. To enhance the capability of the ESL model, two zig-zag (ZZ) functions, namely, Murakami’s ZZ function (MZZF) and the refined ZZ theory function (RZT), are implemented. For constant-stiffness laminated and sandwich beams, the RZT ZZ function predicts the structural response more accurately than the MZZF. However, for variable-stiffness laminated structures, the applicability of RZT remains unknown and its accuracy is therefore tested within the present formulation. Results obtained are validated against 3D closed-form and 3D FE solutions available from the literature. For similar levels of accuracy, significant gains in computational efficiency are achieved over 3D FE and LW models by using the ESL approach with RZT ZZ functions.",57,9
35,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057756,"A high-fidelity multidisciplinary modeling and optimization capability is employed for optimization of structural properties of the 13 m Scaled Wind Farm Technology Facility wind-turbine blade of Sandia National Laboratories. This involves coupling a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes fluid dynamics solver with a structural finite element solver. The exact sensitivities of performance objectives are obtained using the discrete adjoint method. For each of several load cases, the composite fiber angles throughout the internal structure of the blade are optimized to minimize a scalar stress parameter that correlates with the accumulation of fatigue damage. Three main types of loads regularly experienced by a wind-turbine blade are identified: aerodynamic loads, centrifugal loads, and gravitational loads. Static structural optimization is performed with the blade under centrifugal and aerodynamic loads, and dynamic optimization with the blade under gravitational loads. Then, static and dynamic optimizations are performed again with all combined loads present. A 18–60% reduction in the driving stress for fatigue is seen in after optimization.",57,9
36,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058240,"In the present research, thermally induced vibration of shallow spherical shells made of functionally graded materials is investigated. The thermomechanical properties of the FGM media are assumed to be temperature dependent. Based on the uncoupled thermoelasticity theory, the one-dimensional heat conduction equation is established. The top and bottom surfaces of the shell are subjected to several types of rapid heating boundary condition. Because of the temperature dependency of the material properties, solution of nonlinear heat conduction equation needs a numerical method. In the first step, generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM) is applied to discretize the heat conduction equation across the shell thickness. Afterward, the governing system of time-dependent ordinary differential equations is solved using the successive Crank–Nicolson scheme. The obtained thermal force and thermal moment resultants at each time step are applied to the equations of motion. The axisymmetric equations of motion, using the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) based on the Kármán type of geometrical nonlinearity, are derived with the aid of the Hamilton principle. Using the harmonic differential quadrature method, shell domain is divided into a number of nodal points, and differential equations are turned into a system of ordinary differential equations. To obtain the displacement components at any time, time marching scheme based on the Newmark method is implemented. The obtained highly nonlinear algebraic equations are solved by means of the Newton–Raphson method. Comparison studies are performed to validate the formulation and solution method of the present research. Various examples are illustrated to discuss the influences of effective parameters such as power law index in the FGM formulation, thickness of the shell, temperature dependency, shell opening angle, in-plane boundary conditions, type of thermal boundary conditions, and geometrical nonlinearity on thermally induced response of the FGM shell under thermal shock.",57,9
37,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058182,"Because of dry friction in the contact surface of bolted, riveted, and clamped band joints, they are potentially suitable for mitigating vibration in structures. This capability is activated if excitation vector has a component on the contact surface, and this depends on the joint geometry. A fundamental study on the shock response spectrum (SRS) of a single-degree-of-freedom model of joint containing Jenkins element as a bilinear hysteresis for dry friction modeling is considered here. The equation of motion is analytically solved for extracting the SRS to rectangular base acceleration pulse. The effect of various physical parameters, influenced by joint geometry and fastener pretension, on the acceleration transmissibility is investigated. The highest level of SRS is studied when physical parameters vary and optimum values of these parameters are determined for minimizing the SRS. The consequence of this fundamental study can be useful for designing joints as a dissipation mechanism in structures. In the solution process before extracting the SRS, some phenomenological studies are carried out on stick/slip phenomenon in the joint.",57,9
38,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058372,"In this paper, the potential static strength of hybrid (bolted/bonded)—termed “HBB”—joints with functionally graded adhesives (FGA) is theoretically investigated, in reference to the pure bolted joint, the pure bonded joint, and the HBB joint with homogeneous adhesive (HA). The investigation is performed on a particular in-plane tensile-loaded single-lap joint made of identical aluminum adherends with two lines of fasteners and three various adhesive symmetrical graduation laws. The stress analysis is performed using the macro-element technique within 1D-bar framework. Moreover, closed-form expressions for the bolt load transfer rates and maximal adhesive stresses of balanced single-lap HBB joint with two identical fasteners are derived. It is shown that the FGAs allow fort a better load sharing between the adhesive and the fasteners than the HA. Moreover, the use of FGAs instead of HA could lead to a potential static strength benefit for the adhesive layer part rather than for the fastening part.",57,9
