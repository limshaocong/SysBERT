0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056716,"This paper presents a study of the leading-edge noise radiated by an airfoil undergoing a turbulent inflow. The noise prediction of generic airfoil profiles subjected to spanwise-varying inflow conditions is performed with the support of Amiet’s theory and the inverse strip technique. In the proposed methodology, the aeroacoustic transfer function of a generic airfoil profile is computed by the boundary element method. The effects of the airfoil leading-edge thickness on the inflow turbulence are accounted for by a turbulence spectrum based on the rapid distortion theory. This research shows that the turbulence distortion plays a significant role on the predicted noise levels. Compared with the von Kármán model for isotropic turbulence, the rapid distortion theory predicts reduced noise levels at high frequencies and increased noise levels at low frequencies. This paper also shows that the spanwise-varying inflow, here represented by a linearly changing condition, contributes to raising the noise levels when compared to the similar uniform inflow case. This research confirms that the finite airfoil thickness decreases the airfoil-gust lift response, consequently reducing the noise levels. This observation is more pronounced for microphones positioned downstream of the airfoil and for high frequencies.",56,5

The dynamics and structure of rotating detonations are an area of active interest owing to their sensitivity to a wide range of factors, which have been hard to predict. In the current manuscript, we argue that rotating detonations share a considerable number of quantitative and qualitative properties with spinning detonations, which is a well-known near-limit phenomenon in fundamental detonation studies. We show that the fill height in rotating detonations play the same role as the pitch length inscribed by spinning detonations. While the pitch-to-hydraulic diameter ratio of spinning detonations is known to range from 2 to 6 across a wide range of conditions, it is shown here, from literature, that the fill height-to-hydraulic diameter of rotating detonations also extends across a similar range—between 1 and 5 across diverse facilities and conditions.",56,5

To reduce the material cost of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer shells, hybrid fiber composite shells composed of carbon fibers, glass fibers, and an epoxy matrix would be a more promising choice. Along with the development of heavy lift launch vehicles, the diameter of a required shell structure could become large. The buckling analysis of composite shells based on detailed finite element models was too time consuming. From the point of view of model size reduction, accurate reduced-order models for buckling analysis along with optimization methods were needed to improve the efficiency of the design and analysis cycle of composite shells. A combined proper orthogonal decomposition and optimization method is proposed in this paper for an efficient buckling analysis of composite shells. In the offline steps of proper orthogonal decomposition, one single finite-element-model buckling analysis is performed based on a full-order model of the initial design with the certain volume fractions of hybrid fibers. Furthermore, snapshots generated from the eigenvector values of the finite-element-model buckling analysis result from the initial design, and a proper orthogonal decomposition basis is determined. By using the obtained proper orthogonal decomposition basis from the initial design, the online steps of proper orthogonal decomposition can be carried out for the buckling analysis of any composite shell with varying volume fractions of hybrid fibers. To further improve the prediction accuracy for a large design space, the mixed proper orthogonal decomposition snapshot method is proposed by adding additional proper orthogonal decomposition snapshots into the original ones. The proposed method contributes to improving the prediction accuracy among the entire design space significantly. Finally, a low-cost optimization framework is established for hybrid fiber composite shells, during which the proper orthogonal decomposition method is used for accelerating the buckling analysis. In particular, a convergence criterion and an updated proper orthogonal decomposition basis strategy are proposed for the optimization framework, aiming at guaranteeing the credibility of the optimal proper orthogonal decomposition buckling result. By means of an illustrative example, the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed framework are demonstrated.",56,5

Flow physics of these approaches involve flow separation from the edge, roll-up into the vortex, wing flow regime, vortex instabilities, vortex–vortex interactions, and vortex–turbulence interactions. Actuators include continuous and unsteady blowing as well as suction, bleed, and control surfaces, which add momentum, vorticity, and turbulence into the vortices. It is noted that actuation may have effects on more than one aspect of the flow phenomena. A comparative review of the control of delta-wing vortices, tip vortices, and afterbody vortices is presented. The delay of vortex breakdown and the promotion of flow reattachment require different considerations for slender and nonslender delta wings and may not be possible at all. Tip vortices can be controlled to increase the effective span, to generate rolling moment, to attenuate wing rock, and to attenuate vortex–wing interactions. Although there are different approaches for each application, opportunities for future research on turbulence ingestion, bleed, and excitation of vortex instabilities exist. Recent research also indicates that active and passive flow control can be used to manipulate the afterbody vortices to reduce the drag.",56,5

The analysis is based on direct numerical simulations. The studied scenario includes the impulse response of the system to a generic disturbance in the freestream, which triggers a Tollmien–Schlichting wave packet inside the boundary layer. The performance of a linear quadratic Gaussian controller is analyzed to suppress the amplitude of the Tollmien–Schlichting wave packet using a row of sensors and plasma actuators localized at the wall. The target of the controller is chosen as a subset of proper orthogonal decomposition modes describing the dynamics of the unstable disturbances. The plasma actuators are implemented as volume forcing. To account for the limitations of the plasma actuators concerning a unidirectional forcing, several strategies are implemented in the linear quadratic Gaussian framework. Their performances are compared with that for classical linear quadratic Gaussian controller. These controllers successfully reduced the amplitude of the wave packet.",56,5

Artificial Tollmien–Schlichting waves are generated at a frequency of in a two-dimensional zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate boundary layer . The Tollmien–Schlichting waves travel downstream and are attenuated with an unsteady dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuator force. Phase-locked particle image velocimetry measurements at an acquisition rate of in double-frame mode are conducted in the direct vicinity of the plasma actuator, resolving 16 phase angles of the wave cycle. The use of two cameras allows measurement of two full wavelengths of the Tollmien–Schlichting waves and a detailed analysis of the cancellation process. The phase-averaged velocity fields of the artificially generated Tollmien–Schlichting waves are validated with a linear stability theory. The wavelength, amplification, and shape of the Tollmien–Schlichting wave disturbances and the counterwaves generated by the plasma actuator are analyzed.",56,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056610,"Free shear layers are building blocks of many flows of interest in applications, including jets, cavity flows, and separated flows. It was found several decades ago that free shear layers are unstable to small perturbations over a wide range of frequencies, that they are dominated by coherent large-scale structures (even at high Reynolds numbers), and that the dynamics of these structures dominate important processes: entrainment, mixing, momentum transport, and noise generation. These findings motivated extensive research activities to actively control their development using excitation of instabilities, but early experimental research focused primarily on the control of low-speed, low-Reynolds-number free shear layers. This extensive body of the literature is briefly reviewed. The authors’ recent work using localized arc filament plasma actuators in jets shows that free shear layers respond to the excitation over a large range of conditions that have been explored: jet Mach number (up to 1.65), convective Mach number (up to 1), and Reynolds number (up to ). However, the nature of large-scale structures, shear-layer growth rate, and generation of Mach waves all depend on the jet Mach number and compressibility level. The results clearly demonstrate the similarity of instability processes and development of large-scale structures in free shear layers, regardless of the Mach or Reynolds numbers.",56,5

The model of the flow through the neck includes linear viscous friction and nonlinear dissipation due to vortex shedding. By assuming a weakly nonlinear amplitude regime (i.e., essentially nonlinear near resonance but effectively linear away from resonance), it is possible to set up a solution, asymptotic for small excitation amplitudes, which enables analytically obtaining an expression for the impedance that includes nonlinear effects for frequencies close to the fundamental resonance frequency. (The higher harmonics will not be considered). This paper extends and refines the previous analysis that considered an acoustically compact cavity. Apart from a confirmation of the previously published impedance results in the small cavity limit, the new results establish a significant improvement in the comparison with experimental data and the asymptotic matching of the linear and nonlinear impedance regimes. This is in part due to the obviously refined model of the geometry but also due to the equivalent but numerically better alternative form of the asymptotic expressions that, by chance, emerged in the new analysis. Although both versions are asymptotically equivalent to the order considered, the new form happens to behave better for larger values of the excitation amplitude.",56,5

Unfrozen impinging water on the surface of the aircraft will run back under the effect of high-speed airflow, altering liquid distribution and heat transfer characteristics. In this paper, a series of experiments are conducted over a wide range of wind speeds , film Reynolds numbers , and inclined angles (, , ) to investigate the dynamics of thin water film on an aluminum substrate. The superficial morphology of the water film is investigated by a high-speed camera, and the instantaneous film thicknesses are measured by a laser focus displacement meter based on a confocal chromatic technique. The interface shape is found to consist of an underlying thin film and multiple scaled fluctuations; therefore, the results are divided into two parts for analysis: the mean film thickness and the root-mean-square thickness. A relationship between the mean film thickness and the wind speed, the film Reynolds number, the inclined angle is proposed. After nondimensionalized processing based on the triangular relationship, the averaged film thickness data agree with the previous model of an error within 25%. New correlations to calculate the interfacial shear stress and superficial roughness are suggested within the experimental range.",56,5

However, the low-frequency coherent structures inside the bubble, which have been observed in experiments, were not predicted by the stability approach. In the present work, asymptotic stabilities of the Grabowski vortex flow at are carried out to compare against previous works, and then the linear optimal inflow perturbation and the corresponding outcome are studied to unveil the dynamics inside the bubble. It is found that low-frequency inflow perturbations penetrate the bubble and are amplified to coherent structures, whereas high-frequency perturbations are convected around the border of the bubble. These linearized results agree well with previous experimental observations and are validated by direct numerical simulations.",56,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056528,"This paper presents a new empirical model for turbulent boundary-layer wall pressure spectrum and validates the new model against measurement data for zero pressure gradient flat plate flows and adverse pressure gradient airfoil flows. A comprehensive comparison and assessment of recently developed empirical models for the wall pressure spectrum for both zero and adverse pressure gradient flows show that there is no single model that consistently provides accurate results for different test cases. For zero pressure gradient flows, the Goody and Hu models are the most accurate. For adverse pressure gradient flows on airfoils, the Rozenberg and Kamruzzaman models are the most accurate. The Catlett model results in underpredictions in most cases. Based on the observed physical flow trend and the detailed assessment of all the models, a new model is developed. The new model extends the validity of the original Rozenberg model to handle zero pressure gradient flows and nonsymmetric and high-loading airfoil flows. The new model provides the most accurate results for flat plates and airfoils. A sensitivity study shows that the new model is not very sensitive to a variation of input parameters.",56,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056303,"The objective of this computational study is to quantify the influence of wall-normal and angular momentum injections in suppressing laminar flow separation over a canonical airfoil. Open-loop control of fully separated, incompressible flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil at and is examined with large-eddy simulations. This study independently introduces wall-normal momentum and angular momentum into the separated flow using swirling jets through model boundary conditions. The responses of the flowfield and the surface vorticity fluxes to various combinations of actuation inputs are examined in detail. It is observed that the addition of angular momentum input to wall-normal momentum injection enhances the suppression of flow separation. Lift enhancement and suppression of separation with the wall-normal and angular momentum inputs are characterized by modifying the standard definition of the coefficient of momentum. The effect of angular momentum is incorporated into the modified coefficient of momentum by introducing a characteristic swirling jet velocity based on the nondimensional swirl number. With this single modified coefficient of momentum, each controlled flow can be categorized into separated, transitional, and attached flows.",56,5

The paper aims at the transfer of this potential to an industrial full-size wind turbine by means of a dedicated suction system design and, hence, is meant to point out whether the predicted, airfoil-related improvements carry over to wind turbines represented by the N117, not hitherto in liaison with active flow control. Guidance is given through the different design steps involving the suction-followed blowing of the fluid and being continually dictated by industrial constraints and requirements. Because the processes of trailing-edge noise reduction and effective power alteration are intimately bound together, great emphasis is put on an accurate prediction of pump power requirement, with the latter being based on a detailed suction hardware system implying pressure losses across each component. Exploiting the limited installation space, a total trailing-edge noise reduction of 3.6 dB is coupled with a net enhancement of total rotor power of 4.75%. As of a cross-over noise reduction level of 5 dB, the enhancement of aerodynamic power no longer compensates for the pump power requirement and, hence, aeroacoustic demands are implemented to the detriment of aerodynamic performance.",56,5

Blake for the conventional stator–rotor interaction. Two primary mechanisms for interaction noise reduction are easily found based on a simple analysis of the formula, which are either to increase the order of the Bessel function of the first kind or to reduce the unsteady lift force. The latter can be realized by reducing the magnitude of the wake centerline velocity deficit or broadening the wake width, which are both related to the interstage separation distance. The aerodynamic and acoustic effects of inter-rotor axial spacing are studied experimentally. It is found that the axial spacing has little effect on aerodynamic performance of the contra-rotating fan, when the nondimensional inter-rotor axial gap based on the axial rotor chord varies in the measured range of 0.18–1.36. Sound pressure level follows an exponential decay law with interstage spacing, from which it is predicted that the three-dimensional rotor wake follows an exponential decay law as well and it decays much faster than the two-dimensional cascade wake. When the nondimensional inter-rotor axial gap is larger than 0.41, it has little effect on the noise level. On the contrary, the interaction noise is very sensitive to the axial spacing in the range below 0.41.",56,5

The freestream perturbation convected downstream in the wind tunnel to interact with a flared-cone model. The flared cone is a body of revolution bounded by a circular arc with a 3 m radius. Pressure transducers were used to measure a wave packet generated in the cone boundary layer by the freestream perturbation. Nine of these sensors formed three stations of azimuthal arrays and were used to determine the azimuthal variation of the wave packets in the boundary layer. The freestream laser-generated perturbation was positioned upstream of the model in three different configurations: along the centerline axis, offset from the centerline axis by 1.5 mm, and offset from the centerline axis by 3.0 mm. When the freestream perturbation was offset from the centerline of a flared cone with a 1.0 mm nose radius, a larger wave packet was generated on the side toward which the perturbation was offset. As a result, transition occurred earlier on that side. The offset perturbation did not have as large of an effect on the boundary layer of a nominally sharp flared cone.",56,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056053,"This paper investigates the effect of a swept airfoil design on the aerodynamic instabilities of transonic axial-flow compressors based on global stability analysis. An approach aimed at predicting the stall inception point is developed by integrating an improved blade force model and a new mathematical treatment method for steady flow. This approach takes both the concrete blade geometry and complicated base flow into consideration, which promises to provide a highly efficient assessment of the stall margin of a compressor in the design phase. Specifically, the relevant validation is conducted through a typical transonic axial-flow compressor, which shows that the predicted stall inception point agrees well with the experimental result. Furthermore, the compressor is also adopted as a prototype, from which a series of forward- and backward-swept rotors are modeled. Aerodynamic instabilities in the form of eigenvalues for each swept rotor, along with the throttling process, are predicted by solving the developed stall inception model. The comparison of the predicted results for these rotors shows that the backward sweep deteriorates the stall margin; the larger the backward-swept degree, the poorer the compressor stability becomes. However, the forward sweep does not exhibit remarkable and regular influence on the stall margin of the compressor in the present research. A discussion of the predicted results is made from the perspectives of blade loading and passage shock location.",56,5
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056575,"The newly developed flux-line theory identifies the maximum power harvested by a cycloturbine and the associated fluid–turbine interaction pattern. This work designs blade-pitching functions that maximize turbine power by identifying the blade lift coefficient functions required to optimally decelerate the flow, relating these waveforms to blade angle of attack functions through a novel semi-empirical curvilinear flow aerodynamics model, and finally computing optimal blade-pitch motions with freestream flow data from flux-line theory. At low and moderate tip speed ratios, the blades stall before achieving the required deceleration force. In those cases, more wind power is extracted by braking the flow through both the upstream and downstream portions of the cycloturbine. In a truck-mounted cycloturbine test, the flux-line optimal pitching kinematics outperformed sinusoidal and fixed-pitching kinematics. The turbine achieved a mean gross aerodynamic power coefficient of 0.44 (95% confidence interval: [0.388, 0.490]) and 0.52 (95% confidence interval: [0.426, 0.614]) at design tip speed ratios of 1.5 and 2.25, respectively, which exceeds all other low tip speed ratio vertical-axis wind turbines. Two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations show that the optimal blade-pitching functions achieve high power coefficients by evenly extracting energy from the flow without blade stall or detached turbine wakes.",56,5

The transmission system has a direct impact on the engine overall efficiency; thus, a performance optimization is an essential issue. In high-speed gearing systems, windage effects are extremely important and can dominate the other loss mechanisms. In this work, a comprehensive numerical study on windage losses experienced by a single spur gear rotating in an oil-free environment was carried out. Steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculations of the gear in free configuration were performed with conventional eddy viscosity models, comparing numerical predictions with experimental data from the open literature. The resulting modeling was exploited for simulating the same gear enclosed within cylindrical casings of various sizes, to assess the effect of the boundary walls on windage losses. The volume of fluid within the system was found to affect windage loss; therefore, results collected from the numerical analysis were exploited for developing a correlation aimed at predicting windage loss reduction with respect to the free configuration when the gear works within cylindrical casings. Finally, the predictive capability of formulation was assessed by exploiting experimental data available in the open literature, achieving a satisfying agreement.",56,5

A two-stream nozzle was studied experimentally and numerically in an attempt to identify the sources of such tones and explore remedies. Sharp tones occurred in a range of low jet Mach numbers . The source was investigated by parametric variations that included inner nozzle lip thickness, lip-to-lip distance between the inner and outer nozzles, and the length and geometry of the inner nozzle duct. Ultimately, it was inferred that the tones occurred due to a coupling between vortex shedding from the struts, which held the nozzles and the centerbody together, and various duct acoustic modes. Thus, with a thicker strut geometry, the tones occurred in a higher range (up to 0.85) because a given shedding frequency occurred at a higher , and vice versa. A leading-edge treatment of the struts was shown to eliminate the tones via disruption of the vortex shedding.",56,5

The coupling approach proves to be accurate and flexible in regard to the estimation of sound pressure spectra in a confined swirl combustor for different operating conditions.

According to previous studies, there are two possible factors: the Mach waves, which are radiated from the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, and the acoustic waves generated in the impingement region. To distinguish the effects of these factors, this study compares the following three results: the overall sound pressure level distribution, images extracted from the schlieren visualization movies using acoustic-triggered conditional sampling, and tracing lines of the acoustic intensity vectors of the Mach waves. The results reveal that the nozzle–plate distance affects the fraction of the Mach waves that are generated in the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, resulting in a higher overall sound pressure level in the upstream direction for larger nozzle–plate distances. It is concluded that the location of the plate relative to the source region of the Mach waves significantly affects the acoustic phenomena, owing to the variation in the nozzle–plate distances.",56,5

In the throttling process before the onset of buzz, the interaction between the ramp shock and the cowl-induced bow shock appears as regular reflection, Mach reflection, and λ-shaped pattern successively. It is interestingly found that the currently observed Mach reflection, which should have been broken down shortly after the emergence as reported previously, keeps fairly stable until the throttling ratio changes. In the remaining buzz stage, three types of instabilities of similar frequencies but of different oscillating behaviors and amplitudes are observed. The term medium buzz is adopted to describe the special buzz phenomenon with moderate oscillations. It is shown that both the little buzz and big buzz are characterized by the separation oscillation, whereas the medium buzz features the oscillation of the cowl-induced bow shock. Further analysis indicates that all three buzz phenomena probably share a common origin (i.e., the ramp-side flow separation). Also, it is demonstrated that the transition of buzz flows in the throttling process is attributed to the changes of disturbance strength and dominant role between two feedback loops.",56,5
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056361,"An experimental study is conducted at Mach number 1.71 on rectangular open cavity of length-to-depth ratio 2 with subcavity at the front wall. Subcavity at the front wall has been established as a passive control device. In the current study it is found that subcavity at the front wall can also act as a passive resonator. The dominance of fluid-dynamic or fluid-resonant oscillations accordingly causes the subcavity at the front wall to act as a passive control device or as a passive resonator in supersonic cavity flow. In the current study the presence of the fluid-dynamic and fluid-resonant cavity oscillations is clearly brought out and the inherent differences between the two types of oscillations are also highlighted. Fluid-resonant cavity oscillations are not often observed experimentally in most of the experimental works related to supersonic cavity flow. A total of six cavity models with different subcavity lengths are investigated and are also designated by the ratio of subcavity length to main cavity length (, 0.10, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, and 0.40). High-speed schlieren flow visualization and unsteady pressure measurements are employed to gain further insight into the flow physics. High-speed schlieren flow visualization clearly indicates the presence of six different types of waves and five different flow features that are associated with the cavity flow field. Statistical analysis techniques, namely, fast Fourier transform, spectrogram, correlation, and coherence, are employed for analyzing the unsteady pressure data. Fluid-dynamic-type cavity oscillations are dominant in , 0.10 and 0.20 cavities. Pressure oscillations inside the cavity are suppressed as is increased from 0.00 to 0.20. As is increased from 0.20 to 0.25, the type of cavity oscillations changes from fluid-dynamic to fluid-resonant. This change in the type of cavity oscillations results in increased pressure oscillations inside the cavity for , 0.30, and 0.40. Distinct cavity tones at certain frequencies in power spectrum plots are classified into fluid-dynamic mode and fluid-resonant mode. Modal frequencies of fluid-resonant modes differ widely from those predicted by modified Rossiter formula. Correlation analysis suggests the presence of fluid-resonant behavior in , 0.30, and 0.40 cavities. With reference to cavity, there is maximum reduction of 30.2 dB in sound pressure level for the second fluid-dynamic mode, and there is also 4.4 dB reduction in overall sound pressure level for the cavity.",56,5

In the present paper, two different approaches for buffet control by shock control bumps are compared and assessed based on time-resolved (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations: downstream positioning of two-dimensional bumps, necessitating an adaptive device for combining both features (wave drag reduction and buffet control), and vortex generation by three-dimensional bumps as “smart vortex generators”. With the intention of providing detailed insight into dominant flow features and linking geometrical bump characteristics to those flow structures, the effect of bump design condition, crest height, and streamwise positioning of two- and three-dimensional shock control bumps on buffet behavior and performance of a supercritical, unswept wing section has been analyzed. Two-dimensional shock control bumps improve buffet behavior by an efficient shock strength reduction in combination with positive effects on flow separation. For three-dimensional bumps, the same buffet-affecting mechanisms have been observed, only less dominant due to the finite spanwise extent. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the strength of three-dimensional bumps’ vortical wake can be tuned by appropriate bump shaping and that this strength positively correlates with delayed buffet onset.",56,5

Because positive leaders are initiated and can propagate in lower fields than negative leaders, in general, a positive leader would occur first. During propagation of the positive leader, initiation of the negative leader is favored through the removal of positive charge from the aircraft. Based on this well-accepted bidirectional leader theory, we propose hindering the initiation of the positive leader by charging the aircraft to a negative level, selected to ensure that a negative leader will not form. Although not observed so far, a negative leader could be initiated first if the field enhancement at the negative end were much greater than at the positive end. In this situation, the biasing of the aircraft should be to positive levels. More generally, we propose that the optimum level of aircraft charging is that which makes both leaders equally unlikely. We present a theoretical study of the effectiveness of the strategy for an ellipsoidal fuselage as well as the geometry of a Falcon aircraft. The practical implementation, including the necessary sensors and actuators, is also discussed.",56,5

A low-dimensional active subspace, when present, identifies important directions in the space of design variables; perturbing a design along the active subspace associated with a particular quantity of interest changes that quantity more, on average, than perturbing the design orthogonally to the active subspace. This low-dimensional structure provides insights that characterize the dependence of quantities of interest on design variables. Airfoil design in a transonic flowfield with a parameterized geometry is a popular test problem for design methodologies. Two particular airfoil shape parameterizations are examined (parametric sections and class-shape transformation), and the active subspaces present in two common design quantities of interest (transonic lift and wave-drag coefficients) are studied under each shape parameterization. The two parameterizations are mathematically related by a simple change of variable and subsequent odd-power polynomial series. The active subspaces enable low-dimensional approximations of lift and drag that relate to physical perturbations of the airfoil. In particular, a two-dimensional approximation of both transonic lift and drag is obtained and interpreted, where 1) each dimension is a particular linear combination of the design variables resulting in intuitive airfoil perturbations, and 2) the linear combination weights are related between lift and drag. It is shown how these approximations along with similarities between the lift and drag active subspaces inform a multi-objective design problem.",56,5

The associated closure models are based on multiple simplifying assumptions and involve numerous empirical closure coefficients, which are calibrated on a set of simple reference flows. Predicting new flows using a single closure model with nominal values for the closure coefficients may lead to biased predictions. Bayesian model-scenario averaging is a statistical technique providing an optimal way to combine the predictions of several competing models calibrated on various sets of data (scenarios). The method allows a stochastic estimate of a quantity of interest in an unmeasured prediction scenario to be obtain by 1) propagating posterior probability distributions of the parameters obtained for multiple calibration scenarios, and 2) computing a weighted posterior predictive distribution. Although step 2 has a negligible computational cost, step 1 requires a large number of samples of the solver. To enable the application of the proposed approach to computationally expensive flow configurations, a modified formulation is used where a maximum posterior probability approximation is used to drastically reduce the computational burden.

The system-level interface reduction technique aims at reducing the size of the assembled reduced model by extracting a few dominant interface modes. If the size of the interface degrees of freedom is large, the resulting problem is almost as computationally expensive as the one associated to the full model. Conversely, the local-level interface reduction technique reduces the interface of each substructure before assembly. In this case, the computational effort associated to the local eigenvalue problem is moderate, but issues arise when enforcing compatibility between interfaces. In this paper, the computational effort related to the interface reduction is significantly reduced by performing two variants of the multilevel Craig–Bampton reduction when the subsystems are assembled in subsets. This procedure localizes the interface reduction by applying a multilevel static condensation and eigenvalue analysis on each subset in parallel. The different interface reduction techniques are assessed on large-size realistic examples.",56,5
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056043,"Perturbation-based approximation methods are widely used in preliminary design studies of thin-walled structures. In this paper, postbuckling analysis of a variable-angle-tow composite plate is performed using the perturbation-based asymptotic numerical method, which transforms the nonlinear problem into a set of well-posed recursive linear problems. These linear problems are solved using a novel generalized differential-integral quadrature method, and the postbuckling solutions are sought over a finite load step size around the critical buckling point using asymptotic expansions. The accuracy of the asymptotic numerical method in evaluating the initial postbuckling of variable-angle-tow plates under compression is investigated. Subsequently, a novel postbuckling optimization approach based on asymptotic numerical method results is proposed for the design of variable-angle-tow laminates. The postbuckling features obtained from asymptotic numerical method are used in an efficient two-level optimization framework for the design of variable-angle-tow plates. At the first level, a globally convergent method of moving asymptotes is adopted to determine the optimal lamination parameter distributions that maximize the postbuckling performance of the variable-angle-tow plate. At the second level, a genetic algorithm is used to convert the optimal lamination parameter distributions into realistic variable-angle-tow layups. The optimization studies are performed for square variable-angle-tow plates for axial/biaxial compression under different in-plane boundary conditions.",56,5
