2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054656,"The tip vortex of a finite rotor blade-tip model undergoing pitch oscillations is investigated by means of a wind-tunnel study. The motion and flow parameters as well as the model geometry were adapted to rotorcraft applications, including test cases with fully attached flow, light dynamic stall, and deep dynamic stall. High-speed particle image velocimetry was used to study the spatiotemporal behavior of the tip wake at different streamwise positions. Combined with surface pressure measurements, the data establish a connection between the sectional lift of the model and the vortex parameters (for example, swirl velocity and circulation), including dynamic phenomena like hysteresis and vortex breakdown during stalled flow conditions. For pitch oscillations below static stall limit, only small hysteresis effects were observed, and the vortex structure is similar to static reference measurements. Beyond static stall, the tip vortex retains its general structure in a time-averaged or phase-averaged frame, but the instantaneous flowfields reveal an increasing influence of turbulence. Dynamic stall cases exhibit a circulation overshoot beyond static levels during the upstroke and a disorganized and less-compact vortex structure during the downstroke.",54,10

The idea is that, by optimizing its dispersion properties, a standard second-order method can be improved significantly for such flows. The key is to include gradient information for computing face values of the fluxes and to use this additional degree of freedom to improve the dispersion properties of the scheme. The scheme is motivated by a theoretical consideration of the dispersion properties for a one-dimensional scalar transport equation problem. Then, the new scheme is applied using the DLR TAU-code for compressible flows and the DLR THETA-code for incompressible flows for simulations of the moving vortex problem and the Taylor–Green vortex flow. The improved accuracy for small-scale transportation and the easy implementation make this scheme a promising candidate for efficient scale-resolving simulations of turbulent flows.",54,10
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054957,"A new low-dissipation low-dispersion second-order scheme is applied to scale-resolving flow simulations using compressible and incompressible unstructured finite volume solvers. In wall-resolved and wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of the plane channel flow, the new scheme yields substantial improvements compared to the more dissipative/dispersive standard central scheme over a considerable range of Reynolds numbers. For general hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulations, a numerical blending approach is derived that uses a local sensor function to switch between the new scheme in the large-eddy simulation branch and the standard scheme in inviscid flow regions. After determining a suitable sensor formulation, the hybrid numerical scheme is applied to simulate a backward-facing step flow, for which satisfactory results and a reduced grid sensitivity are obtained. To demonstrate its potential in relevant aeronautical flows, the new scheme is successfully applied to hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulations of a three-element airfoil near stall and a rudimentary landing gear with massive flow separation.",54,10
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053958,"An immersed boundary method (IBM) suitable for aeroacoustic analysis is developed using the block-structured Cartesian mesh method called the building-cube method. The IBM using a ghost cell approach in conjunction with an image point is employed. A hybrid interpolation scheme combining the wavenumber-based method and inverse distance weighting method is introduced to the IBM. This method is evaluated using four test cases. The results of interpolation at an image point indicate that the wavenumber-based method provides more accurate results than standard interpolation methods for aeroacoustic problems. The results of acoustic scattering around a sphere show that the proposed IBM achieves better than second-order accuracy. In the case of noise propagation from a generic inlet, the proposed IBM is shown to yield more accurate predictions for the far-field sound pressure level than the inverse distance weighting–based IBM. In a different application involving the JT15D nacelle, the far-field sound pressure level based on the proposed IBM is in good agreement with the experiment and computational results reported in a previous study. These results validate the conclusion that the proposed IBM can compute noise propagation with a mean flowfield and accurately estimate the far-field sound pressure level.",54,10

Flow separation leads to increased drag, decreased lift, and unpredictable vibrations due to unsteadiness. On these systems, effective control of separation could provide greater maneuverability and performance, and reduced vibration. Separated flow is a macroscale phenomenon governed by complex flow interactions, but it can be controlled by microscale actuation. Recently, the emergence of closed-loop methods has enhanced robustness. Modern processors enable the use of sophisticated adaptive control methods that achieve separation control with adaptive models. This paper considers control of flow separation over a NACA-0025 airfoil using microjet actuators. Experimental results are presented for a novel approach to nonlinear model predictive control, referred to as adaptive sampling-based model predictive control, which applies the minimal resource allocation network algorithm for nonlinear system identification and the sampling-based model predictive optimization algorithm to achieve effective nonlinear control. Through pressure data and flow characterization from wind-tunnel experiments, effective and robust separation control is demonstrated. The method’s computational efficiency is sufficient for successful real-time experimental implementation.",54,10

One transport equation is introduced to describe the growth of the laminar kinetic energy in the boundary layer. In addition, another transport equation of intermittency factor is built to trigger the transition by controlling the source term of turbulent kinetic energy equation. Finally, applying the two transport equations to a shear stress transport turbulence model completes a four-equation transition turbulence model. Comparisons of predictions using the new model with wind-tunnel experiments of the Schubauer and Klebanoff flat plate, S809 airfoil, Aerospatiale-A airfoil, and DLR-F5 wing validate the predictive qualities of the new transition turbulence model.",54,10

Steady laminar mean flow is extracted directly from solutions of the Navier–Stokes system of equations, which is validated against computations of a compressible boundary-layer method. Furthermore, the routines capture separated boundary-layer profiles, overcoming the constraints of the conventional methods. The stability of crossflow disturbances is investigated using both the parabolized stability equation and linearized Navier–Stokes methods, and the effect of chordwise waviness of variable wavelength, amplitude, and phase is considered. Wavy surfaces are found to influence the growth of crossflow disturbances, suggesting that the onset of transition may also be affected by the variations in the surface geometry.",54,10

Detailed analysis of the experimental observations is provided. It is found that, although the second mode is primarily an acoustic wave, it causes the formation of high-frequency vortical waves. Moreover, the second mode interacts strongly with low-frequency waves, which leads to immediate transition to turbulence.",54,10

This paper investigates the optimal growth characteristics in the hypersonic Mach number regime without any high-enthalpy effects. The influence of wall cooling is studied, with particular emphasis on the role of the initial disturbance location and the value of the spanwise wave number that leads to the maximum energy growth up to a specified location. Unlike previous predictions that used a basic state obtained from a self-similar solution to the boundary-layer equations, mean flow solutions based on the full Navier–Stokes equations are used in select cases to help account for the viscous–inviscid interaction near the leading edge of the plate and for the weak shock wave emanating from that region. Using the full Navier–Stokes mean flow is shown to result in further reduction with Mach number in the magnitude of optimal growth relative to the predictions based on the self-similar approximation to the base flow.",54,10

It relies on the projection of the intrinsic equations of geometrically nonlinear composite beams on the linear normal modes at a reference condition, which are coupled with two-dimensional unsteady aerodynamics. The resulting description is suitable for nonlinear dynamic analysis and control design, whereas the description in modal coordinates links directly to linear aeroservoelastic analysis methods. Results are presented on and compared to cantilever wings and full aircraft configurations previously studied in the literature. Linear control synthesis and closed-loop nonlinear simulations are finally explored on a highly flexible flying wing under large-amplitude discrete gusts. Results show the ability of the proposed framework to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the aeroelastic system, while providing a seamless integration with linear methods, as well as its strength in identification of the dominant contributors to the nonlinear response.",54,10
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054640,"By adopting advanced beam models, this paper presents free vibration analyses of metallic aircraft structures affected by local damages. Refined theories are developed within the framework of the Carrera unified formulation, according to which any-order two-dimensional and one-dimensional theories of structures can be implemented in a hierarchical and unified manner. By employing Lagrange polynomials to expand the generalized displacement field, component-wise models of aircraft structures are implemented in this work. The component-wise approach provides a detailed physical description of multicomponent structures, since each component can be modeled with its own geometrical and mechanical characteristics; that is, no reference surfaces and axes, as well as no homogenization techniques, are employed. This characteristic allows accurate modeling of global and local damages within the structure. The results show that the proposed refined one-dimensional models can deal with the free vibration analysis of damaged aircraft structures as accurately as the shell and solid models. Moreover, thanks to the computational efficiency of the Carrera unified formulation, component-wise models are good candidates for providing the vibration characteristics of structures for a wide range of damage scenarios in order to create databases able, for example, to train neural network for damage detection.",54,10
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054359,"This paper proposes the criteria to adjust the polynomial order and the number of sample points employed in the nonintrusive polynomial chaos expansion method for effective uncertainty quantification. These criteria are calculated based on the total variations in approximated responses between different polynomial orders and different numbers of sample points to avoid Runge’s phenomena. The polynomial chaos expansion method adjusted by the proposed criteria is tested in analytic functions and then applied to the sonic boom propagation analysis considering the uncertainty in atmospheric temperature, humidity, and wind velocity. It is confirmed that the polynomial chaos expansion method with the proposed adjustment strategy can estimate the statistics of the sonic boom signature with sufficient accuracy and only 0.35% of the computational cost compared with the Monte–Carlo method.",54,10
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054664,"The radial basis functions (RBF) interpolation model has been extensively used in various engineering fields. All these applications call for accurate RBF models. The RBF predictions are affected by the choice of basis functions, whereas the proper basis function is problem dependent. To avoid the choice of basis functions and improve the predictions, this paper presents an optimal weighted pointwise ensemble (OWPE) to combine the locally accurate predictions of RBF models built with different basis functions together. The key to the success of OWPE is to construct proper pointwise weight functions for the component RBF models. At the observed points, the weights of one or zero were used to sufficiently highlight the locally accurate predictions of component RBF models. At the unobserved points, the optimal pointwise weight functions were constructed by using an optimized coefficient that can adapt to the characteristics of component RBF models. Numerical experiments on 14 analytical functions and an axial compressor blade design example show that OWPE provides more accurate and robust predictions. Additionally, OWPE performs better when having more observed points and component RBF models. It is notable that OWPE can also be used with other types of interpolation metamodels.",54,10
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054743,"Quantification and management of uncertainty are critical in the design of engineering systems, especially in the early stages of conceptual design. This paper presents an approach to defining budgets on the acceptable levels of uncertainty in design quantities of interest, such as the allowable risk in not meeting a critical design constraint and the allowable deviation in a system performance metric. A sensitivity-based method analyzes the effects of design decisions on satisfying those budgets, and a multi-objective optimization formulation permits the designer to explore the tradespace of uncertainty reduction activities while also accounting for a cost budget. For models that are computationally costly to evaluate, a surrogate modeling approach based on high-dimensional model representation achieves efficient computation of the sensitivities. An example problem in aircraft conceptual design illustrates the approach.",54,10
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054711,"Optimization studies of dynamic systems using high-fidelity numerical models necessitate a tradeoff between fidelity and the total computational time required during design. A gradient-based optimization framework is proposed for the aerodynamic shape and controller design of aerodynamic systems using computationally intensive high-fidelity models. Subject to some general properties, the framework offers flexibility in the types of simulation models used and provides guarantees regarding closeness to an optimal design. A nested optimization loop that allows for the partitioning of controller and plant architecture is implemented. The proposed framework exploits time-scale properties of the dynamic system model, closeness properties of partially converged iterative solutions of computational fluid dynamics models, and the continuous adjoint method. It is shown that combining these methods can improve the total computational time relative to finite differencing. An example of optimizing the aerodynamic body and control gains of a tail-fin controlled supersonic missile is presented.",54,10
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054860,"Surrogate models are used in many engineering applications where actual function evaluations are computationally expensive. Kriging is a flexible surrogate model best suited for interpolating nonlinear system responses with a limited number of training points. It is commonly used to alleviate the high computational cost associated with design exploration techniques: for example, uncertainty quantification and multidisciplinary design optimization. However, when the underlying function shows varying degrees of nonlinear behavior within a design domain of interest, kriging, with a stationary covariance structure, can result in low-quality predictions and an overly conservative expected mean squared error. This effect is often amplified by data collected adaptively and unevenly during iterative design explorations. In this paper, the locally optimized covariance kriging method is proposed to capture the nonstationarity of the underlying function behavior. In locally optimized covariance kriging, the nonstationary behavior of an underlying function is identified with a statistical test process and approximated by aggregating a finite number of locally optimized stationary covariance structures. Compared to traditional stationary kriging, the proposed method provides an efficient and flexible computational framework capable of capturing transitional system behaviors and imposing physical understanding in building a surrogate model. Practical significance of the proposed method is discussed along with numerical examples.",54,10
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054896,"This paper presents a study using zonal detached-eddy simulation to simulate the flow of a dual-stream nozzle. The nozzle design and operating conditions are typically those of an aircraft engine at cruise, although the external flow speed is not simulated. The paper focuses on the effects on the mixing-layer development and the shock-cell positioning of a low dissipative spatial scheme, as well as the interest of a subgrid length scale based on local vorticity, in the frame of mode 1 and mode 2 of a zonal detached-eddy simulation. Reynolds-averaged data are discussed in terms of mean and fluctuating quantities. Results are compared with experimental data. The dependency on the numerical scheme is demonstrated, and the advantage of the subgrid length scale based on the local vorticity is confirmed, especially for the development of the core mixing layer, which is triggered by small velocity differences. A spectral analysis of the fluctuating aerodynamic field is performed, and the salient results concerning the physics of shear layers and the interactions between shocks and mixing layers are compared with those provided in the literature. Eventually, the “automatic” mode of the zonal detached-eddy simulation (mode 2) is investigated and is found to provide similar results to the user-defined mode.",54,10
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054689,"High-pressure jet injection into quiescent air is a challenging fluid dynamics problem in the field of aerospace engineering. Although plenty of experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies have been conducted to explore this flow, there is a dearth of literature detailing the flow evolution and instability characteristics, which is vital to the mixing enhancement design and jet noise reduction. In this paper, a density-based solver for compressible supersonic flow, astroFoam, is developed based on the OpenFOAM library. Large-eddy simulations of highly underexpanded jets with nozzle pressure ratios from 5.60 to 11.21 at a Reynolds number around are carried out with a high-resolution grid. A grid-convergence study has been conducted to confirm the fidelity of the large-eddy simulation results. The large-eddy simulation results have also been validated against available literature data in terms of the time-averaged near-field properties of underexpanded jets. The turbulent transition processes are revealed based on the instantaneous flow features and are quantitatively resolved according to the jet penetration and maximum width. The vorticity analysis is conducted to understand the turbulent transition mechanism, and it is found that the vortex stretching term plays a leading role on the distortion of the vortex rings in the near field of the jets. The dominant instability modes of jets, visualized by helicity, are quantitatively revealed based on the spectrum and relative phase of pressure fluctuation. The single helical modes corresponding to a phase angle close to with the helices are dominant for nozzle pressure ratios of 5.60 and 7.47, whereas the complex and multiple helices for the other two higher nozzle pressure ratios are due to the superposition of the single and double helical modes. In addition, the performance of the coarse mesh and different subgrid-scale models on capturing the dominant instability characteristics in large-eddy simulation of underexpanded jets is investigated.",54,10
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054825,"Particle-laden turbulent flow is widely seen in the natural world and industrial applications, and thus studies on multiphase flows with particles are of great significance for improving the efficiency of industrial processes and environment protection. In the present study, the Euler–Lagrange direct numerical simulation based on the point-source-in-cell model was employed to calculate the dilute particle-laden flow in a vertical channel. The turbulence flowfield was obtained by directly solving the Navier–Stokes equation. The particle’s motion was described by the Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation, and the shear lift force and Magnus lift force were also included in the particle equation of motion. The main purpose was focused on the effect of interparticle collision, which was detected by using a deterministic method. It was found through investigation that interparticle collision has a significant effect on the particle-laden flow even when the particle’s volume fraction is very small [about ]. Interparticle collision increases the near-wall particle velocity. The near-wall particle accumulation is decreased because interparticle collision can not only promote the particle migration from the near-wall region to the channel center but also change interphase forces. It was also found that interparticle collision has little effect on the mean velocity profile and the turbulence intensity of the gas phase. In addition, interparticle collision enhances the fluctuating intensities of particles in the wall-normal direction and spanwise direction. In the streamwise direction, the fluctuating intensity of particles is enhanced in the very-near-wall region and the channel center, while it is reduced in other regions by interparticle collision.",54,10

The three-dimensional Euler equations with a gravity term to create a realistic atmospheric model stratified with altitude are numerically solved by solution-adapted structured grids. Computations are made to reproduce the Drop test for Simplified Evaluation of Non-symmetrically Distributed sonic boom (D-SEND) #1, conducted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. As a result, this paper describes the world’s first successful reproduction by direct flight-test simulation of the evaluation of a sonic boom strength. The computational results clarify the sonic boom propagation, including the three-dimensional structure of the shock wave in the real environmental condition. Moreover, the results of the full-field simulations are in good agreement with those of the waveform parameter method, which is a representative prediction method for sonic booms, and the flight-test data in the D-SEND database provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.",54,10
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054762,"The modeling capabilities of TURBO, an existing turbomachinery analysis code, have been extended to include the ability to solve the external and internal flow fields of a boundary-layer ingesting inlet. Flow solutions are presented and compared with experimental data for several high-Reynolds-number flows to validate the solver modifications. The upstream flowfield was coupled to a hypothetical compressor fan to present a fully developed distortion to the fan. Although the total pressure distortion upstream of the fan was symmetrical for this geometry, the pressure rise generated by the fan blades was not, because of the velocity nonuniformity of the distortion. Total pressure profiles at various axial locations are computed to identify the overall distortion pattern, how the distortion evolves through the blade passages and mixes out downstream of the blades, and where any critical performance concerns might be. Stall cells are identified that are stationary in the absolute frame and are fixed to the inlet distortion. Flow paths around the blades are examined to study the stall mechanism. Rather than a typical airfoil stall, it is observed that the nonuniform pressure loading in the radial direction promotes a three-dimensional dynamic stall. The stall occurs at a point of rapid incidence angle oscillation observed when a blade passes through a distortion and re-attaches when the blade sees more uniform flow outside the distortion.",54,10

The study was carried out in a rectangular duct with a cross-sectional area of . The temperatures on four cross sections (45 measuring points on half of a cross section) of crossflow were measured using thermocouples. The temperature pattern of gas crossflow caused by the evaporation of hollow-cone spray was obtained, and the effects of factors such as crossflow velocity, crossflow temperature, spray droplet size, and spray injection angle on the temperature pattern were investigated. The main findings of this study were as follows: 1) The polydispersed hollow-cone spray droplets and the droplet-wall impingement made the heat transfer on the cross section of the flowfield inherently nonuniform. 2) The mixing flowfield fell into five regions characterized by different heat transfer mechanisms. 3) The temperature pattern of crossflow was significantly affected by the spray injection angle. 4) A good mixing between hollow-cone spray and high-temperature crossflow could only be achieved with a proper spray penetration depth.",54,10
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054958,"In the continual effort to reduce emissions and improve efficiency, moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution combustion has been suggested for aeroengine applications. This new application of moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution combustion requires further insight in applying the knowledge from conventional analyses of well-mixed systems to non-premixed flames. The ignition of ethylene, a key species in hydrocarbon oxidation, is simulated in simplified combustion systems with three different hot oxidants using detailed chemical kinetics. Zero-dimensional batch reactors, one-dimensional opposed-flow flame simulations, and planar two-dimensional laminar coflowing slot flame simulations are used to compare different ignition metrics across the autoignitive and moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution combustion regimes. It is found that the autoignition of ethylene with hot air may be described in two dimensions as the intersection of a critical hydroxyl fraction and the most reactive mixture fraction. Although this provides a reasonable prediction of the flame base for ignition with hot air, this becomes less reliable in the approach to the moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution combustion regime. For the cases in, and in the transition to, the moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution combustion regime, a good agreement is seen between a 10 K rise above the oxidant temperature and the onset of strong chemiluminescence seen experimentally.",54,10

A data-driven approach is used, in which the importance of filtering and averaging of the noisy wind tunnel data is discussed. It is concluded from the forced motion experiments that a good agreement between the single and multisine experiments exists. However, only the pitch experiments agree with predictions from Theodorsen’s unsteady aerodynamics theory. The plunge experiments show the presence of major nonlinear contributions in the measured force response. Because of friction in the linear bearings of the setup, it cannot be excluded that these are generated by the plunging mechanism or the setup itself.

Successive pulsed actuation is effected by momentary jets each having a characteristic time scale that is an order of magnitude shorter than the convective time scale of the flow. The actuators are placed upstream of the transition ramp between the ROBIN’s fuselage and the tail boom. The jet-induced interactions with the massively separated crossflow over the ramp and their effects on the global aerodynamic forces and moments are investigated using high-resolution particle image velocimetry that is acquired phase-locked to the actuation waveform in conjunction with simultaneous force and moment measurements using an onboard load cell. The present investigations show that symmetric actuation about the model’s centerline can significantly mitigate separation, lead to a reduction in drag and lift, and alter the pitching moment. Asymmetric actuation, and consequently nonuniform attachment, can induce significant side forces as well as roll and yaw moments that may be exploited for steering and improved flight maneuverability.",54,10
