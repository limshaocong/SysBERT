2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057328,"An analytical closed-form expression is derived for the shear correction factor of beams with annular cross sections. The beam theory is formulated using the variational asymptotic method, which uses inherently occurring small parameters to convert a variational statement from three-dimensional elasticity to an engineering beam theory without any ad hoc assumptions on the beam kinematics. Comparisons are made with existing solutions in the literature; then, the critical speeds of a rotor are shown to depend not only on the inclusion of transverse shear but also on the choice of the shear correction factor, establishing its importance. The motivation of this work is twofold: first, rotors that can be modeled as beams with annular cross sections are often encountered, and this expression for the shear correction factor can be readily incorporated into any rotor dynamics solver; and second, closed-form expressions, when available, always provide more insight into structural mechanics as opposed to numerical solutions.",57,10
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057564,"The present work investigates the nonlinear bending and buckling behavior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using variational asymptotic method. Considering a CNT as a slender beam structure, an asymptotically-correct nonlinear continuum beam model is presented. Through the resulting nonlinear moment-curvature relationship, the model captures the phenomenon of ovalization of the cross sections and local buckling of the CNT, which arises due to their geometrical nature. Further studies are performed in order to explore the effect of CNT wall thickness on the nonlinear bending behavior of the CNT structure. It is shown that the continuum modeling approach can capture the ovalization and further localization of the CNT deformation under bending. The study aims to provide a reduced-order modeling framework analyzing the inherent nonlinearities associated with the geometrical nature of CNTs.",57,10
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057569,"Free vibration analysis of rotating composite strip with delamination is presented. The analysis is based on the framework developed using variational asymptotic method, which is used to reduce the three-dimensional (3D) composite strip with delamination problem into a two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional analysis and a one-dimensional (1D) problem. This approach, in combination with the sublaminate method, delivers homogenized nonlinear cross-sectional stiffness of the delaminated strip with explicit delamination representation. For the purpose of free vibration study, only the linear cross-sectional stiffness obtained from zeroth-order analysis is used in the 1D problem. The 1D problem is set up by using the Hamilton’s principle to derive the dynamic equilibrium equations of motion of a rotating composite strip used in the determination of its natural frequencies. The approach presented is applied to composite strips of different layup configurations and delamination size to investigate their effect on the modal behavior of the strips. The efficacy of the results obtained from the model is validated in comparison with experimental data, other theories, and 3D finite element analysis. Apart from being computationally efficient, due to the closed-form analytical determination of the strip cross-sectional stiffness constants, the approach is capable of providing insight into the strip modal behavior by directly relating structural response with appropriate cross-sectional stiffness constants.",57,10
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057563,"Aircraft preliminary design and optimization relies on the dynamic response of complex structures such as wings. This analysis cannot leverage high-fidelity analysis that typically involves computationally expensive three-dimensional (3-D) finite element models. Complex structures can be reduced to one-dimensional (1-D) structures, known as stick models to decrease computational time. Instead, this paper presents a methodology for reducing the 3-D model of a complex structure into an equivalent beam-like model to obtain a set of elastic constants for its distinct cross sections using the variational asymptotic method. This is followed by the application of geometrically exact beam theory to obtain the 1-D displacements for the entire structure. A key step in creating the beam model presented in this work is the approximation of sectional stiffness properties for the equivalent beam cross section against the stiffness properties of its 3-D counterpart. A stiffness matching procedure is developed to obtain a stiffness matrix by altering material properties in the derived geometric model. This procedure ensures that the intricate details of the complex 3-D structure are not lost. Validation of the proposed model is provided by comparing against 3-D finite element analysis. Such a formulation is well suited for the design of any aperiodic, inhomogeneous complex structure. This methodology enables designers to capture features in a conceptual design that are typically considered only in the detailed design. Thus, it reduces the need for computationally expensive tools. The present approach is well-suited for an optimization framework and is being further developed as such.",57,10

With the use of variational asymptotic method, the nonlinear three-dimensional elasticity problem is divided into a two-dimensional cross-sectional problem and a one-dimensional problem along the length of the beam. This method makes no ad hoc assumptions but rather takes advantage of small parameters inherent to the beam geometry for solving the problem in an asymptotic sense. The material properties are varied along the axial and the radial directions simultaneously using two distinct power-law parameters. Analytical results for the strains, stresses, curvatures, displacements, and sectional rotations are formulated. The results obtained under different loading conditions and material gradations using the present formulations are compared with the results obtained using three-dimensional analysis in finite element software ABAQUS.",57,10
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057552,"Most of the engineering structures are built using beams, plates, and shells as the structural elements, and in recent times using laminated composite structures is increasing drastically. The accurate analysis of laminated plate structures is an important responsibility; to this end, there are different ordered theories developed by the research community. The variational asymptotic method developed in a mathematically rigorous method practiced by Prof. Hodges and group to analyze laminated structures promises the accurate analysis. A review of the variational asymptotic method employed in the analysis of laminated plate structures is presented in this paper, along with the brief review on other plate theories. The solution strategies employed by the different plate theories are briefly reviewed. A flow chart or tree structure on different plate theories and different solution strategies are presented as a quick reference for the researchers. The possible research areas or problems to be addressed using the variational asymptotic method in conjunction with different solution strategies are briefly mentioned.",57,10
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057429,"Unlike previous works, the present work implements the variational-asymptotic method to develop a generalized Reissner–Mindlin model for composite plates made of inhomogeneous and anisotropic materials. From a mathematical perspective, an equivalent two-dimensional plate model is first constructed through a dimensional-reduction procedure that involves the asymptotically correct energy functional up to second order in small parameters and with no specific restrictions on constituent materials. Next, to obtain a generalized Reissner–Mindlin plate model, a hybrid energy transformation procedure is applied from an engineering perspective. During this procedure, the unnecessary mathematical complexity of partial-derivative terms in the energy functional derived herein and obscure physical interpretations of mechanical boundary conditions in the plate modeling are systematically resolved. To evaluate the accuracy and capability of these procedures, three-dimensional recovery relations are established to predict the three-dimensional fields of the original three-dimensional structure. Several examples from the literature are presented to demonstrate the consistency and efficiency of the proposed approach.",57,10

The MSG is a unified theory for multiscale constitutive modeling for all types of composite structures. It is generalized from the previous research works based on the variational asymptotic method (VAM), including the variational asymptotic beam sectional analysis, the variational asymptotic plate and shell analysis, and the variational asymptotic method for unit cell homogenization. In this paper, the original complex formulation of the MSG is simplified and the principle of minimum information loss underpinning the MSG is formalized. The simplified formulation of the MSG is applied to construct the linear elastic Euler–Bernoulli beam model, the Kirchhoff plate model, and three-dimensional Cauchy continuum model. The connections of the MSG to previous VAM-based theories are clearly pointed out.",57,10

11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057591,"In this paper, a new concept for morphing composite blades is proposed, and how this concept changes the twist distribution of the blade is explained. A change in the blade twist is obtained by adding a mass to the blade that produces an extra centrifugal force. This centrifugal force then may produce a moment that can change the blade twist via the extension–twist or bend–twist coupling of the composite lamination. These types of couplings are present in antisymmetrically and symmetrically laminated beams, respectively. The dynamics of the rotating composite blade is modeled by using the geometrically exact fully intrinsic beam equations. The concentrated mass is considered as a nonstructural concentrated mass that has offsets with respect to the beam reference line. The nonlinear partial differential equations are discretized by using a time–space scheme, the converged results are compared with those reported in the literature, and very good agreement is observed. It is found that, for an antisymmetric lamination, the spanwise location of the concentrated mass affects the twist, whereas in the symmetric case, the chordwise position of the concentrated mass is the source of twist change. It is also found that introducing the concentrated mass to a real blade can change the twist dramatically.",57,10
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057603,"The generalized inversion-based canonical equations of motion (CEOMs) for ideally constrained discrete dynamical systems are introduced in the framework of Kane’s method. Upon selection of the inertia-scaled canonical generalized acceleration variables, the proposed formulation employs the acceleration form of constraints and the generalized inversion Greville formula for parameterized solutions of underdetermined algebraic equations together with the nonminimal constrained momentum balance equations. The resulting CEOMs are explicit and full order in the acceleration variables. Moreover, the geometry of constrained motion is revealed by the CEOMs intuitively by partitioning the canonical accelerations column matrix into two portions at every time instant: a portion that drives the dynamical system to abide by the constraints, and a portion that generates the momentum balance dynamics such that the system abides by the Newton–Euler laws of motion. Some insightful geometrical perspectives of the CEOMs are illustrated via vectorial visualizations, which lead to verifying Gauss’s principle of least constraints and its Udwadia–Kalaba interpretation. The procedure is illustrated by formulating a third-order CEOMs dynamic model of two particles experiencing a single degree of freedom, as well as a sixth-order CEOMs dynamic model of a three-degrees-of-freedom disk that is rolling without slipping on an inertial plane under the effect of friction.",57,10
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057479,"A dynamic instability analysis of fiber reinforced composite cantilever beams has been carried out in this study. Both experimental and numerical studies are performed to estimate the flutter speeds. Three different types of composite beams [namely, glass fiber reinforced plastics, aluminum fiber reinforced (glass reinforced aluminum), and multifunctional carbon fiber reinforced composites] have been considered in the analysis. A graphite fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite laminate with dimensions of is used in the experiments. The fibers are oriented along 0 deg: that is, along the direction of major dimension of the laminate. The experiments are conducted on three such beams by clamping one end of the beam to a heavy steel frame and leaving the other end free. The natural frequencies, mode shapes, and structural damping characteristics of each beam are estimated using the modal analysis through the fast Fourier transform analyzer. Variation of the damping and the frequency with wind velocity for each beam is illustrated through the and plots. The modal assurance criterion is also verified. Experiments are further continued to perform a dynamic instability analysis by clamping the beam inside the test chamber of a low-speed suction-type wind tunnel. The beam response at various wind speeds is captured through an accelerometer mounted at the tip. Based on the experiments, the flutter speed of the tested beams is estimated to be around . A numerical analysis framework is developed using the ZAERO code to perform the modal and flutter analyses. Numerical results are compared to the experimental results and are found to be in excellent agreement. Therefore, the numerical framework has been further extended to carry out the flutter analysis of the multifunctional composite beams, such as glass reinforced aluminum and plastic lithium–ion battery embedded composite beams. The multifunctional laminated composite beams are observed to have better dynamic stability as compared to the glass fiber reinforced polymer composite beams.",57,10
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057556,"A method to obtain geometrically nonlinear reduced-order descriptions of structures defined by a large finite element model is presented. The full model is used to identify all the coefficients in a modal projection of Hodges’s intrinsic beam equations, with the geometric reduction introduced through static or dynamic condensation along the main load paths on the original structure. The only information retrieved from the full model is the linear normal modes as well as condensed mass and stiffness and nodal coordinates. The approach aims to solve geometrically nonlinear problems of industrial complexity in an efficient manner, while preserving the linear model under small displacements. Examples of increasing complexity will be shown with the built-up finite element models made with beams and shells and both lumped and distributed masses. Nonlinear static and dynamic analyses, including rigid-body dynamics, are then demonstrated using the resulting nonlinear modal description.",57,10
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057501,"In this paper, the stability analysis of the elastic columns subjected to seven different types of the nonconservative force is investigated on the basis of fully intrinsic beam equations. The generalized differential quadrature method is used for the discretization of the first-order intrinsic equations and corresponding boundary conditions. Altogether, four important boundary conditions—simply supported, clamped-simply supported, clamped-free, and clamped-clamped conditions—are considered. Furthermore, the effect of the combined action of an end-concentrated force and a distributed tangential follower force is investigated. To confirm the validity of the proposed intrinsic formulations, the present results are compared with those obtained from classical formulations. Our results reveal that the fully intrinsic formulation is a suitable framework to model nonconservative problems.",57,10
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057489,"This paper proposes a novel spectral formulation for geometrically exact beams based on motion interpolation schemes. Motion interpolation schemes based on matrix, quaternion, and geodesic metrics yields simple expressions for the sectional strains and linearized strain–motion relationships at the mesh nodes. Consequently, the expressions for the nodal forces and tangent stiffness matrices of spectral elements are simplified dramatically. Furthermore, the motion formalism is used to describe the kinematics of the problem, leading to equations of motion that present low-order nonlinearities. Spectral elements based on Gauss–Lobatto and Gauss quadrature rules are investigated. For both cases, the combination of the spectral formulation with the motion formalism leads to geometrically exact beam elements that are much simpler to implement than their counterparts based conventional finite element interpolation schemes using a classical description of kinematics. A global parameterization-free generalized- scheme is used to integrate the equations in time. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed formulation. The elements based on Gauss–Lobatto quadrature rules are shown to suffer from axial and shear locking, whereas those based on Gauss rules are locking-free. The convergence rate of -node spectral elements based on Gauss quadrature rules is about to for all three interpolation schemes. As the number of elements increases, the proposed formulation becomes more accurate than its conventional counterpart.",57,10
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057227,"A scalar gravitational potential function expressed as a series of spherical harmonics frequently serves as the basis for a model of an astronomical body’s gravitational field. The contribution of an individual generic spherical harmonic to the gravitational gradient is expressed as a dyadic, which is then used to obtain an analytical expression in vector-dyadic form for the contribution to the moment of gravitational forces about the mass center of a small body such as a spacecraft. The expression developed for a harmonic’s contribution to the gravitational gradient can be applied in areas beyond the scope of the paper; for example, the gravitational gradient plays an important role in the state propagation matrix and the state transition matrix that are used in spacecraft trajectory targeting and Kalman filtering. Additionally, it can be employed in numerical simulations of orbit determination based on measurements obtained with a gradiometer. Contributions of spherical harmonics to the gravitational moment may be of interest in connection with attitude control of a spacecraft in the vicinity of a body with an irregular shape, such as an asteroid. Normalized spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 10 are obtained for the asteroid 216 Kleopatra and used in numerical evaluations of contributions to the gravitational moment.",57,10
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058676,"Slender deployable wings have attracted interest for use in Mars, Titan, and high-altitude flights. Such wings are composed of multiple bodies connected by hinge joints and can be deployed or folded spanwise during flight. A deployment simulation model is required for their design. This paper proposes a multifidelity multibody modeling method that uses a new asymmetrically gradient-deficient absolute nodal coordinate beam element. The proposed method addresses the drawbacks of conventional elements, namely, numerical locking and the need for a large number of generalized coordinates, by exploiting a structural characteristic of a slender wing. It enables computationally efficient low-fidelity rigid multibody simulation and more realistic high-fidelity flexible multibody simulation, both accomplished using a consistent modeling process and the same simulation program architecture. Additionally, the low-fidelity and high-fidelity models can be coupled with an aerodynamic model using a consistent coupling methodology. To validate the proposed modeling method, wing deployment experiments were performed in a wind tunnel at the Institute of Fluid Science, Tohoku University. The simulation results obtained using the proposed modeling method were found to be in good agreement with those of the wind tunnel experiments, even when the wings experienced large geometrically nonlinear deformations.",57,10

This load can inflict severe damage on the structure of an aircraft wing, and so it is necessary to consider the buffet effect in supercritical airfoil design. In the present work, the first objective is to find optimal profiles for minimizing the time-averaged drag and buffet magnitude. The second objective is to compare new airfoils and derive insights for transonic supercritical airfoil design to reduce buffet effect. The OAT15A airfoil is chosen as the baseline design, and then a numerical scheme is developed to obtain time-averaged aerodynamic coefficients and buffet parameters. A geometry disturbance method with smoothness check is introduced to develop a set of new airfoils. Simulations of the new airfoils are conducted to populate the sample space for surrogate modeling. A neural network method is used to build the surrogate models, which are then employed in a genetic algorithm to select optimized airfoils. Finally, the behavior and physics of the optimal airfoils are simulated and analyzed.",57,10

By doing so, one can exploit the modeling, solution, and postprocessing capabilities of Abaqus in aeroservoelastic analysis and design. To benefit from the computational efficiency of 1D modeling and the accuracy of 3D finite element analysis, a small area close to the boundary is modeled as a full 3D continuum and the rest of the beam is modeled as a 1D beam model. A geometrically exact beam model is then coupled with a two-dimensional finite-state unsteady aerodynamic theory and has been coded into a nonlinear UEL for Abaqus.

The methodology is applicable to compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational-fluid-dynamics solvers and is based on a harmonic balance nonlinear frequency-domain technique for modeling nonlinear aerodynamics in the frequency domain. Automatic differentiation is used to derive the computer code representing the adjoint gradient of the harmonic balance computational-fluid-dynamics solver. Discrete adjoint method airfoil geometric design nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic sensitivities are first computed for a benchmark NLR 7301 airfoil transonic aeroelastic configuration, and results are compared with finite difference computations to demonstrate the accuracy of the methodology. The airfoil surface is mathematically curve-fit using an airfoil parameterization technique, and the discrete adjoint methodology provides the gradient of the flutter onset or limit-cycle oscillation reduced velocity with respect to changes in each of the parameters of the airfoil curve-fit methodology for the cost of a single adjoint solution. This gradient information is supplied to a limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) optimization solver, which then determines values for the curve-fit parameters that maximize flutter onset or limit-cycle oscillation reduced velocity.

25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057183,"Body-freedom flutter characteristics of flying wing aircraft vary with engine placement. Here, we show why a certain design parameter (engine placement) influences the aeroelastic flight envelope of the aircraft. The approach is based on the constructal law and the principle that a design that avoids stress strangulations provides better access to the flows that inhabit the system. This is in sharp contrast with trial-and-error techniques such as optimization, which means to opt from among different choices, cases, and designs. Under the same flight condition, the flow of stresses through the aircraft wings is investigated for several configurations including those with maximum and minimum flutter speeds. The results reveal that when the stresses flow smoothly in the wings the stability of the aircraft improves. On the other hand, in the cases in which the engine location causes stress strangulation, the flutter speed decreases considerably. The most severe stress strangulation corresponds to the aircraft configuration with minimum flutter speed (i.e., engine placement at 20% span behind the reference line). The smoothest flow of stresses happens in the configuration with maximum flutter speed (i.e., engine placement at 80% span forward of the reference line).",57,10
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057456,"A computational analysis was performed on a straked, delta wing undergoing pitch motion in order to investigate the influence of shock-induced, trailing-edge separation (SITES) on simulated limit-cycle oscillations (LCO). The research presented herein describes an aeroelastic analysis of a wing oscillating in pitch using Euler-based aerodynamics with boundary-layer coupling (BLC). Results indicate that oscillatory shock movement occurs in response to the pitching motion of the wing, both with and without BLC. However, the BLC solution predicted more significant shock movement, and the inviscid solution predicted more aggressive shocks located further aft on the wing. Increasing the amplitude of the pitch oscillations resulted in a greater range of shock motion than lower amplitude cases, but variation of oscillation frequencies tested did not show any noteworthy differences. These findings support the theory that oscillatory shock movement associated with SITES can occur during certain cases of transonic LCO. In addition, based on the results from pure pitch motion of the wing and on the flow solver used, shock motion can occur without a boundary-layer model, although the modeling of viscous effects does affect the range of shock motion.",57,10

The aeroelastic code combines the unsteady blade element momentum theory, equipped with several important corrections, with the displacement-based nonlinear finite element implementation of the geometrically exact beam theory. The structural model is both shearable and extensible and does not place any restrictions on the magnitudes of the configuration variables or those of the resulting one-dimensional strain measures. The aeroelastic coupling takes into account the beam axis deformations, elastic twist, and vibration-induced velocities. The three-component, three-dimensional turbulent wind field is obtained using the Mann spectrum, from which the instantaneously sampled wind speeds are extracted by spatiotemporal interpolation in the spirit of Taylor’s frozen turbulence hypothesis. The structural and unsteady aerodynamic analysis components of the aeroelastic code are validated using benchmark examples. A fully coupled nonlinear aeroelastic simulation is carried out for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 5 MW research wind turbine. The influence of three-dimensional instantaneous sampling, transverse (lateral and vertical) components of turbulence, vertical wind shear, and flow unsteadiness on the aeroelastic response under turbulence is examined along with the effects of coupling parameters including the vibration-induced velocities and elastic twist of the rotor blades. The dominant frequency contributions in key aeroelastic response variables due to each of these effects are identified.",57,10

A novel mode tracking method is discussed in this paper using both left and right eigenvectors of aeroelastic systems.

The structure of the wing is modeled using the geometrically exact fully intrinsic beam theory of Hodges, whereas the aerodynamic loads are simulated by an incompressible unsteady aerodynamic model. The governing nonlinear partial differential equations are discretized using a time-space scheme, and the stability of the system is sought by evaluating the eigenvalues of the linearized system. The wings have linear or quadratic pretwist distributions, and the effect of various twist angles on isotropic and tailored wings is investigated. In this study, the effect of pretwist is considered on both the aerodynamic and structural models. Moreover, the effect of wing structure taper ratio in conjunction with the pretwist is investigated. The preliminary results obtained for a wing modeled as a clamped-free beam are compared with those reported in the literature and excellent agreement is observed. It is concluded that the pretwist angle leads to mode coupling and also has a significant effect on the flutter speed of the wing. By pretwisting the wing, the flutter speed of the wing with respect to the clean wing increases until a specific twist value and then decreases. Moreover, adding the pretwist to the wing decreases the flutter frequency. Finally, results highlighting the effect of bend-twist elastic coupling and wing taper ratio in combination with the pretwist angle on the aeroelastic stability of the wing are provided.",57,10
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058531,"It is shown experimentally that thermal nonuniformity can reduce peak supersonic jet noise while keeping static thrust levels equivalent. A thermal nonuniformity is generated by introducing an unheated stream on the centerline of a plenum containing heated air. This axisymmetric arrangement was studied with the hypothesis that the convection and structure of plume turbulence could be changed by perturbations induced by the thermal nonuniformity. The results for ideally expanded and overexpanded jets indicate reductions in peak narrowband spectral sound pressure levels upstream of peak directivity directions for nonuniform jets compared with the baseline uniform jets, even for a modest temperature difference between the core jet and the unheated stream. The mechanisms for this reduction are examined based on wavenumber–frequency analyses using the far-field acoustic spectra, suggesting that peak spectral energies shift to higher wavenumbers when the thermal nonuniformity is introduced. Convection velocities of radiating structures calculated from the spectral peaks show a reduction of 10% for the design jet condition. These results indicate that temperature-driven velocity deficits may be useful for developing supersonic jet noise reduction strategies, while even greater reductions are thought feasible by increasing the ratio between the heated and unheated stream temperatures.",57,10

Although direct numerical simulation studies published in the literature have predicted negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior in flames influenced by low-temperature chemistry and cool flames, it is believed that this work represents the first experimental observation of NTC behavior in burning velocity measurements.",57,10
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058522,"This paper investigates the aeroelastic system of an airfoil with freeplay in pitch, with emphasis on the subcritical limit cycle (LC) that appears below the linear flutter velocity. The lowest flow velocity for the onset of LC, called the LC boundary, is predicted accurately by the eigenvalue analysis of an auxiliary generalized Jacobian such that it has a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues. By analyzing the change in linear flutter velocity with respect to the remaining stiffness of the freeplay, an interesting finding is revealed whereby the lowest flutter velocity is just the LC boundary. Based on this feature and the generalized Jacobian, a mechanism responsible for the subcritical LC is elucidated, that is the flutter velocity decreases (but does not increase, as expected) with the remaining stiffness increasing.",57,10

The seeding injectors accelerate the particle aerosol through a converging/diverging supersonic nozzle that exits tangentially to the wall. Computational fluid dynamics codes using the multiphase application program interface particle tracking simulation were used to optimize the nozzle geometry in order to minimize impact to the flow and maximize seeding particle concentration. Normalized particle image velocimetry particle concentration profiles have excellent agreement with computational fluid dynamics, although the dimensional concentrations are higher by factors of about three and two for Mach 3 and Mach 10, respectively. This difference may be due to uncertainty in the measured laser sheet volume. Mach 3 experiments duplicated with global seeding indicate minimal impact of the local injection in the majority of the boundary layer. The boundary-layer thickness increased by less than 2.5%, and the relative errors in the mean and fluctuating velocities are within measurement uncertainty. The characteristic particle distribution of local injection is shown to lead the phenomenon of particle biasing. There is a high number of low-momentum particles ejected higher in the boundary layer but little to no high-momentum freestream particles swept back into the boundary layer. This creates an unrepairable detrimental bias to measurements above the point where the particle concentration diminishes: . Particle biasing is shown to affect mean velocity and turbulence statistics profiles.",57,10

Rapid simulation of the force and moment exerted by liquid against the spacecraft is rather important for the dynamics and control of the spacecraft. Fast numerical simulation models, especially those capable of dealing with violent liquid sloshing in the lunar soft-landing spacecraft with fluid merging and splitting, are required for real-time control algorithms. For this purpose, a modified smoothed particle hydrodynamics method, namely, noninertial smoothed particle hydrodynamics (NI-SPH), is proposed. In this method, noninertial coordinate system is used to derive transient external excitations to liquid. Meanwhile, the linear and angular momentum theorems of the particle system are adopted to calculate the force and moment exerted by liquid against the spacecraft, which avoids the accuracy loss of the integration of pressures. Furthermore, parallelization based on OpenMP is used to speed up the simulation. To show the accuracy and efficiency, results from the NI-SPH method are compared with those obtained by traditional computational fluid dynamics software, for several 3D liquid sloshing cases.",57,10
36,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058127,"In chaotic systems, such as turbulent flows, the solutions to tangent and adjoint equations exhibit an unbounded growth in their norms. This behavior renders the instantaneous tangent and adjoint solutions unusable for sensitivity analysis. The Lea–Allen–Haine ensemble sensitivity (ES) estimates provide a way of computing meaningful sensitivities in chaotic systems by using tangent/adjoint solutions over short trajectories. In this paper, the feasibility of ES computations is analyzed under optimistic mathematical assumptions on the flow dynamics. Furthermore, upper bounds are estimated on the rate of convergence of the ES method in numerical simulations of turbulent flow. Even at the optimistic upper bound, the ES method is computationally intractable in each of the numerical examples considered.",57,10
37,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058586,"The present study is concerned with the experimental investigation of novel complex surface treatments as a passive trailing edge noise control technique. The proposed novel three-dimensional surface treatments, composed of a combination of finlets with different spacings and patterns, have shown better aeroacoustic performance than the standard two-dimensional treatments in terms of the reduction in the surface pressure power spectral density, the spanwise length-scale, eddy convection velocity, and the trailing edge noise. Furthermore, the boundary-layer flow measurements downstream of the surface treatments have provided some insight into the mechanisms through which three-dimensional surface treatments affect the flow structures, which can help improve the performance of such passive techniques for the suppression airfoil noise at source. The aerodynamic performance of the plates fitted with different surface treatments is also examined using the boundary-layer velocity information. The results from this fundamental study can lead to the development of new generations of quieter airfoils with unconventional surface treatments.",57,10
38,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058068,"To show the effects of active feedback control on elastic wave metamaterials, this research is focused on effective mass density and sound radiation by a point force excitation. The expressions of effective mass density and sound-pressure level (SPL) are derived. The elastic wave metamaterials consist of double plates that are attached by the four-link mechanisms. To form the four-link mechanisms, the periodic structures consist of the lateral local resonators and the vertical resonator that is bonded by the active feedback control system. Based on the dynamic effective medium method, the effective mass density is obtained and the acoustic–structural response is presented. With the Fourier transform technique, the SPL of the double-plate model in the far field is shown. Results from a single-plate model with and without the equivalent method are compared. This work shows that the influences of effective mass density and SPL can be tuned by the acceleration and displacement feedback in the active control system. Furthermore, it is found that the acoustic–structural response and SPL can be changed by different active feedback control constants.",57,10

The time-averaged behavior of the interaction is characterized by mean surface pressure measurements inside the inception zone and in the quasi-conical region. The interaction dynamics are explored through unsteady surface pressure measurements, where the highest unsteadiness is observed near the intermittent separation and underneath the open separation bubble. Further insights into the unsteadiness are sought by examining the contributions to the total pressure fluctuations in three spectral regimes: low-frequency , mid-frequency , and high-frequency . Mid-frequency fluctuations dominate the current 3-D SBLI, in contrast to 2-D interactions where low-frequency disturbances are shown to be prominent. Finally, the interaction is visualized using high-frame-rate conical shadowgraphy (24,000 fps), where a shock identification scheme is used. The PDF of the separation shock locations revealed that it travels the farthest compared with the other two shock features. It is inferred that the smaller extent of the -shock is more probable, which is further confirmed by conditionally sampling the shock slope based on the movement of the separation shock.",57,10

First, the design method of osculating axisymmetric waverider has been proposed, and the numerical simulation method is used to verify the correctness of the design method. Second, three axisymmetric basic flowfields having different surface pressure distribution but identical shock waves are designed. And then three osculating axisymmetric waveriders are generated from the above basic flowfields, namely, decreasing-pressure, constant-pressure, and increasing-pressure osculating axisymmetric waveriders. The numerical simulation results indicate that the surface pressure distributions of the three osculating axisymmetric waveriders along the stream direction are similar to the surface pressure distribution of their basic flowfields, which verified the correctness of the design theory of the osculating axisymmetric waverider. The shape differences between the three waveriders are compared. Finally, the numerical simulation method is employed to analyze the aerodynamic performances of the three osculating axisymmetric waveriders. The obtained results show that the surface pressure distribution of basic flowfield has great influence on the shape and performance of the osculating axisymmetric waveriders. The osculating axisymmetric waverider generated from the basic flowfield having increasing surface pressure distribution has lower lift-to-drag ratio and larger volume. In contrast, the osculating axisymmetric waverider generated from the basic flowfield having decreasing surface pressure distribution has higher lift-to-drag ratio and smaller volume.",57,10

An accurate mechanical model is essential for all shape-adjustment methods. The shape adjustment of large deployable reflectors based on the reconstruction, finite, genetic, and tension (RFGT) method is addressed in the assembly phase. The RFGT method includes reverse reconstruction, finite element method, genetic algorithm, and tension adjustment. Combined with the method of subarea photography and splicing, a digital photogrammetry system is used to test the reflector surface. Interpolation is used for curve fitting, and the flexible rib is accurately modeled through reverse reconstruction. The finite element method is used to analyze the deformation regularity of the rib under the stress load of each rope. The relationship between the node shape accuracy for the rib lower edge and the rope stress loads is established. The optimal combination of rope stress loads is obtained using a genetic algorithm. The ropes apply extra tension loads to adjust the shape of the rib based on the original tension. The surface test data show that the rib lower edge is optimized after multiple adjustments in the assembly phase.",57,10
