1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059212,Takeoff trajectory computations are made for a typical small transport aircraft suitable for an urban air taxi. The selected wing–body model consists of lifting and pushing propellers. Flow is modeled using the Navier–Stokes equations. A procedure is developed to embed the trajectory motion equations in an overset grid topology along with rotating blades. Results are validated with lifting line theory computations. A typical takeoff scenario is demonstrated by time-accurately integrating trajectory equations with the flow equations. The present work extends the capabilities of the current Navier–Stokes solvers to simulate trajectory motions of urban air taxi configurations.,58,3

A specific algorithm based on estimating the cross-spectral density tensor with Welch’s method is presented, and guidance is provided on selecting data sampling parameters and understanding tradeoffs among them in terms of bias, variability, aliasing, and leakage. Practical implementation issues, including dealing with large datasets, are discussed and illustrated with examples involving experimental and computational turbulent flow data.",58,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058501,"A linear nonmodal mechanism for transient amplification of perturbation energy is known to trigger subcritical transition to turbulence in many shear flows. Feedback control strategies for minimizing this transient energy growth can be formulated as convex optimization problems based on linear matrix inequalities. Unfortunately, solving the requisite linear matrix inequality problem can be computationally prohibitive within the context of high-dimensional fluid flows. This paper investigates the utility of control-oriented reduced-order models to facilitate the design of feedback flow control strategies that minimize the maximum transient energy growth. An output projection onto proper orthogonal decomposition modes is used to faithfully capture the system energy. Subsequently, a balanced truncation is performed to reduce the state dimension, while preserving the system’s input-output properties. The model reduction and control approaches are studied within the context of a linearized channel flow with blowing and suction actuation at the walls. Controller synthesis for this linearized channel flow system becomes tractable through the use of the proposed control-oriented reduced-order models. Further, the resulting controllers are found to reduce the maximum transient energy growth compared with more conventional linear quadratic optimal control strategies.",58,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058633,"The present work demonstrates the use of a resolvent analysis to obtain physical insights for open-cavity flows. A resolvent analysis identifies the flow response to harmonic forcing, given a steady base state, in terms of the response and forcing modes and the amplification gain. The response and forcing modes reveal the spatial structures associated with this amplification process. In this study, a resolvent analysis is performed on both laminar and turbulent flows over a rectangular cavity with a length-to-depth ratio of at a freestream Mach number of in a spanwise periodic setting. Based on the dominant instability of the base state, a discount parameter is introduced to a resolvent analysis to examine the harmonic characteristics over a finite-time window. First, the underlying flow physics is uncovered and the findings are interpreted from laminar flow at . These findings from laminar flow are extended to a more practical cavity flow example at a much higher Reynolds number of . The features of response and forcing modes from the turbulent cavity flow are similar to the spatial structures from the laminar analysis. It is further found that the large amplification of energy in the flow response is associated with the high frequency for turbulent flow, whereas the flow is more responsive to the low-frequency excitation in the laminar case. These findings from the resolvent analysis provide valuable insights for flow control studies with regard to parameter selection and the placement of actuators and sensors.",58,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057572,"In this paper, transitions from convective to absolute instability in post-vortex-breakdown swirling flow with nonuniform density are investigated using linear stability analysis. Addition of swirl to flow in devices of practical interest achieves rapid mixing, but also renders such flows absolutely unstable, leading to self-excited flow oscillations. Through the spatiotemporal analysis, the onset of absolute instability is systematically analyzed in parametric space for uniform and nonuniform density cases. Five unstable azimuthal wavenumbers (, , ) studied show that, although mode first becomes absolutely unstable, it is the mode associated with the precessing vortex core that turns out to be more unstable for high swirl numbers and reduced shear layer thickness. The imposition of density field, representative of reacting flows, suppresses the absolute instability mode by shifting its onset to higher backflow velocities. Further, to investigate the cause of instabilities, a total disturbance energy equation is obtained with various energy feeding/depleting terms. Although the axial shear is the dominant production term, the alignment of pressure redistribution and density variation terms provides the necessary stabilization to weaken the absolute instabilities.",58,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058845,"Direct numerical simulations were performed to investigate crossflow transition control by the three-dimensional steady upstream flow deformation technique under the influence of low-frequency fluctuations. In wind-tunnel or flight experiments with discrete roughness elements, the fluctuations most likely arise from the interaction of the elements with background turbulence or base-flow fluctuations. If plasma actuators are applied instead, they directly enhance—unintended by discharge randomness—the low-frequency fluctuation level of the flow, degrading the control effectiveness that is based on inducing steady control vortices. To elucidate the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the promoted transition due to low-frequency fluctuations, the present work focused on localized volume forcing, modeling two actuator configurations, that is, plasma virtual roughness elements and streamwise vortex generators. The noise is introduced by modulating the steady volume force using a broadband low-frequency signal. Even when the steady control mode clearly dominates over low-frequency traveling disturbances, transition can still be significantly accelerated by the known secondarily amplified type III modes. Compared with the much localized active or passive roughness elements investigated in previous crossflow experiments, elongated vortex generators spreading over a larger streamwise distance diminish the receptivity of misaligned traveling modes and thus offer a better control performance.",58,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058317,"This paper presents two novel techniques to introduce source terms in the linearized Euler equations for the simulation of aeroacoustic propagation on a background mean flow. The first technique allows introduction of a prescribed disturbance in the computational domain through the use of source terms in the numerical flux of the discontinuous Galerkin method instead of volume or boundary sources. With this technique, it is possible to generate entropy hotspots, vortices, and acoustic waves in an accurate manner without generating spurious waves. The second technique introduces a wave-packet source with a band-limited spectrum to obtain, in one single time-domain calculation, the frequency response of the acoustic field over a wide range of frequencies. The formulation of the wave-packet signal and its implementation as an interface duct-mode source are described together with the postprocessing procedure required to obtain accurate results. Validation examples are given for the radiation of sound from a semi-infinite duct with flow.",58,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058000,"In aeroacoustics, spectral broadening refers to the scattering of tonal sound fields by turbulent shear layers, whereby the interaction of the sound with turbulent flow results in power lost from the tone and distributed into a broadband field around the tone frequency. Fan and turbine tone spectral broadening is known colloquially as “haystacking”. Recently a new analytical model has been derived to predict weak spectral broadening of a tone radiated through a circular jet. A key part of the modeling is the choice of the two-point turbulent velocity cross-correlation function, which is used to provide a statistical description of the turbulence in the shear layer. A new cross-correlation function for an axisymmetric turbulent shear layer formed by a circular jet, based on the theory for homogeneous axisymmetric turbulence, has been developed. Validation results of weak-scattering calculated using this correlation function show better agreement with measurements when compared with the results calculated using a correlation function based on the theory for homogeneous isotropic turbulence.",58,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058756,"This paper investigates the combined effects of high sound pressure level and grazing flow on impedance eduction for acoustical liners. Experiments are conducted in the grazing flow duct at ONERA (B2A). The impedance is then educed with an inverse method adapted to a shear flow. To take into account the effects of incident sound pressure level, a strategy for impedance eduction using a space-dependent impedance is considered. This strategy is applied to different experimental cases, and the results are compared with those obtained with a reference method in which the impedance is assumed constant.",58,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058456,"Airfoils operating in a turbulent flow are an efficient source of noise radiation by scattering vorticity into sound at the leading edge. Much work has been undertaken demonstrating the effectiveness by which serrations, or undulations, introduced onto the leading edge can substantially reduce broadband leading-edge interaction noise. However, most of this work is focused on sinusoidal leading-edge serration profiles. In this paper, a family of serration profiles is proposed that is capable of providing significantly greater noise reductions than single-wavelength serrations at optimal conditions. This new family of profiles will be shown to reduce interaction noise through a fundamentally different noise reduction mechanism than conventional single-wavelength profiles. Unlike single-wavelength profiles, which produce a single compact dominant source region per serration wavelength, these new profiles are designed to produce two or more dominant compact sources per serration wavelength of roughly the same source strength that are separated in the streamwise direction. Because these sources are arranged to be closer together than the turbulence length scale, they are highly coherent and, at certain frequencies, radiate exactly 180 deg out of phase, leading to very high levels of noise reduction in the far field. The experimental noise reduction spectra are first compared against an analytic model obtained as a solution of the acoustic wave equation using the Wiener–Hopf technique. This approach focuses solely on solving for an acoustic field, and not for any secondary vorticity induced by the edge. As such, this comparison, which shows disagreement, proves that secondary vorticity is a dominant mechanism for these new profiles. A simple supplementary analytical model has therefore been developed to explain this noise reduction mechanism for these new profiles, based on interference between sources distributed along the leading edge. Good qualitative agreement is obtained with the experimental results.",58,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058639,"Several methods for calculating jet–surface interaction noise have been developed recently and validated against laboratory measurements. However, further validation cases are required that include the effect of a flight stream. This Paper assesses the ability of the method of Lyu and Dowling to predict the effect of forward flight on jet–surface interaction noise produced by a laboratory jet. The main inputs to the method are near-field pressure measurements of the isolated jet, recorded within the flight-stream flow using a microphone with a nose cone. The predicted jet–surface interaction noise is then compared with measured far-field installed jet noise spectra over polar angles from 70 to 130 deg on the unshielded side of the jet. The results show that the model is capable of accurately reproducing both the amplitude and spectral shape of the jet–surface interaction noise up to a flight-stream Mach number of 0.2.",58,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057776,"Engine noise reduction using acoustic liner panels is an established technology in the design of bypass turbofan engines. Using acoustic impedance modeling techniques in aeroacoustic simulations, quick assessment of different liner configurations can be made. To minimize the engine noise in the best possible way, optimal liner configurations are ideally determined by employing numerical optimization methods. In general, to exhaust the full potential of the lining technology, it is desired to use a large number of design parameters in the optimization process. In the present work, a multilevel optimization framework is presented for the design of acoustic liner panels, which can efficiently handle large design vectors. The multilevel method combines a global search strategy with a local gradient-based optimization method. The discrete adjoint solver, which is used to evaluate the liner sensitivities required in the local search, has been developed using algorithmic differentiation techniques. This approach allows consistent treatment of boundary conditions in the adjoint part, thereby increasing the robustness and accuracy of the adjoint solver. In this way, the discrete adjoint solver fully incorporates the features of the underlying aeroacoustic solver, such as the impedance modeling and nonreflecting boundary conditions. The feasibility and the efficiency of the multilevel optimization strategy are demonstrated by finding the optimal liner parameters in a turbofan engine bypass duct configuration.",58,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058226,"Aircraft system noise prediction for advanced, unconventional concepts has undergone significant improvement over the past two decades. Prediction model uncertainty quantification is necessary to reliably assess the potential benefits of unconventional configurations, which can be outside the range of empirical models. This paper builds on previous work to improve estimates of element prediction uncertainties where the model has improved, or new validation data are available. These element-level uncertainties are propagated via a Monte Carlo method to the system level for predictions at each of the three certification points. Although the quantitative uncertainty values contained here are specific to the hybrid wing–body configuration presented, the underlying process is the same regardless of configuration. Comparisons with previous work show a reduction of 1.1 EPNdB in the 95% coverage interval of the cumulative noise level. The largest impediment for continued uncertainty reduction is the need for validation experiments and improved modeling of fan source noise, propulsion airframe aeroacoustic effects, and the Krueger flap source noise, which comprise the bulk of the uncertainty in the cumulative certification noise level.",58,3
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058459,"The forward flight stage of multicopters accounts for a relatively large amount of flight time in comparison with hovering, ascending, and descending conditions; therefore, understanding its aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance is significant for preliminary design, aerodynamic optimization, and control methodologies. By setting different rotation speeds, shaft angles, and freestream velocities according to realistic operation conditions, an investigation of a full-scale isolated rotor in a low-speed anechoic wind tunnel is conducted. When the freestream velocity increases and the shaft angle decreases, the thrust, power, moments, and sound pressure level (SPL) of the rotor increase by maintaining the same rotation speed. Through appropriate normalization methods, the loading coefficients and SPL collapse to one surface with respect to the advance ratio and shaft angle, and third-order polynomials are applied to fit nondimensional data. Using the fitted polynomials, power consumptions and noise emissions for generating the required lift during the level flight are calculated from different parameter combinations, and optimal solutions are suggested.",58,3
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058684,"This work introduces a fluidic oscillator design that allows control over the sweep and inclination angles, independent of the supply flow rate. These capabilities are made possible by injecting fluid from four control ports located in the vicinity of the throat of a feedback-type fluidic oscillator, thus avoiding the addition of any moving mechanical parts. Hot-wire measurements, water flow visualizations, and numerical analyses were used to characterize the fluidic oscillator. The sweep and inclination angles were calculated numerically and extracted from the flow visualizations. Numerical analyses indicated that the sweep angle can be varied from 17 to 70 deg, and the inclination angle can be varied up to 20 deg based on the amount of control flow applied for the considered control port geometries. The oscillation frequencies were observed to decrease with increased control flow rate by up to 5% for the variable sweep angle design and up to 7.7% for the variable inclination angle design. Also, the increase in the inclination angle was accompanied by a decrease in sweep angle, and the amount of this decrease was depended on the amount of the control flow applied.",58,3
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058681,"Large-eddy simulations of the onset of dynamic stall for a NACA 0012 airfoil, pitching at a constant rate, are performed for a chord Reynolds number of . Using four simulations, spanning , the effects of compressibility are examined for constant Reynolds number. The interplay between the laminar separation bubble (LSB), separation within the turbulent boundary layer, and compressibility effects is elucidated. It is shown that increased compressibility results in earlier dynamic-stall onset related to bursting of the leading-edge LSB. Because of this earlier stall onset, which occurs at the leading edge, the role of the turbulent boundary-layer separation in dynamic stall is diminished. It is hypothesized that fundamental changes in the transition mechanism within the LSB, due to compressibility, are the cause of earlier leading-edge breakdown. At a region of supersonic flow develops above the leading-edge LSB. A unique system of compression and expansion structures is observed and documented. It is shown that this system couples with the inherent unsteadiness of the LSB, resulting in a brief period of high-amplitude coherent flow oscillations, before the development of the dynamic-stall vortex (DSV). At this condition, an elliptical shape of the DSV is observed due to the presence of supersonic flow above and below the developing vortex.",58,3
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058709,"Time-resolved schlieren images and unsteady pressure measurements were employed to understand the flowfield characteristics of a rectangular cavity at Mach number 1.8 with a unit Reynolds number of . It was illustrated that the vortex dynamics in the cavity shear layer were found to be nonlinear, where the vortex speed was observed to be varied from to with an average value of . Unsteady pressure measurements inside the cavity revealed six tones, among which the third tone was dominant. The uniqueness of the flow features both outside as well as inside the cavity was studied for one vortex shedding cycle. Analyses using different techniques divulged that the occurrence of the first and second tones was due to wave propagation and vortex shedding, respectively. On the other hand, frequency that corresponds to one time period was correlated to the third tone. Further investigations unveiled that the entrainment of freestream between shear-layer vortices generated type 5 acoustic waves, which were responsible for the production of other cavity tones. The wavelet analyses indicated that the frequencies were amplitude modulated in time, and the wavelet spectra of the second and third tones contain high-energy events along with sporadic distribution of low-energy events without mode switching phenomenon.",58,3
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058580,"For a transverse gaseous jet in supersonic crossflows, the empirical formula implies that the jet penetration height will monotonically increase with the injection Mach number under a certain crossflow condition. However, due to the high backpressure outside the jet orifice, the penetration height will not go to infinity with further increasing the injection Mach number. In this paper, theoretical derivations and numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of injection Mach number on the jet penetration characteristics of a supersonic jet in an 2.95 crossflow. By proposing an approximation that the backpressure outside the orifice is equal to the pressure of the air inflow passing a normal shock, it is predicted that the jet penetration height reaches its maximum at the Mach number when no shock appears in the Laval nozzle under this backpressure. Furthermore, the distribution characteristics of injectant, the shock structures, and near-wall wake region features were obtained and analyzed. The simulation results show that changing the injection Mach number would significantly influence the structures of shocks and the near-wall wake features, which impacts the spatial distribution of injectant. Similar to the jet penetration height, there also exists a turning point in the variation trend of most structures, rather than monotonously changing with the injection Mach number. For the given condition, the quantitative analysis indicates that the penetration height approximately reaches its peak at injection Mach number , which is consistent with the theoretical assumptions.",58,3
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058589,"Temperature effects on the convection speed of large-scale structures in supersonic temporally developing jets and on the steepened aspect of the acoustic waves generated by these structures are investigated. For that, one isothermal jet at Mach 2 and four others at static temperatures equal to two or four times that of the ambient medium are simulated at either the same exit velocity or Mach number as the isothermal jet. For all temporally developing jets, steepened acoustic waves are emitted in the near field, leading to significant values of the pressure skewness and kurtosis factors. Using conditional averages, their formation is directly linked to the supersonic motion of large-scale structures at a convection speed whose ratio with the jet velocity is shown to decrease with temperature. At a higher temperature, this leads to the generation of less skewed acoustic waves for a constant jet velocity. For a constant Mach number, however, this decrease is compensated by the rise of the jet speed, leading to steeper acoustic waves at a higher temperature. Therefore, the modification of the steepened aspect of near-field acoustic waves appears to be related to the change in the convection speed in both cases.",58,3

This study experimentally investigates the flowfield characteristics of supersonic jets impinging on an inclined surface with nozzle-to-plate distances of and ( is the jet hydraulic diameter) and nozzle pressure ratios of 3.7 and 5.9. The two-dimensional two-component velocity fields were acquired in the central plane of the test nozzle and along the 45° inclined impingement surface by using a planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The flow characteristics of supersonic impinging jets, such as mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy, were computed from the acquired PIV velocity vector fields, and the statistical profiles were compared to study the effects of the impingement surface and on the flow characteristics. The obtained statistical results have shown the presence of shock cells near the nozzle outlet, oblique plate shocks near the impingement, and tail shocks along the inclined surface. In addition, spatial two-point cross-correlations of turbulent velocity were computed using the PIV velocity vectors to study the sizes, shapes, and orientation of turbulent flow structures in the impinging jets. Finally, a proper orthogonal decomposition analysis was performed on the collections of velocity snapshots extracting the coherent flow structures of a supersonic jet impinging on an inclined surface.",58,3

In the long run, this shall enable (for example) the simulation of a flight through realistic atmospheric turbulence, including the effects on the aircraft and the rollup of trailing vortices and their further development until final decay. A compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solver resolves the near field around a vortex generator (a rectangular NACA0012 wing geometry), including its boundary layer. An incompressible large-eddy simulation (LES) solver is used to model the atmosphere around the vortex generator, with its wake footprint in the LES domain being of primary interest. Two validation cases are presented. First, the method is partially validated with data from a wind-tunnel experiment. The second case is a vertical gust-wind simulation, which is compared to an already validated pure RANS approach for calculating the global aerodynamic coefficients given analytically defined atmospheric disturbances. The hybrid method proves to be powerful in cases where large-scale transient atmospheric effects and their interaction with flying aircraft are to be studied.",58,3
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058691,"This paper presents an efficient approach for modeling aperiodic flows in an assembly due to geometry distortions. First, a relation is established in physical space between grid displacement and flow perturbation based on linear theory. This relation is then extended to an assembly of components and projected to the Fourier space. A relation is thus constructed between grid displacement and flow perturbation in the frequency domain. Finally, the nonlinear coupling of the passage-averaged mean flow and the flow variations in the assembly is introduced. The capability of the proposed method is demonstrated on the outlet guide vanes of a gas turbine engine with harmonic geometry distortions. Good agreement between the proposed method and the whole assembly computation is observed for the predicted flow perturbations in the assembly. This paper also demonstrates that the harmonic flow perturbation due to each harmonic geometry distortion can be used as a set of basis solutions to generate flowfields related to new combinations of geometry distortions.

However, even state-of-the-art steady solvers suffer from convergence slowdown or failure when applied to challenging off-design conditions. This severely limits the reliable nonlinear and linearized turbomachinery aerodynamic analysis over a wide operating range. To alleviate the convergence difficulties, a nonlinear flow solver using the Newton–Krylov method is developed. This is the first time the Newton–Krylov algorithm is used for achieving robust analysis of turbomachinery aerodynamics in the open literature. The proposed solution algorithm features 1) the exact Jacobian matrix forming, 2) straightforward parallelization, and 3) a reliable globalization strategy; and it aims to achieve fast machine-zero convergence. The solver accuracy is validated using four test cases: an airfoil, a linear turbine cascade, a centrifugal compressor, and an axial compressor. Machine-zero convergence is achieved for all cases over a wide range of operating conditions without manual intervention.

Five different flame propagation modes—1) steady propagation mode (SPM), 2) jerky flame mode (JFM), 3) oscillating flame mode (OFM), 4) oscillating flame transition to detonation (OFTD), and 5) jerky flame transition to detonation (JFTD)—are observed experimentally with the increase of equivalent ratio. The results show that the oscillation characteristics strongly depend on the tube diameter and mixture composition. The results show that the smaller the diameter of the tube, the more regular and smaller the flame oscillation cycles and amplitude, and the greater the influence of the heat loss on flame propagation. Under the same tube diameter, the ratio of the heat loss to total chemical heat release rate in the five flame modes is . The coupling between the wall heat loss, wall friction, and the flame boundary layers contributes significantly to the observed different flame modes and the transition from deflagration to detonation.

The two-dimensional reactive Navier–Stokes equations, together with a one-step reaction model, are solved using a second-order-accurate finite volume method solver based on the Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement framework. The results show that, compared with one jet initiation, detonation initiation can be achieved in a shorter distance using two hot jets subject to the equal total width of the jets. When the suction slots are turned on, the overdriven detonation undergoes a gradual attenuation along with the weakening of the transverse waves, hence leading to dynamic detonation stabilization in the supersonic flow. When the suction slots are closer to the detonation front, the forward propagation of the detonation in the supersonic flow can be more effectively prohibited, implying that the suction slots should be distributed as close as possible to the detonation front in order to realize the maximal suction effect using the minimal suction slots.",58,3

However, the computational cost of obtaining the associated tradeoffs increases significantly when more sources of uncertainty and more outputs are considered. Consequently, visualizing and exploring the decision (trade) space becomes increasingly difficult, which, in turn, makes the decision-making process cumbersome for practicing designers. To address this problem, proposed is a parameterization of the input probability distribution functions, to account for several statistical moments. This, combined with efficient uncertainty propagation and inverse computation techniques, results in a computational system that performs order(s) of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art optimization technique.

Based on the strain model, the control forces of LaSMP patches on hemispherical shells are introduced. The FEM method is used to obtain natural frequencies of the free hemispherical shell by solid modeling in ANSYS and proved by comparing numerical results with analytical and experimental results. Using the modal expansion method, the LaSMP vibration control of hemispheres is investigated, and independent modal responses are presented and evaluated. The results indicate that LaSMP patch can control vibrations of hemispherical shells by reducing vibration amplitudes.

The objective is to explore the influence of the multiple actuator placements and optimal actuation locations. A multi-actuator mathematical model with any arbitrary actuators is derived. Case studies proved that the influence of actuator locations on the modal force is modal dependent. The optimal actuation location of mode (1,1) indicates all three actuators gathering in the middle of the plate. For mode (2,1), there were two sets of optimal locations located at the peaks of its mode shape, respectively. The multi-actuator method has significant advantages on actuation capability and can alleviate the stress concentrations caused by the single-actuator method.",58,3

The primary novelty in this work is the deployable rigid frame covered with flexible membranes. The deployable system has a large folding ratio as well as reliable driving and locking systems. Kinematic equations were established with relevant constraint formulas for the rigid bodies using Moore–Penrose generalized inverse matrix, whereas the vector finite element method was employed for the flexible membrane. Meanwhile, dynamic analysis confirmed the structural stiffness. Finally, a model of the deployable optical baffle was fabricated and assembled, of which the successful and stable deployment shows the feasibility of the deployable scheme. Therefore, the proposed deployable optical baffle provides theoretical guidance and methodological support for the design of large space telescopes.",58,3
