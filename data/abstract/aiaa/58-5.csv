The correction is simple and only alters the constant, so that the calibration of the original model in free shear flows and in high-Reynolds-number boundary layers is preserved. Its effect vanishes for momentum-thickness Reynolds number larger than about 5000, in the flat-plate boundary layer. Below 5000, the agreement with experiment for skin friction is strongly improved, and the differences, which reach 15% for the original Spalart–Allmaras model, are now of the order of the experimental uncertainty. The alteration of the logarithmic law is negligible. Ultimately at very high Reynolds number, the new model shifts the curve of versus the streamwise Reynolds number to the left by units of . On the other hand, the effect on channel flow is to introduce an excess of skin friction of a few percent.",58,5

A wide range of angles of attack [; 32°] is investigated for 3 values of the Reynolds number across the transitional range. Unusual polar curves are observed with sharp variations of lift with the angle of attack. At low incidence, the lift coefficient increases faster than . Moreover, very different behaviors occur for Reynolds numbers lower or higher than . For small or negative angles of attack, the lift coefficient is negative (downward lift) at small Reynolds numbers, but positive (upward lift) at higher Reynolds numbers. The velocity field is investigated with particle image velocimetry. Variations of lift are related to changes in the topology of the flowfield around the section. These results help to better understand the flow around a high-camber thin section and provide a detailed benchmark database in a simple geometry for model validations. As strong Reynolds number effects are evidenced, this database would be particularly useful to assess the performance of transition models.",58,5

These aircraft fly below a Reynolds number of 250,000, where, in clean flow, the wing boundary layer undergoes laminar-to-turbulent transition for a significant portion of the wing chord. However, many UAVs fly at low altitude, where significant levels of turbulence are encountered due to terrain roughness. The present study was carried out to understand how this turbulent flow changes the performance of the UAV wing—in particular, how this influence may vary with the camber of the airfoil form. Two airfoils, a NACA0012 and a NACA4412, were tested in relatively clean and highly turbulent flows in a wind tunnel. Testing was conducted at Reynolds numbers of 50,000–200,000, with turbulence intensities from 1.3 to 15%. Under increasing turbulence intensities, in contrast to prior flat plate research, the maximum lift coefficient was seen to decrease by up to 30% for the cambered airfoil, compared with a 5% rise for the symmetrical form. The influence of the Reynolds number on both airfoils decreased as the turbulence intensity increased, whereas camber maintained a point of difference.",58,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059026,"Kinematic aspects of flow separation in external aerodynamics are investigated in the Lagrangian frame. Specifically, the initial motion of upwelling fluid material from the wall is related to the long-term attracting manifolds in the flowfield. Although the short-time kinematics are governed by the formation of a material spike upstream of the zero-skin-friction point and ejection of particles in the direction of the asymptotic separation line, the trajectories of the fluid tracers are guided by attracting ridges in the finite-time Lyapunov exponents once they leave the vicinity of the wall. The wall signature of this initial fluid upwelling event, which is the so-called spiking point (Serra, M., Vetel, J., and Haller, G., “Exact Theory of Material Spike Formation in Flow Separation,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 845, June 2018, pp. 51–92), is computed from the curvature of advected material lines and, for the first time, from high-order numerical derivatives of the wall-normal velocity obtained from direct numerical simulations of a circular cylinder and a cambered NACA 65(1)-412 airfoil. As the spline-based boundary parametrization of the airfoil profile induces oscillations, the principle spiking point can be recovered robustly through appropriate filtering. The short-term kinematics correlate strongly with the scaling lengths in the boundary layer.",58,5

Therefore, it needs to be avoided. With the aim of solving the vibration problem of the long cantilever sting used in wind tunnels, an active sting damper based on piezoelectric stacks is designed and its principle of controlling vibration is analyzed in this paper. To improve the damping effect and ensure the safety of wind-tunnel tests, a controller based on neural networks that is able to suppress multimodal vibration is detailed and established. A hardware platform composed of various instruments is developed, and related testing software is built to evaluate the damper as well as the control algorithm. Finally, broadband excitation and transonic wind-tunnel tests are carried out to verify the capability of the whole damping system. Experimental results indicate that the amplitude of vibration is dramatically reduced and the test angles of attack are enlarged, which show the superiority of the damper and the control algorithm.",58,5

A comprehensive evaluation of the performance may consider hundreds or even thousands of flight conditions, and this leads to a massively multipoint optimization problem. Existing optimization methods are inefficient in such cases. This paper presents a surrogate-assisted gradient-based optimization architecture that efficiently solves massively multipoint design problems. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, surrogate models are constructed only in the low-dimensional space spanned by flow condition variables. With the aerodynamic functions and gradients computed by surrogate models, efficient gradient-based optimization is performed to find the optimal design. To ensure convergence, an adaptive sampling criterion is proposed to refine the surrogate models. In a transonic aircraft wing design case, the results show that the optimal design found by the proposed method with 342 missions yields a fuel burn reduction by a factor of two as compared to a regular multipoint optimal design. This work highlights the demand and provides an efficient way to conduct massively multipoint optimization in aircraft design.",58,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058840,"In modern aircraft design the accurate prediction of dynamic control surface deflections is crucial for the evaluation and application of new load alleviation techniques. Time-marching approaches, such as the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, do provide a complete modeling of the aerodynamic flowfield; however, they are extremely time-consuming and still too expensive for design applications. In this paper a model is presented, which enables the fast and accurate prediction of aerodynamic responses for arbitrary control surface deflections. The model hereby reflects the time signal of the control surface deflection as a superposition of frequency components and computes the dynamic response behavior of the control surface using the linear frequency domain. The frequency responses are precomputed in a surrogate model for a wide parameter space of Mach number, Reynolds number, angle of attack and flap chord ratio, so that a frequency response for a new flight condition can be computed by mere interpolation. After building the surrogate model, the method achieves reduction in computational time of up to six orders of magnitude in comparison to time-marching simulations, while still covering the viscous and unsteady aerodynamic effects in the flow.",58,5

The nonlinear limit cycle oscillation (LCO) of a NACA0012 airfoil with control surface free-play behavior is considered to illustrate how this adaptive step can achieve a balance between the stability, accuracy, and efficiency in the modes crossing region in modes tracking, the flutter point region in modes tracking, and the detrimental LCO region in parameter variation. It is shown that the computation time for modes tracking using this approach can be reduced by more than 65% while achieving almost the same estimate of the flutter speed as when using a fixed step size. The study also addresses a few unique and important phenomena in parameter variation such as modes jumping in the LCO curve that occur frequently using this adaptive step size algorithm. Furthermore, a combination of the modes tracking results to provide an estimate for the restart point for the CM solver to overcome the occurrence of possible extraneous solutions or divergence is proposed. The results of flutter analysis for linear structural system and nonlinear LCO analysis are validated against the results from experiments and the classical Theodorsen theory. The effect of viscous damping on the occurrence of detrimental LCO phenomena is also discussed and compared with the corresponding nondamping cases.",58,5

The goal of this work is to perform real-time, but realistic, flight simulations and trajectory planning for quad-copters in low-altitude (<500 m) atmospheric conditions. The aerodynamic model for rotor performance is adapted from blade element momentum theory and validated against experimental data. Large-eddy simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer are used to accurately represent the operating environment of unmanned air vehicles. A reduced-order version of the atmospheric boundary-layer data as well as the popular Dryden model are used to assess the impact of accuracy of the wind-field model on the predicted vehicle performance and trajectory. The wind model, aerodynamics, and control modules are integrated into a six-degree-of-freedom flight simulation environment with a fully nonlinear flight controller. Simulations are performed for two representative flight paths, namely, straight and circular paths. Results for different wind models are compared and the impact of simplifying assumptions in representing rotor aerodynamics is discussed.

10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058877,"The aerodynamic noise generated by a circular cylinder in a crossflow is a classical problem in aeroacoustics, which can be found in various practical applications, such as parts of the landing gear of airplanes, train pantographs, and antennas of vehicles. The noise is especially disturbing because it contains strong tonal contributions due to the regular vortex shedding at the cylinder. If the cylinders are not two-dimensional, but finite and wall-mounted at one end and free at the other, additional flow phenomena occur at both the tip and the wall junction, which can lead to additional noise contributions. One method to reduce the aerodynamic noise from such cylinders is to cover them with a flow-permeable, porous material. The present paper describes an experimental study on the effect of porous covers on the reduction of noise generated by wall-mounted, finite, circular cylinders. Thereby, special focus was put on the identification of both the optimum position and the optimum extent of the porous cover regarding a maximum noise reduction. The experiments included both measurements of the far field noise as well as flow measurements in the wake of the cylinders. They were conducted in an aeroacoustic open jet wind tunnel at subsonic flow speeds. It was found that a placement of porous material at the wall end is more efficient in reducing Kármán vortex shedding noise than a placement of porous material at the free end.",58,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058236,"An acoustic relaxation term for the momentum equation is introduced that can act as a damping or forcing term for pressure waves while leaving other modes untouched. This acoustic relaxation term can be seen as the acoustic variant of the eddy relaxation term previously introduced in other work, and therefore shares several important characteristics. Its damping behavior is shown to be favorably frequency selective; that is, application to a test case with spurious acoustics shows that, indeed, the acoustic relaxation term is able to remove these undesired oscillations while leaving the hydrodynamics untouched. Subsequently, the acoustic relaxation term is applied as a forcing to couple an acoustic signal into a computational aeroacoustics (CAA) simulation. The transfer function shows a desirable behavior. The acoustic relaxation term is able to damp or excite acoustic waves; in that way, it potentially enables the excitement of prescribed acoustics in the linearized equations, such as a linearized Euler or acoustic perturbation or, as is done in this paper, the Navier–Stokes equations.",58,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059047,"The investigation focuses on the forcing of a fully developed turbulent channel flow through a linear array of synthetic jets injected tangentially to the wall and orthogonal to the mean flow direction. Forcing configurations are varied by differently combining the number of actuated jets working in an opposing blowing–suction configuration. Instantaneous wall shear stress and streamwise velocity fluctuations evidence drag reductions as well as turbulence attenuation up to 20%. The forcing effects are persistent up to at least a 150 half-channel height downstream of the injection section. Particle image velocimetry investigations in planes perpendicular to the channel axis highlight the presence of a large-scale streamwise vortical structure covering the whole height of the channel. This structure is thought to be responsible for the significant drag reduction, which is similar to the typical behavior evidenced in the case of colliding jets. The nondimensional forcing frequency of the synthetic jets producing the maximum drag reduction and turbulence attenuation is 0.0074 for the investigated Reynolds number . A statistical analysis of the near-wall structures demonstrates that the control mechanism acts in a way to reduce them in the forced configuration. It is conclude that the effect of the forcing is such that the near-wall structures merge and become less prone to inducing new structures, thus effectively reducing their number, and consequently the near-wall turbulence activity.",58,5

High-lift airfoils employ trailing edge flaps during takeoff and landing, which are stowed during cruise. The present experimental investigation was carried out to examine the active flow control effectiveness on the NASA Energy Efficient Transport airfoil fitted with a simple hinged flap. Experiments were carried out at two flap deflection angles of 20 and 30° at a Reynolds number based on aerodynamic chord of . The microjet parameters varied during this study were the location, orientation, and blowing ratio of the jets. Measurements include velocity and vorticity fields obtained using planar and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The baseline flow is separated over a third of the flap at a deflection angle of 20°, and over the entire flap at a deflection angle of 30°. Microjet control is able to completely re-attach the flow at both flap deflection angles and significantly reduce the airfoil drag. The mechanism for control effectiveness is the re-energizing of the boundary layer through the development of counter-rotating vortex pairs.",58,5
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059014,"A control method is developed to suppress pressure oscillations induced by supersonic cavity flow using high-speed upstream injection. The injection is generated with a large blowing coefficient through a channel, which guides the airflow blowing off in the leading edge of the cavity. Wind tunnel experiments are performed to validate the method with Mach 1.8 and 2.0 flows over a length-to-depth 6 cavity. Six dynamic pressure transducers are used to characterize the cavity oscillation. A remarkable suppression of pressure fluctuation is realized in the controlled cavity flow. The overall sound pressure level can be reduced by larger than 10 dB in both configurations. The most remarkable reduction in pressure fluctuation occurs near the cavity trailing edge, wherein flow-induced oscillation is strongest. Almost no cavity tones are observed near the cavity trailing edge under control. Further, the control method is proven effective and stable over time. The feedback loop is interrupted in the controlled cavity flow with a weak impact of shear vortices on the cavity aft wall. The control method may be a practical and potential candidate for use in engineering applications because it does not need additional gas supply in the control system.",58,5
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058471,"High-speed particle-image velocimetry measurements and temperature measurements are performed to investigate the interaction of shock waves with film cooling flows at varying injection temperature. A laminar jet is tangentially injected beneath a turbulent boundary layer at a freestream Mach number . Two cooling film injection Mach numbers are considered, at a total temperature ratio and at a total temperature ratio . For the low injection Mach number, the shock is generated by a flow deflection of ; for the high injection Mach number, the flow deflection angle is . For both injection Mach numbers, two shock impingement positions are investigated. For comparison, literature data with comparable shock parameters and isoenergetic injection are considered. The current results show that the flow structure of the shock/cooling-film interaction is highly sensitive to the injection temperature. The increased blowing rate at a lower injection temperature, that is, increased streamwise mass flux in the cooling film, drastically stabilizes the flow. This prevents mean separation and leads to reduced turbulent mixing downstream of the shock interaction region. In consequence, the turbulent heat transport toward the wall decreases, which implies a higher cooling effectiveness when the injection temperature decreases. The findings also show that flow cases with different injection temperatures but similar near-wall mass flux yield separation bubbles with similar streamwise extent.",58,5

A model with interchangeable nosetips was designed and fabricated from stainless steel, polyether ether ketone (PEEK), and Macor®. Transition on the model was characterized using infrared thermography and Kulite pressure transducers in the Boeing/U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel at Purdue University. The flow controllers were assessed by their impact on the transition location and wave number of the largest-amplitude hot streaks. The transition location was accelerated by critical forcing (actuator wave number equals wave number of naturally largest-amplitude waves) and delayed by subcritical forcing (actuator wave number larger than natural waves). The disturbance wave number input of the plasma actuators was observed downstream on the model for many of the plasma-on runs, demonstrating that the plasma actuators introduced discrete forcing into the flow. The precise locations of the hot streaks arising from stationary crossflow vortices varied for different nosetips, presumably due to differences in their microscale roughness.",58,5

This study investigates oblique shock–boundary-layer interactions on a steady flexible panel in a Mach 2.0 flow. Experiments were performed in the Imperial College supersonic wind tunnel, where shock generators were used to produce an oblique shock followed by a corner expansion. A parametric study was conducted, exploring different shock impingement positions and shock–expansion distances. The steady aerostructural response is studied using schlieren photography, static pressure distributions, photogrammetry measurements, and surface oil flow visualization. Two-dimensional numerical simulations were performed to assess the effects of the flexible panel on downstream total pressure recovery. These were validated against experimental wall pressure distributions and measurements from a Pitot rake. Results show reductions in both separation length (of up to 40%) and stagnation pressure losses (of up to 10%) if the flexible plate is used. These improvements occur for a range of shock positions spanning approximately 50% of the panel length and for all the shock–expansion distances considered. A model that captures the flow physics responsible for these trends is proposed. The results highlight the potential of flexible panels for practical oblique shock control.",58,5

The objective of this study is to identify the origin of the low-frequency shock oscillations (LFO) and the associated side-loads generation in planar nozzles. The computational results are compared with the experimental data for validation. The promise of the near-wall LES modeling approach, adopted in this study, is supported by its satisfactory performance in correctly predicting the shock-induced flow separation and offering a major advantage of being 30–40 times faster than the wall-resolved LES counterpart, allowing thereby the capture of very–low-frequency shock oscillations with much better statistics convergence. The simulations bring clear evidence of the existence of broadband and energetically significant LFO in the vicinity of the separated shock, whose forward and backward movements are mainly driven by changes in the downstream flow conditions. The complex interactions between the backflow, the separation bubbles, and the large-scale turbulent structures developing in the shear-layer region strongly influence the shock unsteadiness, which in turn drives the LFO. A scenario of the LFO, confirming conclusions from earlier studies, is described in this work.",58,5

However, it is known that the original cone-derived waverider is longitudinally unstable. To solve the problem, a design method for hypersonic quasi-waverider configuration is first proposed and then a genetic algorithm optimization framework is constructed to obtain optimum quasi-waveriders with different constraints. During the optimization, the aerodynamic performance is evaluated by an efficient aerodynamic model that considers the impacts of strong viscous interaction effects. Results from numerical simulations show that, for the optimum quasi-waveriders without constraints, good shock wave attachment along the leading edge is achieved, and the maximum lift-to-drag ratio is even higher than that of the original waverider. Optimized quasi-waveriders are also generated based on the constraints of volumetric efficiency and stability. The first increases and then decreases with the increase in volumetric efficiency.

The model is based on superposition of the dimensionless mean continuum velocity and the dimensionless average slip velocity. The characteristic length used in the Poiseuille and Knudsen numbers is the hydraulic diameter. A novel slip flow parameter is introduced to account for the relationship between the average slip velocity and the average wall shear stress. The novel slip flow parameter lies in the range 0.5–0.6 for equilateral triangular microducts to very narrow rectangular microchannels when the characteristic length is the hydraulic diameter.

In this paper, based on the theoretical modeling method, a specific analogy of their effects on nonequilibrium stagnation flow is proposed. Therefore, the physical models and mathematical techniques employed in our previous studies on the chemical nonequilibrium flows can be extended to study the vibrational nonequilibrium effects that are dominant in the relatively lower-temperature flows. This analogy study introduces several nonequilibrium flow criteria and a formula that can be used to assess the vibrational nonequilibrium effects on stagnation point heat transfer to wall surfaces with an incomplete accommodation of the vibrational energy.

22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058533,"This paper presents a numerical investigation of mixing in supersonic flows using the hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation. Three configurations are comparatively studied to investigate the effects of confinement and heat release on the mixing: a nonreacting case without confinement, a nonreacting case with confinement, and a reacting case with confinement. First, the mixing region area is quantified and its development is characterized. Subsequently, the deformation and rotation of fluid are analyzed to illustrate the impacts of shocks and combustion on the mixing region development. The transport of vorticity is further discussed to explore the driving mechanism of mixing in different cases. The results show that the impingement of oblique shocks on the mixing region reduces its area due to compression but enhances the subsequent mixing by promoting vorticity via the dilatation and baroclinic torque effects. This leads to a wavelike pattern for the development of the mixing region. Heat release expands the mixing region and decreases vorticity in the upstream, where high heat-release rates are observed. Downstream, combustion products mix with air, and only weak heat release takes place. In that region, the baroclinic torque effect becomes dominant and results in higher vorticity as compared to the nonreacting case.",58,5

An inlet-fueled scramjet engine was designed with a symmetrical intake to reproduce the correct flow structures. This was tested with an inflow condition of Mach 7, using a Mach-10 flow enthalpy of to reproduce the combustion conditions in a flight vehicle operating at Mach 10. The turbulent flame was directly observed in the flow using planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH radicals. These results have been complemented by large-eddy simulations of the experimental conditions, showing that the combustion process in scramjets is multimode, where neither premixed nor non-premixed combustion dominates, and both substantially contribute to heat release. These modes are present simultaneously inside the engine. For both modes, combustion is confirmed to happen over multiple combustion regimes.

A two-dimensional planar inlet featuring a double-compression ramp with 10 and 22° inclination to the freestream direction and a rectangular-cross-section duct is tested. A solenoid is used to raise a barrier into the flow and initiate buzz at high throttling ratios. Static pressure is measured at a data sample rate of 10 kHz, and schlieren images are collected at an image frame rate of 30 kHz. Oscillations in the flow not linked to buzz are present at both zero and full throttle, and they cause a high-amplitude pressure peak at very high frequency (higher than 3 kHz). At full throttle, buzz is spotted, in the contemporary presence of shear layers being ingested by the intake (Ferri criterion) and of separated flow lying on the second compression ramp (Dailey criterion). Both features are analyzed by means of the standard deviation of the frames captured. The kind of buzz hereby observed activates high-amplitude pressure oscillations at both low frequencies and high frequencies. The unstarted flowfield is largely subsonic inside the intake and allows for the use of the linear acoustic theory. Indeed, one of the peaks recorded matches the quarter-wave resonator frequency (1411 Hz) of the inlet, suggesting that the barrier acts as a solid wall and that the inlet model behaves as a duct with a closed end.",58,5

(“Koopman-Based Approach to Nonintrusive Projection-Based Reduced-Order Modeling with Black-Box High-Fidelity Models,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 56, No. 10, 2018, pp. 4087–4111) is further extended toward parametric systems with a focus on application to aerospace design. Specifically, the method is extended to address static systems with parametric geometry (that deforms the mesh) in addition to parametric freestream boundary conditions. The main idea is to first perform a transformation on the governing equations such that it is lifted to a higher-dimensional but linear underdetermined system. This enables one to extract the system matrices easily as compared to that of the original nonlinear system. The underdetermined system is closed with a set of model-dependent nonlinear constraints upon which the model reduction is finally performed. The methodology is validated on the subsonic and transonic inviscid flows past the NACA0012 and the RAE2822 airfoils with parametrized shapes. The utility of the approach is further demonstrated by applying it to two common problems in aerospace design, namely, derivative-free global optimization and parametric uncertainty quantification with Monte Carlo sampling. Overall, the methodology is shown to achieve accuracy up to 5% and computational speedup of two to three orders of magnitude relative to the full order model. Comparison against another nonintrusive model reduction method revealed that the proposed approach is more robust, accurate, and retains the consistency between the state variables.",58,5

This paper approaches the problem of discrepancy prediction in coupled multiple models (especially multidisciplinary models) using Bayesian state estimation methods. The proposed state-estimation-based approach is found to have significant advantages over the previously studied Kennedy–O’Hagan method, in the estimation of discrepancies of hidden states, and in the identification of the sources of these discrepancies, namely, model form errors.

The proposed method employs two technical processes: the consolidation of multiple low-fidelity models and the refined adaptation of the consolidated model. Along with the resulting prediction model, the proposed method also provides model dominance information that can be used to understand the characteristic response of the high-fidelity model regarding essential behavior described by the low-fidelity models. Nondeterministic kriging is employed for variable-fidelity modeling under uncertainty. The performance and characteristics of the proposed method are demonstrated and discussed with multiple fundamental mathematical examples and a thermally coupled aircraft structural design problem.

This leads to occurrence of the Dirac’s delta function and its derivatives when substituting the flexural rigidity into the governing differential equation.",58,5
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058722,"Modal approaches are often preferred to the wave-based ones for the evaluation of instability conditions in classical nonlifting aeroelasticity of plates and shells. Here, within a wave-based finite element framework, sub- and supersonic aerodynamic models are introduced to analyze the effect of self-excited aerodynamic loading terms on the dispersive characteristics of structural waves. The method is validated by using a specific literature test case and is applicable on both isotropic and multilayered flat and curved structures. The sound transmission is also computed under sub- and supersonic turbulent boundary-layer excitations: the effect of including or neglecting the aeroelastic coupling is discussed.",58,5
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058441,"The increasing reliance of aerospace structures on numerical analyses encourages the development of accurate, yet computationally efficient, models. Finite element (FE) beam models have, in particular, become widely used approximations during preliminary design stages and to investigate novel concepts, for example, aeroelastic tailoring. Over the last 50 years, developments in hp-FE methods based on elements of variable size (h) and polynomial degree (p) have helped reduce the computational cost of numerical analyses. Concurrently, many structures, including aircraft wings and wind turbine blades, have gradually increased in length, slenderness, and complexity. As a result, modern blades and wings regularly operate beyond the range of linear deformation, requiring nonlinear analyses for which hp-FE methods are often not readily applicable. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to derive a corotational FE formulation for enriched three-, four-, and five-noded beam elements, suitable for nonlinear hp-FE refinement. To this end, the mathematical formulation is derived to incorporate enriched elements within the corotational FE beam framework. The proposed formulation is then validated against multiple nonlinear benchmark problems and an experimental case study.",58,5
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058669,"Investigated and revealed are new insights into the individual, decoupled effects of induced camber and spanwise bending on the lift, drag, and endurance for an optimum flexibility membrane-and-frame wing at Reynolds number 80,000. While previous studies into thin, flexible-wing designs for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles have been shown to improve aerodynamic performance and delay the onset of stall, the individual contributions of localized induced camber and spanwise bending on the performance improvement have not been sufficiently examined. Furthermore, since the locally induced camber and spanwise bending generally occur simultaneously, their decoupled effects are not well understood. This Paper first introduces a wing frame optimization approach using a rapid fluid/structure interaction model to identify a wing flexibility design that maximizes aerodynamic endurance. A higher-fidelity, large-eddy simulation is then used for validation of the optimized wing flexibility and to help explain both the coupled and uncoupled effects of the induced camber and spanwise bending that contribute to maximum performance. The formation of several locally induced cambers at specific planform regions is found to create greater endurance (minimum power required) through favorable lift generation, in addition to reduced drag at relatively high angles of attack. Spanwise bending, however, is observed to be a noncontributing byproduct of the increased thin-wing flexibility. Detailed pressure distributions and instantaneous flow structure visualizations from large-eddy simulation provide new insights into the individual contributions of induced camber and spanwise bending while also justifying the optimum wing design.",58,5
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058962,"The effect of stochastic variation in material and geometric properties on structural performance is important for robust design. Knowledge of such effects can be acquired by applying variation patterns to a structure using random fields through a Monte Carlo analysis. The output is postprocessed to show the correlation pattern between the stochastic variation of a structural property and a chosen mechanical response measure. The resulting patterns are used to identify areas most susceptible to variations, as well as areas that have the most potential to increase structural performance by varying the material parameter or geometry. By using these maps of local sensitivity to variations with respect to the structural response, it is possible to redistribute material properties or geometry to promote certain behavior. This is demonstrated on a flat plate and curved panel by varying either the Young’s modulus or the thickness of the structure to increase the linear buckling load. In both of these variations the average property is set to remain the same as the original structure. Applying the redistribution increased the linear buckling load by up to 29%.",58,5
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J059109,"Tensegrities have found many technologically important applications in architecture, aerospace, biological engineering, and soft robotics. Loss of members in tensegrity structures may have an important effect on their nonlinear behaviors. In this paper, the effect of the rupture of cables on two periodic tensegrity grids (with and without clustered cables) is investigated by using the corotational approach. A tangent stiffness matrix is derived for a clustered cable running through pulleys. The rupture of cables is modeled by considering the elastoplastic deformation. The proposed finite element formulation is validated by a simple example and then applied into the analysis of complex tensegrity grids. The propagation of slack and the rupture of cables are discussed in detail. The results of the numerical simulation show that clustered cables play important roles in sharing external loads such that the clustered tensegrity grid has a uniform deformation in comparison with the classical one. On the other hand, interestingly, a global deformation resilience induced by local mechanism modes is observed for the classical tensegrity grid. The finding may be valuable for designs of tensegrity-based metamaterials and energy harvesting devices. The work provides an efficient and numerical way of nonlinear analysis of both classical and clustered tensegrities.",58,5
35,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058243,"The coupled equations of motion of an unrestrained flexible body when derived using multibody dynamics or mean axes formulation consist of three mass coupling integrals, namely, the first-order and second-order inertia effects as well as the second-order momentum-coupling vectors. The computation of these coupling integrals requires access to a finite element formulation [source code that uses shape functions to generate the finite element method (FEM) model], which is often unavailable. This work, using modal superposition, presents a mathematical formulation that allows computation of these integrals for a given finite element model (FEM model) of an unrestrained deformable vehicle nonintrusively: that is, without access to the actual finite element source code. It shows that the required integrals can be computed if one can access the consistent mass matrix of the vehicle from the FEM model. The formulation has been verified with an example of an unrestrained crossbeam model using Rayleigh–Ritz and the finite element method for computing the coupling integrals. In the Rayleigh–Ritz method, the coupling integrals are computed using the integral equations; in the FEM, they are computed using the consistent mass matrix. The use of a consistent mass matrix to compute the integrals agrees well with those obtained using volumetric integration in the Rayleigh–Ritz method. Finally, these integrals were calculated for two flexible unmanned-aerial–vehicle-type aircraft: mAEWing1 and mAEWing2. The results help in determination of the significance of these terms in flight dynamics.",58,5
