1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051597,"The combined approximations method proposed by Kirsch is an efficient reanalysis method providing high-quality results. To integrate the Kirsch method into a structural optimization process, this paper presents a new adaptive Kirsch method to determine the minimum number of basis vectors using the -condition number. Consequently, a closer relationship between the Kirsch method and structural optimization is bridged. Moreover, the effectiveness of the Kirsch method is improved for application in optimal design problems. The presented numerical results prove that the adaptive Kirsch method is significantly more efficient than the Kirsch method because of the advantage of adaptively determining the minimum number of basis vectors to satisfy the predefined reanalysis error.",52,3
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052023,"Aerospace engineers and analysts tasked with informing system-level decisions commonly seek to identify the frontier of Pareto-optimal solutions with respect to objectives of interest. For problems in which decisions are made over multiple stages or periods, dynamic programming can be an efficient and effective method for identifying such a Pareto frontier. To employ traditional dynamic programming, however, a single objective function must be defined. Aggregation of multiple objectives into a single objective using traditional simple additive weighting has the limitation of permitting identification of only points on convex portions of the Pareto frontier. This can translate into detection of a frontier with significant and misleading gaps. This paper proposes a theory-motivated aggregation function modification and method to improve the ability of dynamic programming procedures to detect concave portions of Pareto frontiers in multi-objective, multistage problems. Following a theoretical motivation and method definition, a military aircraft route planning example is provided to illustrate the method’s accuracy and efficiency.",52,3
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052127,"Tension-aligned structures have been proposed for space-based antenna applications that require a high degree of accuracy. The structure uses a compression member to impart tension on the antenna, thus helping to maintain shape and facilitate disturbance rejection. These structures can be very large and therefore sensitive to low-frequency excitation. A simple control strategy for tension-aligned structures is proposed, based on the concept of stiffness variation by sequential application and removal of constraints. The process funnels vibration energy from low-frequency to high-frequency modes of the structure, where it is dissipated naturally due to internal damping. A simple model for the arrangement is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control strategy. It consists of a curved beam modeled as a nonlinear elastica arch (the support structure), connected to an array of hinged panels (the antenna). Two methods for stiffness switching are investigated: variable stiffness hinges in the panels and variable stiffness elastic bars connecting the panels to the structure. It is shown in simulations that sequential application and removal of the constraints is an effective mechanism to remove energy from the system. Variable stiffness hinges are effective in low-tension applications, while combining hinges with elastic bars is required in the presence of high-tension loads.",52,3
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052236,"Two semi-implicit six-stage Runge–Kutta algorithms are developed for the simulation of wall-bounded flows. Using these schemes, time integration is implicit in the wall-normal direction, and explicit in the other directions, to relax the time step constraint due to the fine mesh near the wall. The explicit subscheme is a six-stage fourth-order low-storage Runge–Kutta scheme. Based on analysis in Fourier space and results obtained for propagation test cases, the semi-implicit schemes are shown to be of order 3 and, for waves discretized by a number of points per period between 4 and 16, to be as accurate as, or more accurate than, the standard explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm in terms of dissipation and dispersion. The large-eddy simulation of a compressible turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of 360 and a Mach number of 0.1 is then carried out with one of the proposed algorithms. The computational time is reduced by a factor 1.33 with respect to a large-eddy simulation using the explicit subscheme in all directions. Wall-pressure and velocity spectra from the large-eddy simulation are presented to give insights into the flow turbulent structures. In particular, wave number–frequency spectra are calculated. Acoustic components appear to be identified in these spectra.",52,3
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052316,"This paper investigates the linearization, using perturbation methods, of the structural deformations in the nonlinear flight dynamic response of aircraft with slender, flexible wings. The starting point is the coupling of a displacement-based geometrically nonlinear flexible-body dynamics formulation with a three-dimensional unsteady vortex lattice method. This is followed by a linearization of the structural degrees of freedom, which are assumed to be small in a body-fixed reference frame. The translations and rotations of that reference frame and their time derivatives, which describe the vehicle flight dynamics, can still be arbitrarily large. The resulting system preserves all couplings between rigid and elastic motions and can be projected onto a few vibration modes of the unconstrained aircraft with geometrically nonlinear static deflections at a trim condition. Equally, the unsteady aerodynamics can be approximated on a fixed lattice defined by the deformed static geometry. Numerical studies on a representative high-altitude long-endurance aircraft are presented to illustrate the approach. The results show an improvement compared to those obtained using the mean-axes approximation.",52,3
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052348,"Large-eddy simulation of a normal shock train in a constant-area isolator model (, ) is carried out to investigate solution sensitivity with respect to a variety of physical modeling assumptions. Simulations with spanwise periodic boundary conditions are first performed, the results of which are compared with experiment and validated with a three-level grid refinement study. Due to the computational cost associated with resolving near-wall structures, the large-eddy simulation is run at a Reynolds number lower than that in the comparison experiment; thus, the confinement effect of the turbulent boundary layers is not exactly duplicated. Although this discrepancy is found to affect the location of the first normal shock, the overall structure of the shock train and its interaction with the boundary layers matches the experiment quite closely. Observations of pertinent physical phenomena in the experiment, such as a lack of reversed flow in the mean and the development of secondary shear layers, are confirmed by the simulation. Next, three-dimensional effects due to the side walls of the isolator are investigated by performing large-eddy simulation of the same shock train interaction in a three-dimensional, low-aspect-ratio rectangular duct geometry. It is observed that the same pressure ratio that results in a stable shock train with periodic boundary conditions may result in isolator unstart when side-wall effects are fully resolved, further emphasizing the profound role of geometry and boundary-layer confinement on the dynamics of the shock train system. Additionally, it is found that measures of local flow blockage, such as the ratio of boundary-layer thickness to duct height, are more important than total pressure loss in locating the initial shock within an isolator.",52,3
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052493,"The mixing processes in an accelerated duct flow from subsonic to supersonic flow speed with blunt-body wakes were investigated experimentally. Four different injectors, all with their trailing edges located in the subsonic part of the flow and designed as wing bodies, were compared. A toluene/nitrogen mixture was added into the flow through the injectors, and the flow structures behind the injector trailing edges were visualized applying laser-induced fluorescence imaging. The injector flow was parallel to the duct flow and at angles of 45 deg and 90 deg to the ambient air flow. Furthermore, one injector was designed with ramps on the upper and lower surface. Instantaneous images showed that the mixing process was dominated by separated shear layers behind the injectors, which rolled up to vortices being shed from the blunt trailing edge. The injector flow spread out more with increasing injection angle and the edges of the vortices were frayed. In the case of the ramp injector, additional streamwise vortices were generated, and thus the mixing took place in the core region of the flow for a longer distance. Scaling properties such as the half-width, the gradient of the growing wake, and the virtual origin were calculated. This showed that the half-width of the intensity profiles followed the -power-law. Furthermore, the intensity at the duct centerline decreased asymptotically, and the wake showed a self-preserving state.",52,3
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052496,"A homogenized modeling technique is developed in this paper to account for viscous damping properties in beam-like lattice structures of repeated patterns. Necessary assumptions regarding the local free deformations, shear deformation beam theory, and compatibility conditions are made to obtain an equivalent continuum model of a three-dimensional lattice. A dissipated energy equivalence approach is then used to relate the energy dissipation for a general case of damping matrix in a lattice element to an equivalent proportionally damped model. As a result, a continuum model with Kelvin–Voigt damping is obtained. Damped bending natural frequencies, frequency response functions, and damping ratios are found using this method and compared to the results of a finite-element analysis for several structures for the purpose of validation.",52,3
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052470,"A numerical study of two microramp geometries has been conducted to study their effectiveness in controlling swept shock wave–boundary-layer interactions. The planar shock wave is generated by placing a 20 deg sharp fin in a supersonic flow at Mach 4. The heights of microramps were varied as 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 90% of the boundary-layer thickness. The effect of microramp width and spacing is also studied. It is observed that boundary-layer separation is delayed significantly, downstream of the devices. Further, larger ramp heights were found to be more beneficial in delaying the separation.",52,3
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052514,"A new rotational energy exchange model for direct simulation Monte Carlo and multi-temperature Navier–Stokes methods is presented. The direct simulation Monte Carlo model is based only on collision quantities and reduces to a rotational collision number in the continuum limit, applicable for use with the Jeans relaxation equation. The model is formulated based on recent molecular dynamics simulations of rotational relaxation in nitrogen (Valentini et al., Physics of Fluids, Vol. 24, No. 10, 2012, p. 106101) and accounts for the dependence of the relaxation rate on the direction to the equilibrium state. This enables a single parameterization of the model to accurately simulate rotational relaxation in both compressing and expanding flows, unlike the widely used Parker model. The direct simulation Monte Carlo model is simple to implement, numerically efficient, and accurately reproduces a range of pure molecular dynamics solutions, including isothermal relaxations, normal shock waves, and expansions. A general form for the energy distribution function that should be sampled for post-collision states (using the Borgnakke–Larsen approach) is presented. This general formulation ensures detailed balance and equipartition of energy at equilibrium for any collision-quantity-based direct simulation Monte Carlo model and also explains the behavior of prior rotational models in the literature. The model formulation is also general to the inelastic collision selection procedure used, which is shown to be a crucial aspect in implementing a direct simulation Monte Carlo collision model. Finally, the increased accuracy of a collision-quantity-based model compared with a cell-averaged model is demonstrated by comparing rotational energy distribution functions within a shock wave against pure molecular dynamics solutions.",52,3
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052526,"In this paper, a hybrid control method for partially liquid-filled spacecraft maneuvers is proposed. This control scheme integrates the command input shaping technique and the feedback linearization method to guarantee the implementation of the maneuver task for spacecraft to yield the desirable suppression of liquid fuel slosh. The coupled slosh spacecraft in attitude maneuver carrying a sloshing liquid is considered as a multibody system with the sloshing motion modeled as a spherical pendulum. Nonlinearly coupled equations of attitude and orbital motion are presented for the partially liquid-filled spacecraft undergoing fuel slosh. A feedback linearization approach is applied to transform the nonlinear system dynamics into a linear system (inverse dynamics of the original system or so-called dynamics inversion) to compute the input corresponding to the reference output. Dynamic inversion and input shaping techniques are used to design a controller for the reference tacking maneuver of spacecraft with fuel sloshing. Numerical simulation results are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control method.",52,3
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052554,"A general formulation of the flutter equation includes gyroscopics, viscous damping, active controls, Mach and complex reduced-frequency-based unsteady aerodynamics, quasi-linear approximated structural nonlinearities, and parameterized matrices. Solving the flutter equation usually involves a search for neutral stability points, the boundary between stability and instability, followed by variations in the neutral stability point with various parameters. A technique for solving the flutter equation under these conditions must necessarily be capable of solving systems of nonlinear parameterized equations over a range of parameter values. Continuation methods are specifically designed for solving such problems. A continuation method is presented that is capable of solving general formulations of the flutter equation for neutral stability, parameter variations, optimization, model tuning, and describing function flutter analyses, including an efficient technique for assessing limit cycle stability.",52,3
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052561,"Rough walls can produce noise through local effects such as vortex shedding or through diffraction of the convected turbulent flowfield. It is known that diffraction dominates for hydrodynamically smooth surfaces and self-noise dominates for obstructions many times the size of the boundary layer, but as of yet, the transition between regimes has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, the limits of acoustic diffraction theory for rough wall flows are examined by analyzing the unsteady drag inferred from measurement of the far-field noise produced by fetches of discrete roughness elements ranging in size from to 6% and from 14 to 18%. Measured unsteady drag spectra are compared to theoretically predicted spectra from diffraction theory. It is shown that the effectiveness of diffraction theory is not solely dependent on the relative turbulence and roughness scales, but on the ratio of roughness height to boundary-layer thickness as well. It is also shown that the unsteady drag spectra produced by differing roughness geometries and velocities produce tighter collapse at nondimensional frequencies less than one. At higher nondimensional frequencies, the spectra fan out by roughness type and velocity, but this effect is captured by diffraction theory, which works well into the frequencies at which the scale of the dominant turbulent eddies along the convective ridge of the wave-number-frequency wall-pressure spectrum are smaller than the roughness elements.",52,3
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052510,"An in-house discrete vortex method code based on steady and unsteady thin airfoil theory is used to rapidly resolve the flowfield and force coefficients for low Reynolds number unsteady aerodynamic applications. The Uhlman method is incorporated due to its ability to incorporate vortex motion, and surface effects in the volume and surface integrals make it ideal to calculate the pressure and the associated forces on the airfoil surface. The code is then used to study both low and high angle of attack impulsive motions, the AIAA Fluid Dynamics Technical Committee Low Reynolds Number Working Group 0–45 deg Pitch–Ramp–Hold Canonical cases, a similar 0–85 deg Pitch–Ramp–Hold to closer simulate perching, a 0–40–0 deg Pitch–Ramp–Hold–Return, and high reduced frequency pure plunge. In all cases, the flowfield and accompanying lift-and-drag results compared well with experimental and computational fluid dymanics results given the extent of the assumptions underlying the discrete vortex method.",52,3
