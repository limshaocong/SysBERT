Four jets are underexpanded and four jets are ideally expanded, which allowed examination of the influence of the presence of shock-cell structures. The underexpanded jets are characterized by a fully expanded Mach number of 1.56 and an exit Mach number of 1. The ideally expanded jets have a Mach number of 1.5. The Reynolds number of the eight jets is equal to . The jets impinge normally on a flat plate located from to downstream of the nozzle and generate acoustic tones due to an aeroacoustic feedback mechanism. In this paper, the near pressure and density fields of the jets are characterized using Fourier transform on the nozzle exit plane, the plate, and an azimuthal plane. First, mean and rms radial velocities of the wall jets are examined. The impact of the shock-cell structure on the wall jet is discussed. The pressure spectra on the plate are then shown as a function of the radial coordinate. The tone frequencies are all visible where the jet shear layers impinge the plate, but only some of them emerge in the wall jet created after the impact. For the ideally expanded jets, the temporal organization of the wall jet along the frequencies of the feedback mechanism decreases with the nozzle-to-plate distance, but for the nonideally expanded jets, this organization is linked to the oscillation of the Mach disk located just upstream of the plate. Consecutively, the amplitude and the phase fields at the tone frequencies are represented on the three planes mentioned earlier. Similar spatial organizations of the turbulent structures are found in the jet shear layers and in the wall jets. Thus, axisymmetric and helical arrangements of the structures in the jet shear layers lead to concentric and spiral distributions of the structures on the plate, respectively. In particular, for one of the underexpanded jets, a spiral shape and concentric rings, associated with two tone frequencies generated simultaneously, are observed on the flat plate in the pressure and density phase fields. Finally, the convection velocity of the turbulent structures at the tone frequencies in the wall jets are evaluated based on phase fields, and the mean convection velocity is computed using cross correlations of radial velocity. The results are in good agreement with those from a recent experimental study of ideally expanded impinging jets.",56,2
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056181,"A simple model of the flowfield induced by an inclined jet into an incompressible crossflow is proposed. In general, such a jet generates an asymmetric pair of vortices, with a larger one farther from the wall. The model accounts for the influence of the jet pitch angle (with respect to the wall), skew angle (with respect to the freestream direction), and velocity ratio (the jet velocity to the freestream velocity) on the jet trajectory in the transverse plane in the far field. From the model, the increase of the jet penetration and the circulation of the large vortex in the transverse plane to the downstream distance obeys to the same one-third law in the case of normal transverse jet. Data from the literature are normalized and compared to the model. Although there is considerable scatter, the normalized data are generally in accord with the predictions of the model. However, for low velocity ratios when skew angle is near 90 deg, the effect of jet entrainment, and the effect of the horseshoe and wake vortices, may create a low-pressure region on the wall and hence alter the jet trajectory and influence the circulation.",56,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056251,"Non-reactive large-eddy simulations (LES) of a hydrogen jet injected into a transverse supersonic flow of vitiated air at Mach 2 are conducted. The present investigation is focused on the intertwinement of first- and second-order subgrid-scale (SGS) moments, such as the filtered value of a normalized reference scalar and its associated SGS variance level. Such a reference scalar is often settled to follow the mixing between the jet of hydrogen and the vitiated airflow. The discussion covers the influence of numerical errors, including commutation and discretization errors, as well as the possible effects of the closures retained to represent the unresolved SGS scalar dynamics. The sensitivity of the SGS scalar description, on the former, i.e., numerical errors, is enlightened with a special focus placed on the SGS variance evaluation, which is of practical importance for applications to turbulent reactive flow simulations. The SGS scalar variance is presently calculated by using three distinct procedures, which are at least formally, i.e., mathematically, equivalent. However, the results obtained by using the various procedures display some remarkable differences, which are the subject of the present analysis and discussion. It is finally demonstrated that the different results can be reconcilied together. The present results may thus provide some useful guidance for SGS variance estimation in the context of LES of turbulent scalar mixing and combustion.",56,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055877,"Many simulation tools for airfoil analysis and design are based on an integral approximation of the boundary layer. This approximate formulation cannot resolve the full dynamics of boundary-layer flows and hence requires additional models to account for unresolved effects. This paper introduces a new, data-driven, probabilistic model of these unresolved effects for the incompressible and laminar regime. To construct this model, methods from supervised learning have been applied to a dataset containing over 1550 airfoils. The result is a model that 1) is based on a large dataset of realistic airfoil configurations, and 2) quantifies the model inadequacy associated with the use of an approximate boundary-layer formulation. A stochastic version of the airfoil design tool XFOIL has also been created by replacing its original boundary-layer model with the probabilistic model developed here. This stochastic version of XFOIL has been applied to compute the drag polars of two airfoils at low Reynolds numbers and the results are compared with experimental data.",56,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056267,"A swept flat plate model with an imposed pressure gradient was experimentally investigated in a low-speed flow to determine the effect of a backward-facing step on transition in a stationary crossflow–dominated flow. Detailed hotwire measurements of boundary-layer flow were performed to investigate the upstream shift in transition due to a step height of 49% of the local unperturbed boundary-layer thickness. Increasing the initial stationary crossflow amplitude caused an upstream movement of the transition front for the backward-facing step case. The step caused a local increase in the growth of the stationary crossflow instabilities, but the stationary crossflow amplitude at transition was sufficiently low so that stationary crossflow was not solely responsible for transition. The unsteady velocity spectra downstream of the step were rich with unsteady disturbances in the 80- to 1500-Hz range. Three distinct families of disturbances were identified based on phase speed and wave angle, namely, a highly oblique disturbance (possibly traveling-crossflow-like), a Tollmien–Schlichting-wave-like disturbance, and a shear-layer instability. The stationary crossflow disturbances caused a modulation of the unsteady disturbances, resulting in spatially concentrated peaks in unsteady disturbance amplitude. This modulation of the unsteady disturbances is believed to be the reason for the upstream movement of the transition front with increasing stationary crossflow amplitude.",56,2

The freestream disturbances are generated from a wavy wall placed at the nozzle wall. The freestream acoustic disturbances radiated by the wavy wall are obtained by solving the linearized Euler equations. The results show that no noticeable instability modes are generated when the acoustic disturbances impinge the cone obliquely. The results show that the perturbations generated inside the boundary layer by the acoustic disturbances are the response of the boundary layer to the external forcing. The amplitude of the forced disturbances inside the boundary layer are about 2.5 times larger than the incoming field for zero azimuthal wave number, and they are about 1.5 times for large azimuthal wave numbers.",56,2

Validation of the numerical methods is presented and the results are compared. A new comparison between solutions to the triple-deck equations and the compressible Navier–Stokes equations is presented. It was found that the triple-deck trends qualitatively match the trends produced by numerical solutions to the compressible Navier–Stokes equations.

7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056107,"The mechanism of oblique shock wave control by surface arc discharge plasma is explored through a combined numerical and experimental study. The experiments are conducted in a supersonic wind tunnel with Mach number of 2.5, total pressure of 3.5–6.4 bar, and total temperature of 300 K. An oblique shock is formed by a compression ramp with an angle of 7 deg mounted on the lower wall of the wind tunnel. Six electrodes are arranged equally in the spanwise direction and upstream of the compression ramp. The schlieren images show that the angle of the original oblique shock is increased, and the surface pressure measurements indicate that the oblique shock is weakened by the addition of the stable discharge arc. The reason is that the arc heating decreases the Mach number upstream of the oblique shock; thus, the oblique shock is weakened and the shock angle is increased. A three-dimensional numerical simulation is performed using experimental configuration. Results show that the static pressure increases in front of the oblique shock and decreases after the shock, which is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. This validates that the numerical model presents a reasonable approach for the arc discharge plasma and further confirms the predominant role of the thermal effects of plasma on shock manipulation.",56,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056190,"An experimental study was conducted to examine the effects of repetitive energy deposition on the supersonic flow characteristics over a duct system with a central conical compression surface. Boundary-layer separation on the compression surface could induce flow instability in pulsation and resonant modes. At subcritical operation, this flow instability became stronger and the “big buzz” phenomenon occurred. To control these undesirable operations, repetitive laser energy deposition was done with a repetition frequency of up to 60 kHz, which resulted in a reduction of flow separation on the compression surface. It was also observed that flow oscillation characteristics at the two modes were modified; total pressure inside the duct chamber was increased and the big buzz was significantly suppressed.",56,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056223,"Active circulation control on a thick blunt trailing edge wind turbine airfoil is proposed and numerically investigated by solving Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations along with Spalart–Allmaras one-equation turbulence model. The code is validated by comparing results with experiment based on the grid independency study. The circulation control greatly enhances the aerodynamic characteristics of the flatback airfoil by increasing the lift and simultaneously reducing the drag while using external energy. The drag can be reduced even to be negative due to combined contributions from the well-controlled wake separation and the jet reaction force. The two typical control regimes, namely, separation control and super-circulation control, are observed and analyzed. The enhancement in lift for both regimes can be further improved by increasing jet momentum coefficient or decreasing slot height, but at cost of higher external energy. Investigation shows that a great amount of net gain of energy can be obtained by implementing circulation control on the blunt trailing edge airfoil, and the circulation control with a relatively large slot height has a better control efficiency. It is demonstrated that the present proposed circulation control method is effective, efficient, and thus promising for the flow control in the blunt trailing edge wind turbine application.",56,2

Under the presented experimental circumstances, intermittent trailing-edge vortex shedding occurs. A flow diagnostic analysis combining the proper orthogonal decomposition method with a recurrence plot and quantification analysis reveals that the occurrence and duration of vortex-shedding interruptions are random and that the durations of the interruptions are shorter than the intervals of regular shedding. Furthermore, a recurrence-based conditional averaging strategy is proposed that preserves the instantaneous dynamics of the wake flow and allows for successful separation of the coherent and turbulent contributions to the flowfield fluctuations. Based on the recurrence-based conditional averaged flowfields, the spatiotemporal evolution of the wake centerline is visualized and the wake convection speed is calculated. The latter is found to be distributed normally around 0.66 of the freestream velocity. Classic vortex detection and tracking reveals a formation length of of the airfoil chord length downstream of the trailing edge before alternating trailing edge vortex shedding can occur through mutual interactions of the upper and lower shear layers.",56,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055488,"The purpose of this paper is to propose a generic analytical flapping-wing cycle-average thrust-force estimation method by implementing elongated body theory into actuator disk theory. Compared with previous a flapping-wing analysis based on actuator disk theory, the proposed method relates wing geometry and kinematics directly to induced velocity, and the periodical pressure pulsation correction factor measurement for every different flapping-wing design is no longer necessary. The proposed method is much simpler than unsteady aerodynamics or computational implementations, and thus the complex multiparameter optimization can be avoided at the early design stage of flapping-wing vehicles. Theoretical deviation of the proposed thrust model is evaluated by a numerical simulation method, and a correction term is proposed. The corrected method is then validated by wind-tunnel experiments on an 850-cm-wing-span active-twisting flapping-wing model and experimental data from previous studies that were over large parameter ranges. The results suggest that the proposed method is valid for the flapping-wing cycle-average thrust estimation over a large range of variables. Theoretical deductions about the effects of dominant factors of flapping-wing propulsion behavior and application of the present method in both passive- and active-twisting flapping-wing designs are also discussed.",56,2

This decomposition allows for a correct and straightforward computation of the dynamic force derivatives even in strongly nonlinear flows. Theory has been applied to numerical solutions around a pitching and plunging plate at low (300) and high Reynolds numbers. A breakdown between thrust and drag contributions is also obtained, evidencing the flow regions where the thrust force is generated. The obtained decomposition is compared with the classical analytical linear inviscid theories. In addition, a new mixed inertial–non-inertial formula is proposed for the computation of the aerodynamic force, which is more accurate when dealing with high Reynolds numbers flows.",56,2

Numerical flow simulations are performed for three different rotor/stator configurations and one rotational speed, representative of an approach operating condition, by using the lattice-Boltzmann solver PowerFLOW. The full stage and nacelle geometries are considered, and results are compared to available measurements. Tripping the rotor blades results in a slightly more accurate noise prediction as a consequence of a more accurate prediction of the velocity fluctuations in the rotor wake over the whole blade span. Fourier circumferential analyses are performed for an intake and a bypass duct section with the intent of explaining the origin of some tonal noise components and comparing the present results to available literature results. Finally, the effects of adding an acoustic treatment in the intake is shown by directly resolving the unsteady flowfield in a single-degree-of-freedom honeycomb layer.",56,2

The relative influence of the vortex tangential and axial velocity on the blade aerodynamics and on the acoustics radiated in the far field is analyzed by comparing the interaction with a Batchelor vortex to the interactions considering the vortex tangential or axial velocity components. Analyses show that the vortex tangential velocity contributes mostly to the noise level at low frequencies, whereas the vortex axial velocity is responsible for the contribution at high frequencies. For the range of frequencies in between, the interaction noise results from constructive interferences of the noise radiated separately by each velocity component of the vortex.",56,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056347,"This paper describes a new mode detection method based on the compressive sensing approach, which has been developed in information technology to reduce samples required by the classical Nyquist–Shannon sampling theory. A revised approach is proposed here to detect azimuthal spinning modes from aeroengine fan noise by using a microphone array outside the bypass duct. A number of numerical simulations is prepared to examine the associated test performance, such as the reconstruction accuracy, robustness, background noise interference, and coherence impact. The mode sparsity is usually much smaller than the highest order of the modes, so the azimuthal mode is sparse at the frequency of interest to ensure a satisfactory compressive sensing-based mode detection. The current simulations show log sensors shall be generally sufficient rather than sensors required by the Shannon–Nyquist sampling theory. An experimental system is designed and implemented to demonstrate the proposed method. The test system contains a straightened and rigid duct with an enclosed spinning mode synthesizer to emulate fan noise propagation inside and scattering from a bypass duct. An outer sensor array is employed to demonstrate that the compressive sensing-based mode detection method can significantly reduce the required number of sensors, especially for modes of high order, which results in a much simplified sensor array design for aerospace noise tests.",56,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055389,"Gradient-based sensitivity analysis has proven to be an enabling technology for many applications, including design of aerospace vehicles. However, conventional sensitivity analysis methods break down when applied to long-time averages of chaotic systems. This breakdown is a serious limitation because many aerospace applications involve physical phenomena that exhibit chaotic dynamics: most notably high-resolution large-eddy and direct numerical simulations of turbulent aerodynamic flows. A recently proposed methodology, called least-squares shadowing, avoids this breakdown and advances the state of the art in sensitivity analysis for chaotic flows. The first application of least-squares shadowing to a chaotic flow simulated with a large-scale computational fluid dynamics solver is presented. The least-squares shadowing sensitivity computed for this chaotic flow is verified and shown to be accurate, but the computational cost of the current least-squares shadowing implementation is high.",56,2

Autocorrelation analysis on temperature and wind speed variations from various meteorological datasets was implemented to evaluate turbulent scales for various atmospheric regions. Results indicated that the turbulent integral length scale was distributed approximately 11–13 m in the surface layer up to a height of 100 m and approximately 40 m in the whole troposphere region including the atmospheric boundary layer. Derived integral length scales were consistent with those found in previous studies, and the scales were successfully correlated with the root mean square velocity through a proposed scaling law using the energy dissipation rate.",56,2

In applications of these methods, modeled PDF transport equations are commonly simulated via classical Monte Carlo techniques, which provide estimates of moments of the PDF at arbitrary accuracy. In this work, recently developed techniques in quantum computing and quantum enhanced measurements (quantum metrology) are used to construct a quantum algorithm that accelerates the computation of such estimates. This quantum algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods in terms of the number of repetitions needed to achieve the desired precision. This paper illustrates the power of this algorithm by considering a binary scalar mixing process modeled by means of the coalescence/dispersion (C/D) closure. The equation is first simulated using classical Monte Carlo methods, where error estimates for the computation of central moments are provided. Then the quantum algorithm for this problem is simulated by sampling from the same probability distribution as that of the output of a quantum computer, and it is shown that significantly fewer resources are required to achieve the same precision.

The model solves a two-point boundary value problem for a coupled set of equations for the streamwise velocity and the turbulent viscosity. Since it includes both the pressure gradient and the momentum balance of the full Navier–Stokes system, the ordinary differential equation is valid farther from the wall. We implement the model within a Cartesian cut-cell method and use one-dimensional linelets in each cut cell to avoid the excessive mesh refinement that would otherwise be needed. The linelets are coupled to the outer Cartesian grid in a fully conservative manner, with two-way interaction between the linelets and the background grid. Detailed comparisons of velocity and eddy viscosity with three well-studied examples from the Turbulence Modeling Resource website are presented to demonstrate the model’s performance in two space dimensions, including an example with smooth-body separation.

21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056240,"Aerospace vehicles flying at supersonic and hypersonic speeds are subject to increased wall heating rates caused by viscous friction with the gas environment. This extra heat is commonly referred to as convective aerodynamic heating. In wall-modeled large-eddy simulations, the near-wall region of the flow is not resolved by the computational grid. As a result, the effects of aerodynamic heating need to be modeled using a large-eddy simulation wall model. In this investigation, wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of turbulent high-speed flows are performed to address this issue. In particular, an equilibrium wall model is employed in high-speed turbulent Couette flows subject to different combinations of thermal boundary conditions and grid sizes as well as in transitional hypersonic boundary layers interacting with incident shock waves. Specifically, the wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of the Couette flow configuration demonstrate that the shear-stress and heat-flux predictions made by the wall model show only a small sensitivity to the grid resolution even in the most adverse case where aerodynamic heating prevails near the wall and generates a sharp temperature peak there. Additionally, the simulations indicate that the wall model predicts shear stresses and heat fluxes that are mostly proportional to the near-wall velocity in a manner that resembles an approximate power law. In the wall-modeled large-eddy simulation of hypersonic boundary-layer/shock-wave interaction, the model is tested against direct numerical simulations and experiments. It is shown to correctly capture aerodynamic heating and the overall heat transfer rate around the shock-impingement zone, despite the fact that the adverse pressure gradients in that region may involve nonequilibrium effects.",56,2

The results were compared to the deterministic solution of the ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook model Boltzmann kinetic equation with the Runge–Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method. Numerical simulations using these methods were compared to the electron beam fluorescence experiments at a Reynolds number of 73 and a Mach number of 0.8.

Leveraging advantages in stiffness control over traditional fabrication techniques through multimaterial three-dimensional printing, the model demonstrated that conventional internal topologies can be achieved while still achieving a predictable flutter response within the limitations of a low-speed wind tunnel. A case study via aeroelastic analysis identified a valid half-span model design. Fabrication challenges including discontinuous stiffness requirements and part sizes larger than available printer build-tray dimensions were overcome via novel techniques that maintained the desired modal response. Specifically, repetitive interpenetrating fastening features eliminated the need for traditional fasteners and elastomeric breaks maintained a continuous aerodynamic surface despite discontinuous stiffness requirements.

28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056591,"Natural vibration characteristics of rotating blades are of fundamental importance from the viewpoint of maneuvering, blade life, vibration levels, aeroelastic, and stability. Helicopters may have serious resonant vibration problems when the excitation frequencies are equal to some multiple of the rotational speed. To ensure that conditions susceptible to resonance do not exist within the range of operating speeds, it is necessary that the natural frequencies and mode shapes be determined accurately. On one hand, as the complexity of multibody systems and the methods used for their design and control increases, the need for more elegant formulations of the equations of motion becomes an issue of paramount importance. On the other hand, although processor speed has increased dramatically over the last decade, development of computationally efficient algorithms is still a major issue in multibody dynamics. The transfer matrix method for multibody systems (MSTMM) accounts for both aspects. Based on many advantages of MSTMM in studying multibody system dynamics, a scenario of dynamics coupling between the flexible twin blade rotor and flexible fuselage of a typical helicopter model is proposed. The dynamical model of the coupled system, its topological figure, the overall transfer equation, and the characteristics equation are developed.

Existing approaches for optimization under these types of uncertainty mostly rely on treating combinations of statistical moments as separate objectives, but this can give rise to stochastically dominated designs. Here, horsetail matching is extended for use with these types of uncertainties to overcome some of the limitations of existing approaches. The formulation delivers a single, differentiable metric as the objective function for optimization. It is demonstrated on algebraic test problems, the design of a wing using a low-fidelity coupled aerostructural code, and the aerodynamic shape optimization of a wing using computational fluid dynamics analysis.",56,2
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054779,"This paper presents a novel gradient-free trust region assisted adaptive response surface method for aircraft optimization problems with expensive functions. A gradient-free trust region sampling space approach is developed for design space reduction and sequential sampling, and response surface metamodel refitting enables the trust region assisted adaptive response surface method to possess higher optimization efficiency and better global convergence capability. Besides, an election sequential Latin hypercube sampling method is developed to improve the space-filling property and feasibility of the sequential samples. Moreover, the augmented Lagrangian method is employed to handle expensive constraints. The trust region assisted adaptive response surface method outperforms several adaptive response surface metamodel variants in the comparative study on a number of benchmark problems. Additionally, compared with several other well-known metamodel-based global optimization algorithms, the proposed algorithm also shows favorable performance in global convergence, efficiency, and robustness. Next, the trust region assisted adaptive response surface method is successfully applied to solve an airfoil aerodynamic optimization problem based on computational fluid dynamics simulation to demonstrate its effectiveness for real-world engineering problems. Finally, limitations of the proposed method and future work are discussed.",56,2
