0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055515,"An underexpanded axisymmetric jet exhausting across an adjacent rigid planar surface generates a unique flowfield that has received little attention in the literature. To date, most published research within this area has been motivated by acoustics, and consequently little flowfield data exist. This study aims to provide such a data set for an axisymmetric jet operating at a nozzle pressure ratio of 5 and shows how variation in the plate-to-surface separation distance results in large-scale changes in the flowfield. High-resolution planar particle image velocimetry data were obtained on the geometrical symmetry plane. These data are complemented by schlieren imagery, surface oil-flow visualization, and steady pressure-sensitive paint measurements. Data were obtained for , 0.55, 0.60, and for the isolated jet (for comparison purposes). The data indicate that the flowfield is dominated by a shock/boundary-layer interaction generated due to the presence of the plate and that the shock/boundary-layer interaction subsequently alters the structure of the jet. The size, strength, and location of the shock/boundary-layer interaction vary as increases. The presence of the surface was also found to inhibit the screech cycle observed in the isolated jet case. The data presented herein form a baseline data set for an ongoing study in which the rigid surface is replaced with a compliant surface.",55,8
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055535,"This paper investigates the effect of turbulence injection using the random flow generation technique at the inlet boundaries of the core and fan channels of a dual-stream nozzle with an external plug. The objective is to reproduce the turbulence rate at the center of the nozzle ducts’ exhaust. The nozzle design and operating conditions are typically those of an aircraft engine at cruise, although the external flow is not simulated. The paper focuses on the effects of the nozzle exhaust turbulence characteristics, namely turbulent length scales and turbulent rate, on the jet flow prediction and the mixing-layer development. The results are discussed in terms of Reynolds-averaged data and spectral content. Turbulence injection over the whole height of the nozzle ducts accelerates the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes to large-eddy simulation transition in both external and internal mixing layers, which is in better agreement with the experimental results. The transition length is further reduced when the injected turbulent ratio is higher but also when the injected turbulent length scale is smaller. Of interest, the shock-cell positioning in the fan jet is also improved using random flow generation, which emphasizes the importance of accounting for upstream turbulence for this type of simulation.",55,8
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055664,"This study investigates the near-field acoustic and hydrodynamic characteristics of an axisymmetric Mach 1.5 air jet exhausting over a nominal one-twentieth-scale jet-blast-deflector/carrier-deck model at impingement distances ranging from 6 to 12 nozzle diameters, and at jet stagnation temperatures up to 1200 K. Particular focus is on documenting the acoustic field along a simulated foul line on the flight deck, where many crew members are located during flight operations. The jet exhausting over the semi-infinite deck surface, in the “grazing-jet” configuration, serves as a baseline for which to assess the changes to the acoustic field resulting from the impingement. When the jet impinges on the deflector, the noise at upstream locations is dominated by impingement noise that is broadband in nature, and results in an increase in the overall sound-pressure level of 5–12 dB above the baseline levels for the 1200 K jet. As the impingement distance is decreased, a higher-energy portion of the jet shear layer interacts with the surface; thus, the acoustic-source strength is inherently higher and the upstream overall sound-pressure levels monotonically increase. Increasing the jet temperature appears to result in more-distributed acoustic sources and to broaden the directionality of the acoustic field.",55,8
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055801,"Recent findings that the common practice of optimizing the frequency response of constant-temperature hot-wire anemometers using a square wave test may result in the system being strongly underdamped have been confirmed. An iterative method based on the energy spectra of the responses to the square-wave perturbations is proposed to achieve an optimal frequency response. The frequency responses at different operating conditions determined from the new and traditional methods are compared to show that the new optimization method can greatly improve the flatness of the frequency response of the constant-temperature hot-wire anemometer for all the operating conditions. It is also found that the constant-temperature hot-wire anemometer respond differently to the rising and falling edges of the square-wave perturbations due to nonlinearity, and this nonlinearity increases with the overheating ratio.",55,8
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055807,"The primary goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of the bidirectional vortex to changes in injection conditions. To achieve this goal, a parametric model is developed to capture the effect of variations in injector quantity, size, velocity, and location. The resulting cold-flow model is simulated using OpenFOAM, an open-source platform for the solution of fluid dynamics problems. The accuracy of the solver is validated through comparisons to existing analytical models. After validation, velocity and pressure profiles are examined to assess the response of the vortex structure to changes in the injector design. It is found that increasing mass flow rate by way of injector number, injector size, and injection velocity all have an amplifying effect on the peak velocity magnification. Changes in the injection height have a negligible effect on the swirl velocity and pressure but a more significant impact on the axial velocity. Finally, the vortex Reynolds number and the swirl number are identified as dimensionless parameters that control the vortex structure.",55,8

Three different bleeding configurations are tested to identify the effectiveness of the control technique compared to a base planform for a broad range of attack angles at Reynolds numbers and . The results indicate that all bleeding configurations alter the flowfield over the planform, where a proper bleeding induces significant improvement on the overall flow pattern. At sufficiently high angle of attack where pronounced surface separation appears on the base planform, the recovery of the vortical structures with significant increases in the magnitude of suction pressure coefficient , which implies the elimination of three-dimensional surface separation, is achieved with the corresponding bleeding configuration. On the contrary, at low attack angles, the bleeding causes reduction in the magnitudes of suction pressure coefficient in general, indicating a loss in suction performance of the planform. To conclude, the results confirm that the bleeding might effectively be used to eliminate the surface separation on nonslender delta wing.",55,8
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055445,"Unsteady turbulent flows inside a suction and oscillatory blowing actuator are simulated and characterized to provide better physical understanding of the complex actuator flows. Large-eddy simulation based upon a novel unstructured-grid technique is used to accurately calculate turbulent flows inside the actuator operating in still air. Simulations are performed for three inlet pressure conditions. Results show good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. The actuator is characterized by parameters such as pressure ratio, outlet velocity profile, oscillation frequency, and suction-to-total flow rates. The large-eddy simulation-generated data are used to develop a reduced-order model applicable to integrated simulation of aerodynamic flow control as an unsteady boundary condition. Dynamic mode decomposition is employed to obtain a lower-order representation of streamwise velocity at the actuator outlets. The frequency-optimized characteristics of dynamic mode decomposition enables to compactly represent the oscillatory turbulent outflows. Using the sparsity-promoting algorithm, an optimal representation of the actuator outflows is systematically derived. Using only two distinct dynamic modes, the sparsity-promoting variant of the standard dynamic mode decomposition algorithm adequately describes unsteady velocity fields at the actuator outlets.",55,8
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055627,"This paper proposes a fluid–structure interaction-based method to restrict the undesirable shock oscillation process due to the downstream pressure perturbation and limit its adverse impact on a two-dimensional supersonic intake. A computational framework is established to illustrate the coupled solutions between the forced shock oscillation and the nonlinear structural vibration. Complex intake aerodynamics are captured with an implicit finite volume method. Finite element code is employed to determine the dynamic response of a flat flexible wall locally installed in a rigid cowl wall. Data transfer between the two physical fields is accomplished with a partitioned coupling scheme. The large-amplitude shock oscillation and poor variation in aerodynamic performance are found in the uncontrolled transient flow solutions of the rigid wall intake model. Conversely, a shock oscillation amplitude reduction of about 50% is achieved by the local flexible wall, and it shows an improvement to the aerodynamic performance of the supersonic intake as well. This paper demonstrates that the dynamic cavity generated by fluid–structure interaction contributes to outstanding performance of this new method. Additionally, the impact of the dynamic cavity is interpreted by two fundamental mechanisms: the local enlarged flowpath with a convergent–divergent shape and energy transfer within the fluid–structure interaction.",55,8
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055767,"A fluidically variable hypersonic inlet with fixed geometry is investigated in this paper by both experimental and numerical methods. The results show that the inlet maintains the shock-on-lip condition both at Mach 4.92 and 5.74 successfully. At Mach 4.92, the shock-on-lip condition is naturally obtained without any need of secondary flow injection. When the inlet operates at Mach 5.74, the fluidic control technique works to prevent the external ramp shocks from entering the duct, and the secondary flow ratio used to control the first and second ramp shocks is 1.03 and 0.67%, respectively. Compared with the fixed-geometry inlet under the same design constraints, the mass flow ratio and the total pressure recovery of the fluidically controlled inlet are improved by 23.8 and 3.95% at Mach 4.92, respectively. While operating at Mach 5.74, the total pressure recovery of the fluidically controlled inlet is slightly lower than the fixed-geometry one because the curved ramp shocks lead to additional total pressure loss. As a result, the fluidically controlled inlet has excellent performance at low operating Mach numbers, which is beneficial to the performance of hypersonic propulsion system at the acceleration stage.",55,8
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055630,"This paper presents an analytic time-domain formulation for acoustic pressure gradient prediction in a moving medium, which has significant application potential in evaluating the acoustic scattering boundary condition. Based on the convective Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings equation, a semianalytic time-domain acoustic pressure gradient formulation with a form involving the observer time differentiation outside the integrals is first developed, and then the desired analytic time-domain acoustic pressure gradient formulation is derived. Because the derived formulations are performed directly in the time domain, they are particularly applicable to the moving observer case. Simulation results for a stationary monopole source, a stationary dipole source, as well as a rotating monopole source in a moving medium demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed formulations for both stationary and moving sources with moving observers.",55,8
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055581,"This paper presents a novel numerical model on unstructured grids for all-speed flows using the multimoment constrained finite volume method, where the point values at both the cell center and cell vertices are updated in time as the computational variables. These two kinds of point values are solved by different numerical procedures with different Riemann solvers, and then they are used as the local degrees of freedom to generate high-order reconstructions. Numerical oscillation is effectively suppressed by a multidimensional limiting projection. The numerical dissipation is controlled by the boundary variation diminishing principle that adaptively chooses the interpolation function so as to minimize the jumps (variations) across the cell boundaries. Numerical results show that the present solver has third-order accuracy for a smooth solution and can resolve both continuous and discontinuous solutions with competitive quality.",55,8
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055106,"A family of algorithms based on implicit Runge–Kutta time integration suitable for unsteady incompressible flow is developed. Spatially discretized momentum equations are integrated in time using implicit Runge–Kutta methods. An equation for pressure is formed by combining the discretized continuity equation with the discretized momentum equations. This family of algorithms, called IRK-SIMPLER, uses only exact discretized mass and momentum equations and requires no relaxation to converge. Two distinct IRK-SIMPLER variants are analyzed. The first variant solves the pressure equation once per time step and has the advantage of fewer computations per time step but is limited to first-order accuracy in time. The second variant centers on reformulating a pressure equation each Runge–Kutta stage by manipulating the momentum stage equations, and this pressure equation is solved multiple times within a time step. The second variant is shown to achieve a higher temporal order of accuracy. By analyzing the largest time step allowable and run time required to achieve time-accurate solutions, the most efficient algorithms in this family are delineated. For the chosen problems, IRK-SIMPLER is able to achieve as high as 101 times speedup compared to the traditional SIMPLER algorithm with Crank–Nicolson time integration using a finite volume discretization scheme.",55,8
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055521,"The inherent relationship between boundary-layer stability, aerodynamic heating, and surface conditions makes the potential for interaction between the structural response and boundary-layer transition an important and challenging area of study in high-speed flows. This interdependence implies that accurate structural response prediction of a hypersonic vehicle necessitates an aerothermoelastic analysis that accounts for boundary-layer stability in regions where transition is likely to occur. This study focuses on this problem by coupling a time-varying boundary-layer state to the aerothermoelastic response of a structural panel in hypersonic flow. Results indicate that the structural response shifts the transition onset location upstream by more than a quarter of the panel length. The forward movement of the transition front is found to be strongly dependent on the panel deformation and is related to a region of adverse pressure resulting from the panel bowing into the flowfield. Additionally, the response of the panel with clamped structural boundary conditions is highly dependent on the transition onset location due to its sensitivity to the spatial variation in the thermal moment.",55,8
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055501,"The development of coherent structures within the laminar separation bubble that forms on a NACA 0018 airfoil at an angle of attack of 8 deg and a chord-based Reynolds number of 100,000 is investigated experimentally. A combination of high-speed flow visualizations and time-resolved surface pressure measurements is used to enable quantitative analysis of vortex dynamics. The amplification of disturbances in the separated shear layer leads to the formation of rollup vortices that are shed upstream of the mean reattachment location. The experimental results show that these structures produce distinct, periodic surface pressure fluctuations that can be used to detect, track, and characterize the rollup vortices. A vortex tracking technique is developed and validated in the present investigation. The developed methodology is used to investigate temporal and spatial variation in vortex shedding parameters and to study attendant vortex interactions, which involve merging of two or more consecutive vortices. The results provide new insight into vortex dynamics in laminar separation bubbles, and the developed technique can serve as an efficient tool for future studies and active flow control implementation.",55,8
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055754,"A 50%-chord trailing edge flap was fitted to a NACA 0006 airfoil spanning the test section of a water tunnel, equipped with a suite of electric linear motors to produce a range of flap deflection frequencies and amplitudes. The fore element of the wing was kept at constant incidence, either at 0 or 20 deg, corresponding to “attached” or “separated” flow cases, respectively. The aim is to ascertain whether lift-coefficient response to flap actuation in separated flow evinces lag from the flap motion, and second, to quantify lift and pitching moment transients beyond quasi-steady conditions, as possible routes toward enabling aggressive maneuvers or mitigation of gust response. Taking advantage of the favorable temporal scaling in water, the flap was deflected at rates of as high as 0.25 convective times. Forces and moments were measured separately at the main airfoil element and at the flap, by respective load cells. The time history of the lift coefficient shows a rise or “spike” proportional to flap pitch rate and no lag in lift response after initiation of actuation, whether the flow is attached or separated and whether the flap begins from zero deflection position or a highly deflected position. Positive or negative lift increment is attainable in an attached or fully separated flow, depending on the direction of flap deflection. Transients in lift are modeled reasonably well by direct superposition of classical analytical models for pitch-rate effects, added mass, and unsteady airfoil theory; pitch rate in particular dominates for the highest-rate flap deflections. The analytical model is, however, unable to account for viscous separation before or after the flap deflection occurs.",55,8

Stationary and plunging wing configurations are examined as representative problems of aircraft wandering, wing vibration, or structural compliance that may all drastically affect the nature of the tip vortex and have important consequences in applications of formation flight, for instance. The high-frequency low-amplitude heaving motion of the wing promotes significant three-dimensionality of the overall flow structure with substantial variations in the tip vortex structure, including shear-layer substructure formation through enhanced separation and stretching, and alternating wakelike and jetlike behavior of its axial flow that leads to transitory enlargement or contraction of its core. The initial low-amplitude vertical displacement of the vortex grows dramatically as the structure advects into the wake, and a significant self-induced orbital motion results, which could be detrimental for downstream aerodynamic surfaces or for reliable vortex tracking in real-world applications. The dynamic state of the vortex as it leaves the wing is also shown to persist well into the wake.",55,8
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055667,"Flapping-wing micro air vehicles are not confined to undergoing the normal-hovering motion implemented by flying insects. In this study, the water-treading motion, which originates from aquatic propulsion, is studied in terms of its feasibility as an alternative wing motion for micro air vehicles. Experimental measurements and numerical simulations have been conducted on a rigid three-dimensional flapping wing undergoing normal-hovering and water-treading motions, with the aim of identifying which motion profile is superior from a purely aerodynamic point of view. Results from the present parametric study show that the water-treading motion offers two main advantages over normal-hovering motion. Firstly, the leading-edge vortex generated by the water-treading motion tends to be more stable, resulting in higher-lift generation. Secondly, whereas normal-hovering motion enters a high-angle-of-attack high-drag configuration during stroke reversal, the water-treading motion avoids this unfavorable configuration. As a result, the water-treading motion offers superior aerodynamic performance in terms of lift generation and efficiency. Hence, it may be an attractive alternative for efficient micro-air-vehicle design.",55,8

The wing undergoes an impulsively started 180 deg revolution about a vertical axis at angles of attack 15, 30, and 45 deg and chord-based Reynolds number 1000. The root cutout is varied at a fixed wing radius, chords, and the effects on the flow structure and aerodynamic performance of the wing are evaluated. It is shown that an optimum in aerodynamic efficiency exists at low root cutout. Results suggest that this optimum is due to the competition between low Reynolds number effects at the wing root and root vortex effects. In addition, it is shown that a large root cutout can inhibit leading-edge vortex burst that occurs at high angles of attack. However, despite the associated recovery in pressure forces near the wing tip, this inhibition has no significant impact on aerodynamic performance.",55,8
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055551,"This paper presents methodology to enable path planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle that uses dynamic data-driven flight capability estimation. The main contribution of the work is a general mathematical approach that leverages offline high-fidelity physics-based modeling together with onboard sensor measurements to achieve dynamic path planning. The mathematical framework, expressed as a constrained partially observable Markov decision process, accounts for vehicle capability constraints and is robust to modeling error and disturbances in both the vehicle process and measurement models. Vehicle capability constraints are incorporated using probabilistic support vector machine surrogates of high-fidelity physics-based models that adequately capture the richness of the vehicle dynamics. Sensor measurements are treated in a general manner and can include combinations of multiple modalities such as that through global positioning system signals, inertial mass unit outputs, and structural strain data of the airframe. Results are presented for a simulated three-dimensional environment and point-mass airplane model. The vehicle can dynamically adjust its trajectory according to the observations it receives about its current state of health, thereby retaining a high probability of survival and mission success.",55,8
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055909,"The effects of stator shroud air injection on aerodynamic performance were investigated for a single-stage axial compressor. Multiobjective optimization of the air injector was performed to maximize the enhancements of the peak adiabatic efficiency and stall margin using three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. The numerical results for adiabatic efficiency and the total pressure ratio were validated with experimental data for a smooth casing. The design variables were determined through a parametric study as the axial distance between stator leading edge and the injector, the radius of the injector surface curvature, the circumferential coverage of the injector, and the injection mass flow rate. The peak adiabatic efficiency and stall margin were selected as the objective functions. Kriging models were constructed using objective function values calculated at 45 design points, which were selected by Latin hypercube sampling to approximate the objective functions. The performances of two different optimization algorithms were compared. The optimization results showed that an efficiency-oriented optimum design presented an increase of 2.47% in the peak adiabatic efficiency when compared with the compressor with a smooth casing, whereas a stall margin-oriented optimum design showed an increase of 1.13% in the stall margin.",55,8
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055237,"For the risk assessment of turbine rotor disks, the probability of failure for a certain type of disk (after flight cycles) is a vital criterion for estimating whether the disk is safe enough to put into use. However, the computing process can be expensive. To increase the efficiency of the risk assessment, this study proposes a numerical integration method based on probability density evolution. That is, by establishing the relationship between the initial probability distribution and the actual distribution after flight cycles, the probability of failure can be determined directly through an initial anomaly distribution using a numerical integration method. To validate the effectiveness and practicality of this method, this paper implements a simple test case to compare the classical Monte Carlo simulation method with the method based on probability density evolution. The results indicate that the method based on probability density evolution shows higher accuracy and speed. In addition, the nondestructive inspection schedule, other related random variables and interfaces with other methods (e.g., important sampling) can also be integrated based on the method proposed in this paper.",55,8

This paper reports a numerical study of two distinct types of preload, mechanical (i.e., independent of flow velocity) and aerodynamic (i.e., dependent on flow velocity), and their effects on limit cycle behavior. Simulations are carried out on models of a wing-with-store and an all-moving surface, respectively, with linear potential flow aerodynamics and a localized structural nonlinearity. Novel, computationally efficient methods based on dual-input describing functions are proposed and employed for calculating limit cycles, thereby generalizing earlier work that used single-input describing functions for the no-preload situation. Results are presented for a smooth nonlinearity (cubic hardening) and a nonsmooth one (classical freeplay), along with selected time marching responses. Finally, the feasibility of including nonlinear aerodynamics in the present framework is discussed.",55,8

The element flexibility matrix is obtained by integrating the complementary-energy density corresponding to six beam equilibrium states, and then inverted and expanded to provide the element-stiffness matrix. Distributed element loads are represented via corresponding internal-force distributions in local equilibrium with the loads. The element formulation does not depend on assumed shape functions and can, in principle, include any variation of cross-sectional properties and load variation, provided that these are integrated with sufficient accuracy in the process.

23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055544,"Because aircraft undergo countless ground and flight scenarios during their service life, a large volume of global load cases must be analyzed in a global finite element model to identify the structural load paths and internal load distributions. Analyzing all load cases is not possible due to computational constraints, so that substantial engineering judgment in load case downselection is required. An approach is proposed to reduce the number of load cases analyzed by using singular-value decomposition to derive a smaller set of characteristic loads that approximates all the global load distributions. Herein, robust error quantification methods are also proposed to allow the definition of the characteristic loads to a targeted accuracy level, so that the calculation of structural failure can also be evaluated with a known precision. The major downstream benefit of the process is that the analysis results for this set of characteristic loads can be superimposed to create the internal load distributions resulting from all the original load cases, with known accuracy. For realistic design and load data, internal loads need to only be calculated for a few tens of characteristic loads rather than thousands of real load cases.",55,8

The camberwise bending deformation of flexible airfoils, described by using the orthogonal Legendre polynomials, is considered in addition to traditional rigid-body plunging and pitching motions. The complete set of aeroelastic equations of motion is derived by following Hamilton’s principle, where a two-dimensional finite-state unsteady aerodynamic theory is applied to calculate the aerodynamic loads of flexible airfoils with both rigid-body motions and arbitrary camber deformations. The finite-state aerodynamic theory is also modified to involve magnitudes of the Legendre polynomials in the aerodynamic load equations. The aeroelastic equations, featuring rigid-body motions and camber deformation magnitudes as independent degrees of freedom, may facilitate the analysis of camber effects on aeroelastic characteristics of flexible airfoils.

Exploring the possibility that in an aerodynamic influence coefficient-based flutter predictions uncertainty is strongly linked to the Mach number zones in which corresponding aerodynamic boxes reside, the relative importance to the flutter velocity and frequency uncertainties of contribution of uncertainties associated with defined Mach number zones on the wing is ranked by using the method of global sensitivity analysis. An alternative approach to aerodynamic uncertainty modeling, focusing on rational function approximation matrix uncertainties, allows examination of the relative impact of uncertainty in aerodynamic stiffness, damping, inertia, or lag terms.

Multiple electron backscatter diffraction scans can be used to sample the uncertainty in orientation distribution function: both point to point within a specimen as well as across multiple specimens that originate from the same manufacturing process. However, microstructure analysis methods typically employ only the mean values of the orientation distribution function to predict properties, and the stochastic information is lost. In this work, analytical methods are developed to account for the uncertainty in the electron backscatter diffraction data during property analysis. To this end, a linear smoothing scheme is developed in the Rodrigues fundamental region to compute the orientation distribution function from the electron backscatter diffraction data. The joint multivariate probability distributions of the orientation distribution function are then modeled using a Gaussian assumption. The uncertainty in engineering properties that are obtained by homogenization are also computed. It is shown that the uncertainty in nonlinear properties can be analytically obtained using direct transformation of random variables in the homogenization approach.",55,8
