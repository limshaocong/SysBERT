0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052973,"This paper investigates numerically the acoustic sources and far-field noise of chevron and round jets. The acoustic sources are described by the fourth-order space–time velocity cross correlations, which are calculated based on a large-eddy simulation flowfield. Gaussian functions are found to fit the axial, radial, and azimuthal cross correlations reasonably well. The axial length scales are three to four times the radial and azimuthal length scales. For the chevron jet, the cross-correlation scales vary with azimuthal angle up to six jet diameters downstream; beyond that, they become axisymmetric like those for a round jet. The fourth-order space–time cross correlation of the axial velocity is the dominant source component, and there are considerable contributions from other source components such as , , , , and cross correlations where 1, 2, and 3 represent axial, radial, and azimuthal directions, respectively. For the chevron jet, these cross correlations decay rapidly with axial distance whereas for the round jet, they remain roughly constant over the first 10 jet diameters. The chevron jet intensifies both the and cross correlations within two jet diameters of the jet exit. The amplitude, length, and time scales of the cross-correlations of a large-eddy simulation velocity field are investigated as functions of position and are found to be proportional to the turbulence amplitude, length, and time scales that are determined from a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculation. The constants of proportionality are found to be independent of position within the jet, and they are quite close for chevron and round jets. The scales derived from Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes are used for source description, and an acoustic analogy is used for sound propagation. There is an excellent agreement between the far-field noise predictions and measurements. At low frequencies, the chevron nozzle significantly reduces the far-field noise by 5–6 dB at 30 deg and 2–3 dB at 90 deg to the jet axis. However, the chevron nozzle slightly increases high-frequency noise. It was found that and cross correlations have the largest contribution to the jet noise at 30 deg to the jet axis, whereas the cross correlation has the largest contribution to the jet noise at 90 deg to the jet axis. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes calculations are repeated with different turbulence models, and the noise prediction is found to be almost insensitive to the turbulence model. The results indicate that the modeling approach is capable of assessing advanced noise-reduction concepts.",53,9

The arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian form of the unsteady, compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with a generic source term is considered, and from these governing flow equations, an adjoint formulation centered around finding surface sensitivities using shape calculus is derived. This surface formulation provides the gradient information necessary for performing gradient-based aerodynamic shape optimization at a computational cost equivalent to solving the flow equations and with minimal memory overhead. To verify the methodology, gradients provided by the continuous adjoint and finite-differencing approaches are compared. Optimal shape design is demonstrated in both two and three dimensions for pitching airfoil and wing test cases.",53,9

The resulting dynamic loads can induce a response of the launcher structure called buffeting. To study the characteristics of the base flow behind three different configurations of the Ariane 5 launcher, improved delayed detached-eddy simulation in combination with unstructured grids is used. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of improved delayed detached-eddy simulation to describe the impact of the connecting struts between central stage and boosters and to analyze the efficiency of a buffeting reduction device in the base region. Comparisons of the numerical results with time-resolved and time-averaged surface pressure data and particle-image-velocimetry measurements obtained from the German–Dutch High Speed Wind Tunnel are carried out in good agreement.",53,9
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053295,"Airfoils in gas turbine engines used for aeropropulsion are actively cooled by film cooling; and, to cost-effectively optimize or control the film-cooling behavior, reduced-order models combined with a suitable control strategy are needed. Motivated by this film-cooling application, a linear state feedback controller for stabilization of a proper orthogonal decomposition-based reduced-order model of a film-cooling jet injected over the airfoil surface into a hot crossflow is presented. A full-order direct numerical simulation of the jet in crossflow is used to generate the data required to build the reduced-order model. The control objective is to prevent the mixing of the coolant jet and hot gases from the combustor so that the coolant remains close to the blade surface. The kinetic energy of the turbulent flow is used as a measure of mixing, which in turn is used to guide the design of a desired steady-state condition with low kinetic energy. The linear controller guarantees that the nonlinear reduced-order model will be driven to the desired steady state if the system is operating inside a region of quadratic attraction. The controller gain and region of quadratic attraction are easily calculated by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities. In addition, the suggestion is made to utilize a switching strategy to deal with the case in which the state of the reduced-order model is outside of the calculated region of quadratic attraction. Results show that in closed-loop, the reduced-order model is completely stabilized, whereas the direct numerical simulation is only stabilized for a period of time.",53,9

This model is based on the representation of the flow as the sum of the mean and the periodic components. The governing equations for both components are derived from the Navier–Stokes equations using time averaging. The momentum equations for the mean component comprise additional source terms that result from averaging the quadratic periodic terms. These source terms allow the control of separation. A numerical procedure has been developed to solve these equations along with equations of periodic flow, and to study the influence of inflow conditions, namely, frequency, amplitude, and the station where the excitation is inserted on the mean flow. Using this procedure, one can check if the given inflow conditions suppress the leading-edge separation of the flow over a parabola.",53,9

This spectral method is used to solve a system of five highly coupled, linear partial differential equations, generated by the higher-order shear deformation theory-based laminated shell analysis, with the simply supported of type 2 boundary condition prescribed on two opposite edges, whereas the remaining two edges are subjected to the simply supported of type 3 constraint.

The main goal is to find a function for an additional amplification factor that can be incorporated into the method. In the present study, both two-dimensional direct numerical simulation of disturbances as well as linear stability theory are used to gain detailed information on the flow. Good agreement between -factor results from direct numerical simulation and linear stability theory is obtained. Subsonic and slightly supersonic results show differences in the flow topology and in the shape of the -factor curve, but effective factors are in the same order of magnitude.",53,9
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053666,"A localized heating or cooling effect on stability of the boundary-layer flow on a sharp cone at zero angle of attack and freestream Mach number 6 is analyzed. Experiments were carried out in the Transit-M wind tunnel of the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (Novosibirsk, Russia) for different heating/cooling intensities and freestream Reynolds numbers. The mean flows with localized heating/cooling are calculated using axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations. These solutions are used for the spatial linear stability analysis to estimate the transition onset points using the method. Direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional disturbances propagating in the boundary layer through the cooled/heated region are performed. The experiment and computations showed similar qualitative trends. The localized cooling decreases the second-mode amplitude and delays transition. The heating produced an opposite effect, which is less pronounced.",53,9
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053690,"This paper presents a practical and effective framework for updating landing gear finite element component models such that the updated reduced-order component mode synthesis model of the entire assembled system can provide accurate structural dynamic results in any possible landing gear configuration. By constructing component mode synthesis matrices using updated finite element parameters, the requirement to experimentally derive the modes required for component mode synthesis is avoided. Because it is impossible to directly measure joint frequency response functions, the experimental substructure boundary conditions are made to mimic natural joint-link connectivity by using flexible-hinged boundaries with links and joint hinges in arbitrary orientations. This exploits the fact that experimental frequency response functions obtained away from the joints can contain information about the joint dynamics, which result in resonance frequency shifts. The updating of each component model in multiple possible configurations is performed using a genetic algorithm with bounded inequality constraints on the updating parameters and nonlinear constraints on frequency response function parameters (natural frequencies, antiresonances, and fixture motion). Afterward, the updated flexible-hinged supports are analytically removed for final system component mode synthesis assembly. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated with an experimental case study on a simplified landing gear model. Overall, the updating method can enable further dynamic testing of the complete system in a virtual environment, thereby reducing the need for extensive experimental testing on entire landing gear assemblies.",53,9
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053700,"A substantial number of large-eddy simulations are conducted on separated flow controlled by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator at a Reynolds number of 63,000. In the present paper, the separated flow over a NACA 0015 airfoil at an angle of attack of 12 deg, which is just poststall, is used as the base flow for separation control. The effects of the location and operating conditions of the plasma actuator on the separation control are investigated by a parametric study. The control effect is evaluated based on the improvement of not only the lift coefficient but also the drag coefficient over an airfoil. The most effective location of the plasma actuator for both lift and drag improvement is precisely confirmed to be upstream of the natural separation point. Even a low burst ratio is found to be sufficient to obtain the same improvements as the cases with a high burst ratio. The effective nondimensional burst frequency is observed at for the improvement in the lift coefficient and at for that in the drag coefficient. The lift/drag ratio shows a clear peak at . To clarify the mechanism of the laminar-separation control, the effect of a turbulent transition is investigated. There is a clear relationship between the separation control effect and the turbulent transition at the shear layer. An earlier and smoother transition case shows greater improvements in the lift and drag coefficients. Flow analyses show that the cases with early and smooth turbulent transition can attach the separated flow further upstream, resulting in a higher suction peak of the pressure coefficient. In addition, another mechanism of the separation control is observed in which the lift coefficient is improved, not by the reattachment through the turbulent transition but by the large-scale vortex shedding induced by the actuation. It is possible to separate these two dominant mechanisms based on the effect of the turbulent transition on the separation control.",53,9
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053421,"Meteoroids entering the Earth atmosphere at high hypersonic velocities are sources of sonic booms that are recorded as infrasound signals at the ground level. The boom pressure field is simulated by solving Euler equations for a spherical meteoroid. The numerical challenge is to capture the acoustical regime of weak shock waves in the very far field at several hundreds or thousands times the meteoroid diameter. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are then matched to nonlinear geometrical acoustics for long-range atmospheric propagation down to the ground. The numerical process is validated through comparison with an analytical model, considering for perfect gases the meteoroid as a line source of strong shock in the near field, matched to a weak shock -wave in the far field. Compared with a perfect gas, real gas effects at thermochemical equilibrium induce a reduced amplitude at the source, along with a shorter signal duration at the ground level. Simulations are illustrated for the well-documented Carancas meteorite that impacted on Peru in 2007.",53,9
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053679,"A methodology termed entropy filtered density function (En-FDF) is developed to account for entropy transport in large eddy simulation of turbulent flows. The filtered entropy transport equation includes several unclosed terms which are the subgrid scale entropy flux and the filtered entropy generation resulting from irreversibilities in heat conduction, mass diffusion, chemical reaction and viscous dissipation. The En-FDF contains the complete statistical information about entropy, velocity, scalar and turbulent frequency fields and thus, provides closure for all the unclosed terms in the filtered transport equations. An exact transport equation is derived for the En-FDF which contains the effects of convection along with chemical reaction and its associated entropy generation in closed forms. The En-FDF transport is modeled by a set of stochastic differential equations. The numerical solution procedure is based on a hybrid finite difference/Monte Carlo method in which the large eddy simulation filtered transport equations are solved by the finite difference, and the stochastic differential equations are solved by a Lagrangian Monte Carlo procedure. This methodology is applied for large eddy simulation of a turbulent shear layer involving transport of passive scalars and predictions are compared against the data generated by direct numerical simulation. The En-FDF predictions show favorable agreement with the direct numerical simulation data.",53,9
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053713,"Aeroacoustic predictions of a model airframe noise problem are conducted to assess the effects of wake interaction on flow and acoustic fields. Simulations of unsteady low Reynolds number flows, including both noise generation and its subsequent propagation to the far field, are performed for a configuration composed of a cylinder placed above a NACA 0012 airfoil. An assessment of cylinder position and freestream Mach number effects on sound radiation is presented. It is observed that intense interference among cylinder and airfoil dipoles occurs for all configurations analyzed. In this case, each body scatters the sound emitted by the other. For moderate Mach number flows with wake interaction, quadrupole sources become important to the total acoustic prediction, specially for the downward noise radiation. In order to investigate how wake interaction affects noise radiation, a comparison between the current model problem with a single cylinder case is presented. Results show that wake interaction becomes a major feature of the airfoil-cylinder flow, causing a faster downstream decay of convecting disturbances when compared to the isolated cylinder case. This issue is further studied using a linear stability calculation for the wake interaction problem, which shows that for higher Mach numbers, compressibility effects lead to the formation of a wave-packet structure in the wake with higher maximum amplitude, higher convection Mach number and a sudden spatial decay. Therefore, wake interaction and compressibility effects play a key role in the present model problem and are proposed as responsible for the increase of quadrupole noise radiation.",53,9
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053706,"This study numerically investigates the aerodynamic effects of deformation on three-dimensional low aspect ratio wings engaged in hover kinematics. The immersed-boundary finite-volume method is used to solve the Navier–Stokes equations. Deformations are actively prescribed and are represented as deflections about axes that transect the rectangular planform. Two distinct deformation modes associated with tip and root deflection are explored, in addition to a rigid wing counterpart. Variation of the phase between deflection and flapping enables mimicry of a range of wing behavior observed in nature. It is found the introduction of root or tip deflection can increase efficiency by as much as 19.5% or 19.0% respectively. The development of vortical structures about the wing is investigated. It is shown that while the rotational axis of the leading-edge vortex is insensitive to deformation, the shape and orientation of cores of the vortex is modified.",53,9

Wind tunnel testing was performed on one airfoil with a sharp trailing edge (NACA 0012) and two airfoils featuring a blunt trailing edge (ellipse and DBLN-526). Time-resolved particle image velocimetry and smoke flow visualization were used to identify three reverse flow wake regimes: slender body vortex shedding, turbulent, and deep stall vortex shedding. The slender body regime is present for low angles of attack and low Reynolds numbers. In the turbulent regime, separation occurs in reverse flow at the sharp aerodynamic leading edge of a NACA 0012, whereas flow separation occurs further down the chord of airfoils with a blunt geometric trailing edge. The deep stall vortex shedding frequency was measured using unsteady force balance measurements. The Strouhal number (based on the projected diameter of the airfoils) was found to be for , which is well below the value of for a corresponding cylinder. The results of the work presented here provide fundamental insight for rotor applications where flow separation and vortex shedding due to reverse flow can lead to unsteady loading, vibrations, and fatigue.",53,9

The Reynolds number, based on momentum thickness upstream of separation, is at a free-stream velocity of . The results indicate that the flow is characterized by two separate time-dependent phenomena: a low-frequency mode, with a Strouhal number , which is related to a global “breathing” motion (i.e., contraction/expansion) of the separation bubble, and a higher-frequency mode, with a Strouhal number , which is linked to the roll-up of vortical structures in the shear layer above the recirculating region and their shedding downstream of the bubble. These two phenomena are reminiscent of the “flapping” and “shedding” modes observed in fixed-separation experiments, though their normalized frequencies are different. The breathing mode is also shown to be strikingly similar to the low-frequency unsteadiness observed in shock-induced separated flows at supersonic speeds.",53,9

An aircraft model and the surrounding flow field obtained from high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation are swept through a ground-fixed computational domain to initialize the wake. After the wake initialization a large-eddy simulation of the vortical wake is performed until vortex decay. In this paper the methodology is tested with a NACA 0012 wing and applied to the DLR-F6 wing-body model in cruise condition and a long-range aircraft model in high-lift configuration which was used in the European Aircraft Wing with Advanced Technology Operation project. The correlation between the detailed roll-up process of the vorticity sheet shedding from the main wing and the characteristics of the rolled-up vortex pair such as vortex circulation, core radius, and separation is investigated with and without ambient turbulence. In both the DLR-F6 wing-body and the long-range aircraft models, the behavior of the formed vortex pair appears similar to that of a vortex pair defined by an analytical vortex model including the impact of ambient turbulence on vortex linking and decay. The velocity profile of a fully rolled-up vortex pair at around agrees well with the Rosenhead–Burnham–Hallock vortex model.",53,9

Such a reduced-order model is trained on a series of signals that implicitly represent the relationship between the structural motion and the aerodynamic loads. The determination of the model parameters is obtained through a two-level training procedure where, in the first stage, the matrices associated to the linear part of the model are computed by a robust subspace projection technique, whereas the remaining nonlinear terms are determined by an output error-minimization procedure in the second stage. The present approach is tested on two different problems, proving the convergence toward the reference results obtained by a computational fluid dynamics solver in linear and nonlinear, aerodynamic, and aeroelastic applications, whereas the aerodynamic reduced-order models are coupled with the related structural mechanical systems, demonstrating the ability of capturing the main nonlinear features of the response. The robustness of the reduced-order model is then tested considering a series of inputs with varying amplitudes and frequencies outside the range of interest and computing aeroelastic responses with nonnull pretwist angles.",53,9
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053786,"To this date, there is no generally valid method to accurately predict intake starting for a certain three-dimensional scramjet intake configuration. Therefore, experiments are conducted at Mach 6 and 7 in a blowdown wind tunnel on a three-dimensional intake model, equipped with a movable cowl and therefore variable internal contraction. The internal contraction is slowly decreased, and the performance parameters at the interface to the combustion chamber are measured with a rake. The general trends from the Kantrowitz diagram were able to be reproduced, namely enhanced intake starting for higher freestream Mach numbers and lower internal contraction ratios. Furthermore, the effect of the angle of attack was twofold: When the intake was pitched, the leading-edge shock decreased in strength, and the intake showed improved starting characteristics. For increasing yaw angles, intake starting was hindered. Exchanging the -shaped cowl with a straight-cowl geometry improved intake starting due to the additional mass spillage. Once the intake was started, increasing the internal contraction ratio to 2.56 did not cause the intake to unstart for all Mach numbers investigated.",53,9

As a consequence, the issue of laminar flow has been of prime importance in aeronautics for many years now. This article is focused on Tollmien–Schlichting-induced transition and drag predictions of two-dimensional laminar airfoils obtained with experimental and numerical methods. In 2012, a test campaign in the ONERA-S2MA wind tunnel, including infrared acquisitions, pressure sensors, and wake analyses, allowed substantial data to be obtained on such airfoils in transonic conditions. To complete this study, two-dimensional fluid dynamics computations have been performed, either with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver using transition criteria or with a boundary-layer code combined with direct stability analysis. Furthermore, experimental (wake survey) and numerical (far-field theory) techniques allowing airfoil drag breakdown have been employed. Wind-tunnel and computational fluid dynamics transition predictions have been compared. Good agreement has been observed but the transition criteria may show some limitations in particular situations, such as long separation bubble development. The gains in lift and drag due to laminar flow have been quantified (natural vs triggered transition). Concerning drag reduction, the importance of the viscous pressure component has been highlighted. Finally, the effects of parameters such as angle of attack, Mach number, and Reynolds number on transition location and drag have been investigated.",53,9
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053790,"The rising demand for reliable wind-tunnel flow data for rocket nozzle design applications led to the development of a new type of facility. Most of the former experimental data in the literature were gathered in conditions far from those encountered in real engines and combustion gas generators. Thus, they are not appropriate for the physical interpretation of complex flow phenomena and computational fluid dynamic tools validation. The new experimental platform is intended to solve this problem by its capability to nearly match most of these conditions. It allows for the investigation of several engine-relevant aerothermodynamic problems such as boundary-layer transition, nozzle flow separation, nozzle exhaust plume interactions, etc. Furthermore, innovative nozzle cooling techniques like film cooling can be studied in this new type of facility. This is demonstrated first by the experimental results given at the end of this paper. High nozzle reservoir pressures and temperatures are achieved by means of detonative combustion of a premixed gas in a confined tube. A detonation wave produces a high-energy flow that expands through a Laval nozzle to the desired experimental flow conditions. The facility simulates enginelike conditions in a combustion environment for various mass ratios of oxidizer–fuel mixtures. The short-duration flow device affords a simple and cost-effective research tool for testing under harsh flow conditions in laboratories. Hence, it will significantly contribute to the understanding of complex rocket nozzle flow phenomena and validation of numerical tools, as well as correlations.",53,9

An elliptical jet with an aspect ratio equal to two is studied at a nozzle pressure ratio of 2.2. Two-point correlation analysis of the schlieren image sets suggests that the flow is dominated by a flapping mode about the major axis plane, however, a proper orthogonal decomposition of the transverse velocity field suggests that there is also a helical mode that becomes dominant further downstream. The flapping mode appears to grow, saturate, and decay more rapidly and is associated with the production of discrete acoustic tones in the form of jet screech, whereas no discrete tone sound production is observed from the helical mode. It is suggested that the lack of tonal generation by the helical mode is linked to its slower growth; it does not produce coherent fluctuations in shear layer vorticity in the vicinity of the jet shock cells.",53,9

The Taylor–Green vortex benchmark problem at is used as a simple a priori test of the numerics. Dissipation rates computed from kinetic energy, vorticity, and pressure dilatation are plotted against reference solutions. Results show that, at low mesh resolution, the flux reconstruction schemes are highly accurate across a range of orders of accuracy, although oscillations can appear in the solution at orders of six and above. Although the flux reconstruction method has a built-in stabilization mechanism, an additional means of damping these instabilities is required. The schemes vary in the amount of numerical dissipation and resolution of the turbulent spectrum.

The airflow was heated to approximately 1200 K in the facility heater upstream of the nozzle. Dual-pump coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy was used to measure the rotational and vibrational temperatures of and at two planes in the duct. The expectation was that the vibrational temperature would be in equilibrium, because most scramjet facilities are vitiated air facilities and are in vibrational equilibrium. However, with a flow of clean air, the vibrational temperature of along a streamline remains approximately constant between the measurement plane and the facility heater, the vibrational temperature of in the duct is about 1000 K, and the rotational temperature is consistent with the isentropic flow. The measurements of vibrational temperature enabled cross-stream nonuniformities in the temperature exiting the facility heater to be documented. The measurements are in agreement with computational fluid dynamics models employing separate lumped vibrational and translational/rotational temperatures.
