0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053291,"An approach has been developed to use the strain sensed in a membrane wing to estimate aerodynamic loads. Through experimental and theoretical correlation of membrane strain state due to a normally distributed load, the pressure over the surface of the wing was estimated. Elastic deformations and strains of the membrane wing were measured in a low-speed wind tunnel using digital image correlation. Simultaneously, aerodynamic loads were measured using a six-component load cell, inclinometer, and pitot tube. Digital image correlation displacement measurements were used to form a reduced-order model of the membrane displacements via a snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition method. Digital image correlation strain measurements were used to form virtual strain sensors, which served as the sensory input to the estimation. The Poisson equation for a two-dimensional linear-elastic membrane with out-of-plane deformation was used to calculate the normal pressure distribution from virtual strain sensors using proper orthogonal decomposition basis functions and a recursive least-squares minimization. Estimated pressure distributions were compared with a high-fidelity three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic model and pressures were calculated from digital image correlation deformations. Coefficients of lift and pitching moment for steady-state flow conditions were estimated and compared with measured wind-tunnel loads. Results show promise toward the application of a low-fidelity estimation approach for real-time load-estimation applications.",53,8
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053367,"A straightforward implicit smoothing method implemented in several codes solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations is the lower–upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel method. It was proposed several years ago and is attractive to implement because of its low memory requirements and low operation count. Since, for many examples, often a severe restriction of the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy number and loss of robustness are observed, it is the goal of this paper to revisit the lower–upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel implementation and to discuss several alternative implicit smoothing strategies used within an agglomeration multigrid for unstructured meshes. The starting point is a full implicit multistage Runge–Kutta method. Based on this method, several additional features and simplifications are developed and suggested, such that the implicit method is applicable to high-Reynolds-number viscous flows; that is, the required matrices fit into the fast memory of the cluster hardware and the arising linear systems can be approximately solved efficiently. To this end, the focus is on simplifications of the Jacobian, as well as efficient iterative approximate solution methods. To significantly improve the approximate linear solution methods, grid anisotropy is taken care of for approximately solving both the linear systems and the agglomeration strategy. The procedure creating coarse-grid meshes is extended by strategies identifying structured parts of the mesh. This seems to improve the quality of coarse-grid meshes in the way that an overall better reliability of the multigrid can be observed. Furthermore, grid information is exploited within the iterative solution methods for the linear systems. Numerical examples demonstrate the gain with respect to reliability and efficiency.",53,8
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053432,"The effects of adverse pressure gradients on the receptivity and stability of hypersonic boundary layers were numerically investigated. Simulations were performed for boundary-layer flows over a straight cone and two flared cones. The steady and the unsteady flowfields were obtained by solving the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations in axisymmetric coordinates using the fifth-order-accurate weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme for space discretization and using a third-order total-variation-diminishing Runge–Kutta scheme for time integration. The mean boundary-layer profiles were analyzed using local stability and nonlocal parabolized stability equations methods. After the most amplified disturbances were identified, two-dimensional plane acoustic waves were introduced at the outer boundary of the computational domain and time-accurate simulations were performed. The adverse pressure gradient was found to affect the boundary-layer stability in two important ways. First, the frequency of the most amplified second-mode disturbance was increased relative to the zero-pressure gradient case. Second, the amplification of first- and second-mode disturbances was increased. Although an adverse pressure gradient enhances instability wave growth rates, small nose-tip bluntness was found to delay transition due to the low receptivity coefficient and the resulting weak initial amplitude of the instability waves. The computed and measured amplitude-frequency spectra in all three cases agree very well in terms of frequency and the shape except for the amplitude.",53,8

Two systems are considered, defined by the relative location of the actuators on the membrane. The finite element method is used to generate linear time-invariant models in the second-order form. The number of elements used in the finite element method is determined via a systematic analysis based on the convergence of fundamental natural frequencies and mode shapes. Characteristics that are essential for system analysis and control design such as stability, controllability, and observability are investigated using methods based on the linear time-invariant first-order form of the linear equations of motion and methods based on the linear time-invariant second-order form directly generated via the finite element method. Comparisons between the accuracy and reliability of these methods are performed. Next, modern control problems aimed at minimizing vibrations and the control energy are formulated using the linearized equations of motion. The feasibility of using the linear time-invariant second-order form in solving these problems is illustrated. Comparisons of responses to initial conditions perturbations for systems that rely only on material damping and systems that rely on a control system to damp out membrane vibrations are performed, indicating the effectiveness of modern feedback control in damping out vibrations.",53,8

The nominal flow solver is an unsteady Euler solver based on a stationary Cartesian grid using transpiration boundary conditions. With Hilbert transformation, a novel damping-related cost function is defined for which the shape sensitivity can be computed by the new unsteady aerostructure coupled adjoint method. The capability of the new method is demonstrated by a successful airfoil shape optimization for flutter suppression.",53,8
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053614,"A prediction method is developed based on the acoustic analogy for the cross-power spectral density in the convecting near field of compressible fluid turbulence. Equivalent source near-field, midfield, and far-field terms within the model integrand create corresponding near-field, midfield, and far-field radiating waves. These equivalent sources are modeled with a single equation for the two-point cross correlation of the Lighthill stress tensor that is dependent on the jet operating conditions. An alternative equivalent source model based on steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solutions is proposed. The cross-power spectral density model automatically reduces to a traditional autopower spectral density model when observers are at the same location. Predictions of radiation intensity and coherence compare favorably with measurements in the near field, midfield, and far field for a wide range of jet Mach numbers and temperature ratios.",53,8
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053641,"An investigation on the dynamic-stall-suppression capabilities of combustion-powered actuation applied to a tabbed VR-12 airfoil is presented. In the first section, the results from the computational fluid dynamics simulations carried out at Mach numbers of 0.3 and 0.4 are presented. Several geometric parameters are varied, including the slot chordwise location and angle. Actuation-pulse amplitude, frequency, and timing are also varied. The two-dimensional simulations suggest that cycle-averaged lift increases of approximately 4 and 8% with respect to the baseline airfoil are possible at Mach numbers of 0.4 and 0.3 for deep and near-deep dynamic-stall conditions. In the second section, the static-stall results from low-speed wind-tunnel experiments are presented. The low-speed experiments and high-speed computational fluid dynamics suggest that slots oriented tangential to the airfoil surface produce stronger benefits than slots oriented normal to the chord line. The low-speed experiments confirm that chordwise slot locations suitable for Mach 0.3–0.4 stall suppression (based on computational fluid dynamics) will also be effective at lower Mach numbers.",53,8
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053651,"The dynamic velocity range of particle image velocimetry is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum resolvable displacement. Although many techniques have been developed in recent years to extend the dynamic range, flows with a wide velocity range still challenge conventional particle image velocimetry. Using multiple-pulse-separation acquisition and a new criterion for the local optimal pulse separation, this paper presents a novel time-resolved high-dynamic-range particle-image-velocimetry methodology. The algorithm maximizes a vector quality metric combining the correlation peak ratio with the estimated local displacement uncertainty and magnitude, expressed as a modified signal-to-noise ratio. Using an axisymmetric turbulent jet as a benchmark case, significant enhancements are shown in the measured turbulence intensity and signal-to-noise ratio throughout the flowfield, but especially in the entrainment region and the outer shear layer. For this case, high-dynamic-range particle image velocimetry increases the dynamic velocity range by 16.5 times compared to conventional double-frame particle image velocimetry. Hot-wire anemometry is used in characteristic flowfield locations as a reference measurement. The results show that time-resolved high-dynamic-range particle image velocimetry automatically selects the optimal pulse separation in each location as a function of time. The method relies only on readily available data, has a low computational cost, and is fully compatible with conventional multigrid vector evaluation algorithms.",53,8

By using an unsupervised learning algorithm, solutions are grouped into clusters of similar features. The input parameter space is divided into subregions by decision boundaries based on a supervised learning algorithm. Local reduced-order bases are extracted on each cluster, for which the solutions are represented as a linear combination of the basis vectors from their corresponding subregion. The proposed methodology is employed to conduct a comprehensive, exploration of the in-flight icing certification envelopes.",53,8
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053620,"Dielectric barrier discharge actuators are promising candidates for supersonic boundary-layer transition control because of their ability to concentrate energy transfer in receptive regions in the depth of the boundary layer. A detailed understanding of the plasma–flow coupling mechanisms and optimum scaling in compressible flows is necessary to develop efficient actuation schemes. In this work, the dielectric barrier discharge momentum transfer to an unstable laminar boundary layer over a flat plate under different Reynolds and freestream Mach numbers is studied. A new coupled plasma–compressible flow solver using a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement algorithm is presented, which was developed to model the force field generated by the actuator. The spectral components of the force are used as source terms for the study of the influence of flow conditions and length scales on linear receptivity.",53,8
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053599,"Tow-steered composites are optimized for use in tailoring the aeroelastic behavior of a simple two-dimensional composite wing, with particular emphasis on improving both flutter/divergence airspeeds and gust loads. Symmetric layups are considered where the fibers vary in orientation along the wingspan and chord. Tow-steered laminates were found to increase the instability airspeed by up to 7% compared with optimized straight-fiber laminates and by 13% compared with optimized laminates with standard plies. Tow-steered laminates were also found to reduce the peak wing root gust loads (up to 52%) and the correlated gust loads (up to 24%). The lowest gust loads were reached with higher order nonlinear fiber angle variations when either all plies were optimized or when two-dimensional fiber angle variations were used. Optimization strategies that allowed the fiber angles to vary freely in each ply generally performed better than optimizations based on the rotation of -ply stacks along the span of the wing.",53,8
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053632,"Accurate turbulence modeling remains a critical problem in the prediction capability of computational fluid dynamics. In this paper, a new one-equation eddy-viscosity model is derived from closure. The equation used in this derivation includes a cross-diffusion term that allows the new model to switch between the model properties exhibited by the two-equation or turbulence models. In addition, the damping function used in conjunction with the proposed one-equation model has not been studied before in the literature. The new model is used to simulate several benchmark canonical flows involving both the free shear layer and wall-bounded turbulent flows with small separation regions. The open-source software OpenFOAM is used for the flowfield calculations. It is shown that the new model improves the accuracy of flow simulations compared to the widely used one-equation Spalart–Allmaras model and is competitive with the shear-stress-transport model.",53,8
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053600,"Innovative hybrid materials developed at Delft University of Technology (e.g., ARALL and GLARE) dramatically reduce life-cycle costs and offer a great opportunity for service life extension of legacy aircraft. Replacement or repair of damaged aircraft components requires high-strength composite materials with high tailorability, fatigue, and impact-damage resistance, all of which are offered by the advanced hybrid materials. In addition, a reliable fatigue-life evaluation methodology for hybrid structures of arbitrary layup, configuration, constituent materials, and geometry is necessary. An efficient computational framework is presented for simulation of fatigue fracture in fiber–metal laminates based on the homogenized laminate modeled with large shell elements and cohesive zone used to simulate crack propagation. The cohesive traction–separation relationship is calibrated against the analytical solution for the strain-energy release rate, which explicitly accounts for the effect of fiber bridging. Appropriate calibration of the cohesive energy results in approximately constant crack-growth rate, a characteristic for fiber–metal laminates, as well as an accurate distribution of bridging stresses for the considered crack and delamination configurations. The proposed methodology is illustrated by simulating an experimental test conducted on a large glass-laminate-aluminum-reinforced-epoxy panel subjected to a constant-amplitude fatigue loading.",53,8
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053378,"Combustor–inlet interaction is a longstanding classic problem in airbreathing propulsion engineering that is still not fully understood, as evidenced by frequently occurring flight-test unstart events. This study aims at providing a rigorous classification of combustor–inlet interactions that will permit the efficient diagnosis of unstart events, and improve the overall reliability of propulsion systems. Using the proposed mathematical method, the full range of possible interactions can be well defined within the framework of the classification. Specifically, the existence of 11 finite, rigorously separable types of combustor–inlet interactions in ramjet flow is shown. The classification is achieved by first defining the problem as classifying the hysteresis behaviors that occur during combustor–inlet interactions, and then proposing a general method for classifying the hysteresis behaviors of multistable systems, which is also applicable to ramjet flow. Besides the mathematical aspects, novel nondimensional parameters are defined to formulate the classification criteria for the purpose of providing a physical insight into the problem. The findings reported here will lead to a more complete understanding of combustor–inlet interactions, and can be used as a theoretical basis to analyze the complex interactions involved in ground and flight experiments.",53,8
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053664,"Aerodynamics of cambered airfoils are investigated numerically, using a NACA four-digit series of 6% thickness at low Reynolds number and moderate Mach number , by focusing on the relation of aeroacoustic effects and hydrodynamic flow unsteadiness. Two-dimensional numerical simulations show that the onset of an acoustic feedback loop leads to an abrupt increase in lift force. Associated with the feedback process, the evolution of two-dimensional vortices in the suction-side boundary layer shifts a separation bubble toward the leading edge, which causes a relatively steep pressure recovery near the trailing edge. Through a parametric study on airfoil shape, the aerodynamically favorable feature of aft camber is further enhanced with the presence of an acoustic feedback loop. In addition, the aft camber airfoil successfully forms a laminar separation bubble in three-dimensional calculations at the present Reynolds number, developing transitional behavior on the suction side, supposedly prompted by the airfoil tones. Although the boundary layer shows three-dimensional complexity, still the formation of an acoustic feedback loop is strongly suggested, via the comparison of spanwise correlations.",53,8
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053670,"Control of a laminar separation bubble on a two-dimensional NACA 0009 was investigated experimentally in an open-return wind tunnel using particle image velocimetry measurements at a range of chord-based Reynolds numbers between and . In this study, flow control was accomplished through a row of surface-mounted electroactive polymers, centered at 20% of the airfoil chord. A three-dimensional separation bubble was seen to exist when the airfoil’s angle of attack was set at 5 deg, in agreement with the literature. Furthermore, the streamwise and cross-stream extents of the bubble decrease with the increase of the Reynolds number. To mitigate the separation bubble, the electroactive polymers were actuated at a frequency corresponding to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of the separated mixing layer. This frequency was found by applying the solution to the Michalke spatial stability analysis to the experimental data. Activation of the electroactive polymers resulted in mitigation of the separation bubble, as evidenced from suppression of reverse flow within the near-surface velocity profiles.",53,8
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053685,"High spatial resolution measurements of local flow velocities and temperature distributions are crucial for understanding turbulent, high-speed, and reacting flows. In this paper, we demonstrate that femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging, a recently developed molecular tagging velocimetry method, can also be used to simultaneously measure temperature. A 150 femtosecond pulse populates excited molecular nitrogen states, driving significant emission from the nitrogen second positive and first negative systems. Spectroscopy of this emission allows temperature to be determined from the distribution of rotational molecular energy. Temperature profiles are measured with better than 10% uncertainty and spatial resolution between 300 and 650 K in heated jets. This method is expected to be valid up to at least 2000 K. Femtosecond laser electronic excitation tagging temperature and velocity measurements involve separate nitrogen transitions and can be conducted simultaneously without interference.",53,8
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053691,"In this paper, a new model is built to treat two-phase flows with a carrier phase laden with compressible liquid droplets. In some applications, the pressure in the carrier phase varies so much that it obviously should impact the droplet’s specific mass and temperature. This may be the case, for example, in solid rocket motors, where liquid droplets of aluminum at high temperature are ejected through a nozzle and endure pressure variations from 50 bar to atmospheric pressure or less. The same kind of problem may be observed in physics of explosive or in astrophysics. In these cases, a more precise description of the dispersed phase may be useful. Moreover, in extreme cases, it may become irrelevant to continue using a pressureless model for the dispersed phase, especially if a phase change or chemical reaction occurs. Therefore, a new thermodynamically consistent model is built for two-phase compressible dilute flows. Pressure in dispersed flow is reintroduced through the use of an equation of state. The mathematical nature of the obtain system for the dispersed phase remains unchanged compared to the pressureless Euler equation, but the compressibility of the dispersed phase is obtained by pressure relaxation terms for which the numerical resolution is simple and efficient. Numerical results are related to one-dimensional simulations of the propagation of a shock wave through a droplet’s cloud and to a multidimensional nozzle flow of a solid rocket motor to show the impact of compressibility on an aluminum liquid droplet’s temperature.",53,8

The present work attempts to examine the capabilities of a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics analysis together with a sediment-tracking algorithm to analyze the evolution of brownout clouds. Both the single-phase and dual-phase flowfields are simulated and compared to available experimental data. The variation of the phenomenological attributes of the cloud evolution as a function of particle size was analyzed and found to agree with experimental evidence. To enable fast single-desktop simulations, all components of this methodology are designed to run on double-precision, programmable graphics processing units. This hybrid implementation uses a multigranular parallel approach to demonstrate significant performance gains over equivalent single-core central processing unit simulations even when computations involve the solution of sparse implicit systems.",53,8

Computations performed for the boundary layer on a natural-laminar-flow airfoil with a leading-edge sweep angle of 34.6 deg, freestream Mach number of 0.75, and chord Reynolds numbers of , , and suggest that discrete roughness elements could delay laminar–turbulent transition by about 20% when transition is caused by stationary crossflow disturbances. Computations show that the introduction of small-wavelength stationary crossflow disturbances (i.e., discrete roughness element) also suppresses the growth of most amplified traveling crossflow disturbances.",53,8
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053719,"This study performs a spatial stability analysis of several jets that have previously been investigated in terms of their noise radiation. The cases include a round jet and two chevron nozzle jets with varying penetration angle. The instability wave evolution in the near-nozzle region is examined to seek for clues as to how and why the mean flow azimuthal inhomogeneity introduced by chevrons modifies the low-frequency noise component. A biglobal stability analysis is performed to determine the most unstable modes on an initial plane. The downstream evolution of the most unstable modes is then computed via three-dimensional parabolized stability equations. The azimuthal mean flow inhomogeneity introduced by chevrons is found to modify instability wave growth rates and phase speeds. Findings indicate that the near-field hydrodynamic pressure oscillations of round jet instability modes are suppressed by chevron jets. For the same modal excitation amplitude at the inlet, the two chevron jets generate considerably lower pressure fluctuations than the round jet. It is also shown that the chevron jet with the lowest hydrodynamic pressure fluctuation levels is the jet with the lowest far-field low-frequency noise output among the three jets.",53,8
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053717,"The presented study examines various methods for phase averaging the naturally oscillating flowfield of a scaled-up fluidic oscillator. No external trigger is employed to control the oscillation of the flow. Mathematical and signal conditioning approaches for phase averaging the data are categorized and described. The results of these methods are evaluated for their accuracy in capturing the natural flowfield. The respective criteria are based on the minimum fluctuation in oscillation period length, the conservation of velocity amplitudes, and the number of snapshots per phase-averaging window. Although all methods produce reasonable qualitative results, only two methods are identified to provide the desired quantitative accuracy and suitability for the investigated flowfield. The first method is based on conditioning a time-resolved pressure signal from the feedback channels in the oscillator. An autocorrelation applied to the reference signal improves the period identification. The second method employs a mathematical approach by means of proper orthogonal decomposition. Because the conventional use of proper orthogonal decomposition reveals shortcomings in quantitative accuracy, it is modified by imposing an even distribution of snapshots per phase angle window. The results demonstrate the feasibility and improved accuracy of the modified proper orthogonal decomposition. Therefore, accurate phase averaging can be conducted without the need for a time-resolved reference signal.",53,8
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053725,"When applying the method of manufactured solutions on computational fluid dynamic software, it is a requirement that all solutions be continuous on the computational domain. This stipulation is limiting for the verification and validation of numerical solutions where discontinuities are frequent. In an effort to adapt the standard method of manufactured solutions procedure, we propose a piecewise approach for modeling solutions with discontinuities. Linearly and quadratically exact transformations are used for determining the exact solutions and source terms for cells split by discontinuities. Upwind manufactured solutions are initialized and a least squares fit is used to solve for solutions downwind of the discontinuity such that the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions are satisfied. The codes used throughout this research are finite volume, 1st and 2nd order, inviscid schemes combined with uniform structured grids. This study shows that a modified method of manufactured solutions procedure can be performed with fully general discontinuous solutions yielding 1st order convergences typically associated with shocks.",53,8

The liner is a simple mass–spring–damper system. The shear flow has a rather thin boundary layer, and the mesh has to be refined close to the walls. The objective is to assess whether an instability can be computed and whether a computed instability is physical. The computations are backed by a linear stability analysis of the flow that is performed by solving a matrix eigenvalue problem. By comparing the results of the simulations of the linearized Euler equations with the results of the stability analysis, it is found that the computed instabilities are physical and that their characteristics can be predicted.
