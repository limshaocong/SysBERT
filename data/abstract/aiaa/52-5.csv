0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052713,"Two driving imperatives of 21st century commercial aviation are improving fuel consumption and reducing environmental impact. The research important to aeropropulsion’s advancing these goals is shaped both by physics of the design space and by design choice. As fuel becomes increasingly more expensive, engine architectures and design details evolve to reflect the new balance between engine fuel consumption, weight, and manufacturing and maintenance costs. The evolution of engine architectures changes the relative value of specific technologies. The engines of the future will be advanced gas turbines due to their superior fuel burn at the aircraft level. They will be fueled by sustainable liquid hydrocarbons. Both the thermal and propulsive efficiency of the gas turbine can be significantly improved. The need to improve propulsive efficiency has driven engine bypass ratio up, to 12 recently, and higher in the future. This is a different, less familiar design space than the 5 to 8 bypass ratio, which characterized the last 40 years of engine experience. Realignment of research priorities is required to address 21st century challenges, such as the knowledge needed to realize efficient engines at very small core sizes. The new challenges open up new opportunities for both designers and researchers.",52,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051849,"Two computationally efficient algorithms are developed for solving the stochastic eigenvalue problem. An algorithm based on the power iteration technique is proposed for the calculation of the dominant eigenpairs. This algorithm is then extended to find other subdominant random eigenpairs. The uncertainty in the operator is represented by a polynomial chaos expansion, and a similar representation is considered for the random eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The algorithms are distinguished due to their speed in converging to the true random eigenpairs and their ability to estimate a prescribed number of subdominant eigenpairs. The algorithms are demonstrated on two examples with close agreement observed with the exact solution and a solution synthesized through Monte Carlo sampling.",52,5
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052185,"Navier–Stokes simulations are performed to determine the responses of a single-degree-of-freedom pitch airfoil system, as well as those of a two-degree-of-freedom pitch-and-heave system, in buffeting flows. The buffeting flow exhibits shock-wave oscillations of a unique frequency that occurs for some combinations of mean flow angle of attack and transonic Mach numbers. It was found that frequency lock-in may occur, when the frequency of the elastic system is close to the buffet frequency, and the amplitude of the elastic oscillation is above some threshold. Following frequency lock-in, the system response rapidly increases until reaching a limit-cycle oscillation. Synchronization of the transonic aerodynamic buffet phenomenon and the structural elastic modes provides a physical mechanism that leads to a limit-cycle oscillation, as observed in the current computational study.",52,5
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052255,"Aeroelastic systems achieve the best performance when the aerodynamic shape and structural sizing are optimized concurrently, but such an optimization is challenging when high-fidelity aerodynamic and structural models are required. This paper addresses this challenge through several significant improvements. Fully coupled Newton–Krylov methods are presented for the solution of aerostructural systems and for the corresponding adjoint systems. The coupled adjoint method presented can compute gradients with respect to thousands of multidisciplinary design variables accurately and efficiently. This is enabled by several improvements in the computation of the multidisciplinary terms in the coupled adjoint. The parallel scalability of the methods is demonstrated for a full aircraft configuration using an Euler computational fluid dynamics model with more than state variables and a detailed structural finite element model of the wing with more than degrees of freedom. The coupled Newton–Krylov methods are shown to improve the convergence rate of both the aerostructural solution and the coupled adjoint derivative computations. Gradient computations of aerodynamic and structural functions with respect to both aerodynamic shape and structural sizing variables are verified, and scaling is demonstrated to variables. The accuracy and scalability of the presented methods make it possible to perform aerostructural optimizations of full aircraft configurations with respect to hundreds of external shape and structural sizing design variables, leading to optimal aeroelastic tailoring.",52,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052312,"In this study, a new model-reduction method based on the fine finite-element model of complicated beam-type structure is presented, which can meet the needs of fast rough estimation of structural global dynamic performances in preliminary design. Based on the knowledge of deformation characteristics of beam-type structures, the plane cross-section assumption and displacement interpolation function of the beam is introduced to construct a localized physical reduction base vector. By dividing the structure into several parts, the finite-element method structural nodal degrees of freedom in each part are projected onto the nodal deflection and rotation degree of freedom of two master nodes at its two ends; the part of the structure is reduced into a super beam element. A free–free reduced super beam model with fewer degrees of freedom than the original complicated one is obtained by assembling the super beam elements in series. The accuracy of the reduced super beam model is further improved by modifying the stiffness matrix of super beam element and considering the effect of shear deformation in a rational way. Several examples for fast frequency and transient analysis of the original structure under different boundary conditions and dynamic load are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.",52,5
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052242,"Structural geometrical nonlinearities strongly affect the response of joined wings: it has been shown that buckling evaluations using linear methods are unreliable, and only a fully nonlinear stability analysis can safely identify the unstable state. This work focuses on the understanding of the main physical mechanisms driving the wing system’s response and the snap-buckling instability. Several counterintuitive effects typical of unconventional nonplanar wing systems are discussed and explained. In particular, an appropriate design of the joint-to-wing connection may reduce the amount of bending moment transferred, and this is shown to eventually improve the stability properties, although at price of a reduced stiffness. It is also demonstrated that the lower-to-upper-wing stiffness ratio and the torsional–bending coupling, due to both the geometrical layout and anisotropy of the composite laminates, present a major impact on the nonlinear response. The findings of this work could provide useful indications to develop effective aeroelastic reduced-order models tailored for airplane configurations experiencing important geometric nonlinearities such as PrandtlPlane, truss-braced and strut-braced wings, and sensorcraft.",52,5
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052305,"The wave drag is an important factor that affects the supersonic flight efficiency and is closely related to the aircraft’s cross-sectional area distribution. A reasonable cross-sectional area distribution determines supersonic aircraft wave drag reduction. In this paper, an exploration of the supersonic aircraft wing–body shape parameterization using the class-shape-refinement-transformation technique and the method of extended far-field composite-element (EFCE) supersonic wing–body wave drag optimization are proposed. The method was applied to a supersonic civil transport wing–body shape optimization, yielding a 40.5% reduction of wave drag coefficient. In this way, the goal of reducing the wave drag in sufficient precision without any lift penalty was achieved. The EFCE wave drag optimization method is available in the conceptual design process of supersonic cruise aircraft to achieve high lift-to-drag ratio characteristics in supersonic flight conditions.",52,5

The measurements were performed for a sinusoidally driven SDBD having amplitudes of 4450 and 5900 V and a frequency of 5000 Hz. The relative number density profiles of and , as a function of voltage, show the difference in discharge structure of the two voltage half-cycles, as well as a transition in discharge structure during the negative voltage half-cycle. The transition in discharge structure was also evident in the results. The transition in discharge structure occurred by increasing the applied voltage, resulting in the presence of weak and strong tufts at 4450 and 5900 V, respectively. In particular, the presence of strong tufts resulted in a localized enhancement in the production of by a factor of 6 and in by a factor of 1.8, as well as an increase in the by a factor of 1.6, within the electrode gap.",52,5
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052419,"Numerical and experimental analysis of a synthetic jet actuator in quiescent air is reported. The study focuses on the actuator itself and on the vorticity field as well as on structures that are generated by the actuator. Large eddies simulation was used for numerical analysis and phase-locked, two-dimensional microscopic-particle image velocimetry technique was used in the experiment. In the numerical simulation, the equations were integrated using a nondissipative scheme that enforces discrete conservation of kinetic energy. The internal cavity flow of the actuator was part of the simulation. The actuator under consideration is of a unique design, fabricated to accommodate practical issues associated with helicopter rotor application. However, it has the same operating principles as a conventional synthetic jet actuator. Harmonics of the forcing frequency were traced in the velocity field. Insight into the evolution of the vortical structures, jet flapping, and onset of turbulence in the jet was retrieved. This is an important building block for better understanding of the interaction of synthetic jets with boundary layers.",52,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052414,"High-dimensional design-optimization problems involving complex and time-consuming solvers present computational challenges and are expensive to execute. Even though surrogate models can replace these expensive problems with simpler models, the initial design of experiment for constructing these models effectively is still exponential to the dimension of the problem. Traditional screening methods in optimization reduce the dimension of the problem by discarding variables, which is undesirable. In this paper, a latent variable model called generative topographic mapping is proposed to reduce the dimension of the problem so as to facilitate an optimization search in a low-dimensional space without removing any variables from the design problem. The method works by transforming high-dimensional data to be embedded on a low-dimensional manifold. It is demonstrated on a two-dimensional Branin function subjected to nonlinear constraints and then applied to real engineering constrained optimization problems of an aircraft wing design and an aircraft compressor rotor. The model developed in this work proved to be more effective in dealing with constrained optimization problems by effectively learning the constraint boundary, hence finding feasible best designs when compared to other surrogate models like kriging.",52,5
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052472,"High- field combustion, such as in rotary ramjet engines, is a promising approach to reduce nitride oxides and combustor size by taking advantage of the flame acceleration due to the buoyancy of the products over the reactants. This paper presents a high- field combustor design for a rim–rotor rotary ramjet engine. In this device, a premixed flow of air and fuel is ignited in the nonrotating inlet track and then swallowed and stabilized in the rotating combustion chamber. Outboard ignition frees the rotating structure from igniters, increasing the maximal tangential speed of the engine and thus its maximal efficiency. The rotating combustor design benefits from extreme centrifugal fields ( to ) for both stabilizing the flame during ignition and maximize flame velocity. A simple buoyancy-driven combustion model allows estimating the combustor length and shows good agreement with numerical simulations, which demonstrate a combustion efficiency to be higher than 85%, even with some reactants bypassing the flameholder. Experiments demonstrate ignition at tangential speeds from 250 to , combustion efficiency from 60 to 75% up to a centrifugal acceleration of , and positive indicated power.",52,5
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052370,"Even though many technical applications feature multiple jets in crossflow, little attention has been paid so far to their simultaneous numerical simulation as a system. A special challenge in this context is the simulation of exhausts of air systems on aircraft since they feature multiple hot jets in crossflow at high Reynolds numbers. As standard statistical turbulence models are not capable of correctly predicting thermal mixing between the jet and crossflow as well as interjet mixing, the scale-adaptive simulation is employed. In a first step, a simplified configuration comprising five laterally aligned jets is investigated, and numerical results are compared to wind tunnel data with good agreement. The establishing flowfield is analyzed, and its dynamics are compared to a single jet in the crossflow reference case. In a second step, the exhaust of an existing antiicing system is considered on an aircraft under realistic flight conditions. To take into account the local flow topology and to reduce computational costs, a sequential simulation methodology is applied, which relies on a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulation of the aircraft to provide boundary conditions for a subsequent scale-adaptive simulation calculation in a truncated subdomain. Results are compared to flight test data with good agreement, which highlights the applicability of the proposed approach.",52,5
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052644,"In this paper, force and particle-image-velocimetry vorticity measurements of biologically inspired hover kinematics are compared to corresponding results of an unsteady aerodynamic vortex model and a Navier–Stokes (NS) solver. The Reynolds number and the reduced frequency are and 0.38, respectively. Three kinematics derived from the measured hovering kinematics of an Agrius convolvuli are considered: 1) without elevation angle, 2) elevation angle accounted in the pitch angle, and 3) pure sinusoidal pitch–plunge neglecting higher harmonics. The Navier–Stokes computations show good qualitative agreement with experiments with consistent underprediction. The time-averaged thrust coefficients obtained using Navier–Stokes computations are 82 to 87% of the corresponding force measurements. The standard deviation of time history of thrust coefficients, also normalized by the measured time-averaged values, is 13 to 20%. The underprediction is possibly due to blockage effects in the experiments, also reflected in lower values of the vorticity compared to particle-image-velocimetry measurements. The unsteady aerodynamic vortex model captures some of the peaks in a qualitative manner. The relative difference in the time-averaged forces and standard deviation are 8 to 18% and 66 to 93%, respectively. The differences in prediction of time histories are not reflected in the estimation of time-averaged forces due to cancellation effects, wherein the forces are underpredicted in the first half of the stroke and overpredicted in the second half. The discrepancies are attributed to the simplifying assumptions in the unsteady aerodynamic vortex model, which overpredicts the vorticity in the leading-edge vortex and results in significant differences in the wing–wake interaction process.",52,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052529,"A computational model has been implemented that is capable of accurately predicting the flow patterns around a vortex generator. The aim in development was the resolution of small-scale flow features. By observing the progression of the vortex structure along the wing, the causes of flow separation could be ascertained. It was found that flow separation occurred when the vortex structure produced by the generators broke down. This caused a localized flow separation that, at high angles, extended to cause globalized separation and generator engulfment. The computational fluid dynamics model was tested with a wind tunnel model and found to accurately describe the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing in the unstalled and lightly stalled condition. It was found that the severity of stall, experienced by wings fitted with ramp-type vortex generators, is largely due to a feedback loop mechanism that is created by the flow being drawn through the generators by attached trailing flows. An additional consequence of this was the increase in sensitivity to Reynolds number of the wing, resulting from the addition of vortex generators. Results indicate that the knowledge of these effects could be successfully applied to other wing profiles and designs.",52,5
