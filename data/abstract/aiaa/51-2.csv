0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J050337,"In this paper, the problem of reliability analysis under both aleatory uncertainty (natural variability) and epistemic uncertainty (arising when the only knowledge about the random variables is sparse-point data) is addressed. First considered is epistemic uncertainty arising from a lack of knowledge of the distribution type of the random variables. To address this uncertainty in distribution type, the use of a flexible family of distributions is proposed. The Johnson family of distributions has the ability to reproduce the shape of many named continuous probability distributions and therefore alleviate the difficulty of determining an appropriate named distribution type for the random variable. Next considered is uncertainty in the distribution parameters themselves, and methods to determine probability distributions for the distribution parameters are proposed. As a result, the uncertainty in reliability estimates for limit-state functions having random variables with imprecise probability distributions as their arguments is computed. An optimization-based approach for computing the bounds on the reliability of a design that allows for the decoupling of epistemic and aleatory uncertainty analysis is proposed, enabling computationally affordable approaches to reliability analysis under aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. The proposed methods are illustrated for two problems of uncertainty quantification in the performance of hypersonic aerospace vehicles.",51,2

Two flow regimes are observed, and these are shown to affect the radiated sound. An overall sound reduction at an observer directly above the cylinder is observed for a small gap distance between the cylinder and the plate (, in which is the cylinder height), where a 2.9 dB reduction in the sound-pressure level is obtained when there is no gap between the two bodies. In contrast, the emitted sound-pressure level increases by at least 8.0 dB for large gap distances . Despite this, a 6.3 dB reduction in the sound-pressure level is obtained due to a sound-cancellation mechanism when the plate length is reduced to and placed downstream of the cylinder. The maximum sound reduction attainable is shown to be limited by the nonlinear unsteady stall process on the plate.",51,2
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051485,"The solid-rocket plumes from the abort motor of the multipurpose crew vehicle were simulated using hot, high-pressure, helium gas to determine pressure fluctuations on the vehicle surface in the event of an abort. About 80 different abort situations over a Mach number range of 0.3 to 1.2, and vehicle attitudes of , were simulated using a 6% scaled model inside the NASA Ames Transonic Wind Tunnel. The test showed very high level of surface pressure fluctuations caused by the hydrodynamic near-field of the plume shear layer. The plumes grew in size with increasing flight Mach number, which was associated with a lowering of the ambient pressure. This caused an increase of plume impingement on the vehicle. Interestingly, the trend was a decrease in the level of pressure fluctuations with increasing impingement. The wind-tunnel data were compared against flight data from the Pad Abort 1 flight test. Despite various differences between the transient-flight situation and the steady-state wind-tunnel simulations, the hot-helium data were found to replicate Pad Abort 1 fairly reasonably. The data gathered from this one-of-a-kind wind-tunnel test fills a gap in the manned-space programs, and will be used to establish the acoustic environment for vibro-acoustic qualification of the multipurpose crew vehicle.",51,2
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051593,"A combined numerical and experimental study of two- and three-dimensional pitching and plunging flat plates at Reynolds numbers of is presented. The focus of this paper is the interplay between the geometry, kinematics, Reynolds numbers, and three-dimensional effects with the resulting aerodynamic forces and flow structures. A shallow-stall and a deep-stall motion with higher maximum effective angles of attacks are considered. Under both kinematic motions, massive leading-edge separation is observed at the sharp leading edge of the flat plate. This geometric effect is seen to dominate over other viscosity effects, and the Reynolds number dependence is limited. Compared with the blunter SD7003 airfoil, where the flow is mostly attached for the shallow-stall motion at , the sharper leading edge of the flat plate leads to earlier and stronger leading-edge vortex formation and greater lift and drag. Finally, the presence of a tip vortex significantly reduces lift generation during the downstroke of an aspect ratio 2 flat plate undergoing the shallow-stall motion. During the upstroke, the tip vortex is weaker and the force on the aspect ratio 2 wing can be approximated by its two-dimensional counterpart.",51,2
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051697,"Robust linear control, combined with model-reduction methodologies, is investigated for gust rejection on large, very flexible aircraft using trailing-edge control surfaces. Controllers are designed on linearizations of the nonlinear aeroelastic equations, and the closed-loop response of both the linearized and nonlinear system to discrete gust distributions is compared to the open-loop dynamics. Results show that an controller performs well on a relatively large linearized system, with 9% load alleviation in root bending moments for the critical gust length. When applied to the nonlinear model of the same vehicle, the robust controller gives a good performance in response to short gusts, including the critical length, with even better load reductions than the linear case. However, this performance gap decreases as the gust length is increased. It is also shown how standard model-reduction techniques can provide metrics for the selection of a minimum size of the aeroelastic system. Finally, it is shown that both the full and reduced controllers are capable of stabilizing a large-amplitude phugoid mode on the nonlinear model of the vehicle.",51,2
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051781,"A computational code has been developed for aeroelastic analysis for an all-movable horizontal tail, and a companion wind-tunnel test program has been conducted. The structural bending and torsional stiffness are based upon an experimental tail model that has served as the basis for free-play design criteria. A linear three-dimensional time-domain vortex-lattice aerodynamic model is used to study the flutter and also nonlinear limit-cycle oscillations induced by a free-play gap in the actuating mechanism at the root of the tail as well as the effects of the root rotation angle (nominal angle of attack) on limit-cycle-oscillation response and gravity loads. It is found that the root rotation angle, gravity loads, and the initial conditions all significantly affect the limit-cycle-oscillation behavior. The computed aeroelastic responses are compared with the experimental data.",51,2
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051771,"In many situations, it is either impossible to perform a spacecraft system level vibration test, or it is highly desirable to avoid one to conserve time and resources. If modeling and analysis are to replace system tests, it is imperative to have confidence in the results. Therefore, a probabilistic system correlation analysis must be performed by quantifying uncertainty in the substructures, and then propagating it into the system correlation metrics. A systematic procedure is presented for studying the effects of substructure uncertainty on system test-analysis correlation of spacecraft that are validated on a substructure-by-substructure basis. Covariance propagation is used to propagate uncertainty in a free-interface substructure frequency response into the expected frequency response uncertainty for the system using a component mode synthesis approach. The frequency response-based procedure is of special interest in systems with high-modal density, where modal correlation methods do not work. A simple two-substructure example is investigated, and the results of the proposed procedure are substantiated using a full system Monte Carlo analysis. The approach presented is very fast, compared with the Monte Carlo techniques, and it propagates uncertainty in the substructure frequency response directly into the system results.",51,2
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051793,"Dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators generate a net response force that exhibits potential for thrust applications such as propulsive systems. In this work, an angled actuator in which the exposed and encased electrodes are not parallel has been investigated using direct force measurements and particle image velocimetry. It was shown that the induced force was nonlinearly increased by increasing the angle between the electrodes. In addition, the direction of the upstream component of the ionic wind was changed by varying the electrode angle. Modifying the angle between the electrodes changes the electric field strength in the vicinity of the plasma actuator, thereby changing the response force produced. Analytical calculations were used to compare expected results with results obtained experimentally. Then, using the results obtained experimentally, a plasma thruster was designed as proof of concept for dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators as propulsive devices.",51,2
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051800,"This paper presents a method of large-eddy simulation on unstructured grids designed to predict the wall heat transfer in typical aeronautical applications featuring turbulent flows and complex geometries. Two types of wall treatments are considered: a wall-function model using a full tetrahedral grid and a wall-resolved method computed on a hybrid tetrahedral–prismatic grid. These two approaches are tested against the square-cylinder case at moderate Reynolds number , in which many reference data are available for flow dynamics and heat transfer. Both predict accurately the unsteady flow around the cylinder and in its near wake, but only the wall-resolved approach reproduces the Nusselt-number global value and its spatial distribution around the cylinder wall. This latter method is used to investigate the coupling between periodic vortex shedding and wall heat transfer using a phase-averaged analysis.",51,2
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051806,"An extensive study on a microactuator that can generate high-momentum, high-frequency perturbations over a large bandwidth is presented in this paper. Such an actuator can potentially be used for the active control of various shear and boundary-layer flows that involve separation, mixing, and noise generation. The resonance enhanced microjet actuator described in this paper is a simple microfluidic system consisting of an underexpanded source jet flowing into a specially configured cavity integrated with multiple micronozzles, through which unsteady pulsed supersonic jets issue. The resonance frequency of these microjets could be varied over a large range (approximately 1–60 kHz) by changing the geometric and flow parameters of the microactuator system. Mean and unsteady properties of the microactuator are examined, including time-resolved flow visualizations and synchronous pressure and noise measurements; collectively, they provide a better understanding of the actuator dynamics. The present study also explores the design space and performance, as well as some of the design limitations of this actuator. Based on this parametric, a correlation is suggested that may be used for designing such actuators for various applications.",51,2
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051791,"A novel fluidic oscillator, particularly suitable to serve as the key element in actuators for control of fluid flows, was proposed and experimentally investigated. Its core part, as in known oscillators, is a fluidic bistable jet-deflection diverter amplifier. The unique feature of the new layout is the absence of the closed feedback loop channels. Instead, there is a quarter-wave Helmholtz resonator tube connected to one of the amplifier control terminals. The acoustic waves traveling in it and reflected from its open end cause the phase-delayed switching of the amplifier. The main advantage is high achievable oscillation frequency and no dependence on the flow rate.",51,2
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051819,"A theoretical modeling approach is proposed for noise radiated from aeroelastic skin plates of aircraft fuselage stiffened by orthogonally distributed rib-stiffeners and subjected to external jet-noise in the presence of mean flow. The focus is placed upon quantifying the effects of mean flow on the aeroelastic-acoustic characteristics of the rib-stiffened plate. The Euler–Bernoulli beam equation and the torsional wave equation governing separately the flexural and torsional motions of the rib-stiffeners are employed to accurately describe the force-moment coupling between the stiffeners and the plate. Given the periodicity of the structure, the resulting governing equations of the system are solved by applying the Poisson summation formula and the Fourier transformation technique. The radiated sound pressure is related to the plate displacement by means of the Helmholtz equation and the fluid-structure boundary conditions. To highlight the radiation characteristics of the periodically stiffened structure as well as the mean flow effects, the final radiated sound pressure is presented in the form of decibels with reference to that of a bare plate immersed in mean flow. Systematic parametric studies are conducted to evaluate the effects of external mean flow speed, noise incident angle and periodical spacings on the aeroelastic-acoustic performance of the rib-stiffened plate.",51,2
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051825,"This investigation identifies and characterizes the changes in the near wake of a bluff body produced by boundary-layer thickening, which, in turn, result in an overall reduction in the base drag. For this study, wedge and flat-plate models with both smooth and rough forebody surfaces were used. The forebody surface roughness on both models was increased to modify/thicken the forebody boundary layer. Hot-wire surveys were carried out to characterize the boundary-layer state ahead of the separation point, and base-pressure measurements were used to quantify base-drag reduction associated with boundary-layer modification. In addition, particle image velocimetry measurements in the near wake were performed for both models, and proper orthogonal decomposition analysis was used to analyze the velocity data. Low-order near-wake velocity reconstructions obtained from proper orthogonal decomposition analysis accurately represented the near-wake behavior for the studied cases. It was observed from these low-order reconstructions that the shed vortices became more organized, convected faster, and decreased in strength when the boundary layer was thickened/modified. These changes in the wake behavior resulted in an increase in base pressure and an overall decrease in the base drag.",51,2
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051803,"A new approach to bounding effective properties of random heterogeneous materials is developed in this paper. The expectation material properties are computed for a stochastic unit cell to represent the random heterogeneous materials. This stochastic unit cell is then used to compute the upper bound and lower bound of effective properties using the variational asymptotic method for unit cell homogenization, a recently developed general-purpose micromechanics code. In comparison with other approaches, the present approach has two main advantages. 1) The numerical implementation is not restricted to statically homogeneous and isotropic microstructures. 2) Both the lower bound and upper bound converge to the effective properties of a deterministic unit cell with decreasing randomness of the stochastic unit cell. To illustrate the application of this new approach, various examples are analyzed and compared with existing theories.",51,2
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051842,"In the present study, performance characteristics of a high altitude test facility for testing large area ratio rocket engines have been investigated. Steady-state numerical simulations have been performed initially to highlight the effects of operational parameters on a high altitude test facility operation. Later, the performance of the test facility during the startup phase of the rocket motor has been analyzed. The predicted results show that during the initial high altitude test facility evacuation, the desired vacuum level is attained when the primary jet flow attaches to the ejector duct walls smoothly, thereby arresting any back flow. However, at the fully started condition of the motor, the self-ejector action of the rocket plume plays a major role in maintaining the desired vacuum condition and, hence, the ejector flow rate can be reduced significantly. The injection of water as a fine spray cools the hot gas to a sufficiently low temperature prior to its release into the atmosphere. The transient predictions capture dynamic phenomena, such as the initial back flow of exhaust gas, and the attainment of self-ejection capability by rocket exhaust in the later stage. The predicted results compare well with in-house experimental data measured during cold and hot flow tests.",51,2
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051847,"In this article, a first-order moment method and a kriging surrogate model are used for optimizations under uncertainty applied to two-bar truss designs and two-dimensional lift-constrained drag minimizations. Given uncertainties in statistically independent, random, normally distributed input variables, the two approaches are used to propagate these uncertainties through the mathematical model and to approximate output statistics of interest. To assess the validity of the approximations, the results are compared with full Monte Carlo simulations. When using first-order moment methods for robust optimizations, first-order sensitivity derivatives appear in the objective function and system constraints. Therefore, second-order sensitivity derivatives are needed for gradient-based optimization approaches. When the kriging surrogate model is used to calculate the objective function value and system constraints, it will be shown that a gradient predictor for the kriging model can be successfully used for gradient-based optimizations. Both the kriging and first-order moment method approaches enable predictions of the mean and variance of quantities of interest while at the same time keeping the computational cost for optimization under uncertainty problems manageable. The novelty of this article is the use of a kriging surrogate model for uncertainty propagation in a gradient-based robust optimization framework.",51,2
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051852,"Streamwise oriented Dielectric-Barrier-Discharge plasma actuators were used on a NACA 4418 airfoil for flow separation control at and 95 k. Rows of symmetric and asymmetric actuators were located on the fore section of the suction surface, which were designed to create counterrotating and corotating streamwise vortex arrays, respectively. These could completely reattach the flow in the downstream of the actuators for at , and for at . The drag coefficient was reduced by 63% at and the lift coefficient increased by 67%, while the symmetric actuators performed slightly better than the asymmetric actuators overall. Streamwise vortices appeared to play a key role at low angles of attack, although the flow reattachment is believed to be primarily due to a strong suction into the plasma. Furthermore, these streamwise actuators outperformed a pair of spanwise actuators over the same chord-wise locations.",51,2
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051840,"The Unified Theory of Roughness Noise is examined for the first time by making predictions of far-field noise normalized on the single-point rough wall pressure spectrum for a 40 grit stochastic sandpaper roughness and a 1-mm hemispherical element deterministic roughness with conditions ranging from transitionally to fully rough. These predictions are compared to experimentally measured values of noise from these surfaces in a wall-jet flow. Predicted values are within approximately 6 dB of the measured noise from the stochastic and deterministic roughness showing that reliable predictions of roughness noise can be completed using the Unified Theory for even fully rough conditions, as long as the roughness height to boundary-layer thicknesses are relatively moderate. The spectral shape of normalized roughness noise was found to be a predictable function of the relationship between the roughness geometry and the wall pressure wavenumber-frequency spectrum. The effect of the form of the wall pressure wavenumber-frequency spectrum on the predicted noise spectra was investigated finding that the convective velocity is the most significant parameter affecting the quality of predictions.",51,2
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051867,"Hypersonic testing in impulse facilities replicates various flow characteristics accurately; however, because of the short test times, some phenomena cannot be fully simulated. Previous testing has been conducted with preheated walls up to 800 K; however, this falls well short of the typical temperatures characteristic of ablators in hypervelocity reentry (~2000–3000 K). The concept presented here is to use resistive heating on a carbon–carbon model to preheat the model immediately before conducting a test. This method has enabled testing at wall temperatures in excess of 2000 K in the X2 expansion tube at the University of Queensland. The model used was a short half-cylinder with a diameter-to-length ratio of 4.5 and was tested in a Earth-entry flow monitored by ultraviolet spectrometry. The testing campaign showed that there was a significant increase in the cyanogen formation off the surface of the model when it was heated to 2000 K. This testing demonstrates the viability of the presented method, which will enable a new range of testing to be conducted in impulse facilities with emphasis on hypervelocity flows, in particular those in which the real flight vehicle uses a carbon-based ablator as the thermal protection system.",51,2
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051885,"The linear dynamic elasticity problem formulation and solution for a generally asymmetric sandwich beam/wide plate consisting of orthotropic core and face sheets subjected to blast loading is presented. The Laplace transform is used to obtain ordinary differential equations in the complex Laplace space (the variable being the through-thickness coordinate), which are subsequently solved in closed form for a simply supported beam. The time response is then obtained by a numerical inverse Laplace transform by using the Euler method. The results for realistic material and blast cases for the transient displacements and face sheet/core interfacial transverse normal and shear stresses are presented. A comparison of the elasticity results is also made with first-order shear and high-order sandwich panel theories. This solution can be used as a benchmark in assessing the accuracy of advanced sandwich panel theories.",51,2
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051845,"This paper presents a method for concurrent mesh and polynomial-order adaptation with the objective of direct minimization of output error using a selection process for choosing the optimal refinement option from a discrete set of choices that includes directional spatial resolution and approximation order increment. The scheme is geared toward compressible viscous aerodynamic flows, in which various solution features make certain refinement options more efficient than others. No attempt is made, however, to measure the solution anisotropy or smoothness directly or to incorporate it into the scheme. Rather, mesh anisotropy and approximation order distribution arise naturally from the optimization of a merit function that incorporates both an output sensitivity and a measure of solution cost on the new mesh. The method is applied to output-based adaptive simulations of laminar and Reynolds-averaged compressible Navier-Stokes equations on body-fitted meshes in two and three dimensions. Two-dimensional results show significant reductions in the degrees of freedom and computational time to achieve output convergence when discrete choice optimization is used compared to uniform or refinement. Three-dimensional results show that the presented method is an affordable way of achieving output convergence on difficult cases such as the third AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop W1 configuration.",51,2
