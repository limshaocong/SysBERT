0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057737,"This paper reports a study aiming at improving the flight quality and aerodynamic performance of a robotic hummingbird. The first part of the paper addresses the issue of the parasitic roll and pitch bias moments resulting from the small asymmetry (left/right and front/back) in the wing trajectory. This is achieved with a new string-based mechanism that reduces by 90% the asymmetry associated with the previous mechanism of our robot (known as COLIBRI). The second part of the paper aims at increasing the lift and reducing the mechanical power. An experimental study is conducted with leading edge bars of various diameters and it is found that wing flexibility may contribute to smooth the transition at wing reversal (less twisting oscillations) and leads to a significant increase of the lift force and a significant reduction of the mechanical power. As a side effect, the wing compliance contributes to reducing the noise in the inertial sensor and the acoustic noise produced by the flying robot.",57,11
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057646,"The flow over a flat-plate wing passing through a transverse gust was investigated using both experimental and computational methods. The gust created physically in a water-filled towing tank was found to have a sine-squared velocity profile and was modeled as such in the computations. The physical gust system was designed so that the gust velocity could be varied, thereby allowing for independent variation of the Reynolds number and gust ratio. Dynamically scaled numerical simulations of the physical flow were performed using a three-dimensional Navier–Stokes solver, where the field velocity method with the source term was implemented to simulate the gust. Küssner’s function was also used with Duhamel superposition to find the analytical lift response of a flat plate for the aforementioned transverse velocity profile for comparison with experimental and numerical results. During the gust encounter, forces were found to increase significantly relative to the steady values but fully recovered after the wing exited the gust. The measured forces on the wing were found to scale with the exposed projected area of the wing. Computational forces broadly agreed with experimental and analytical data, and it was shown that the proposed numerical method captures the force trends observed in this transient flow.",57,11
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058379,"A recently proposed aerodynamic force theory of compressible high-Reynolds-number flows based on the concept of vortex force is here analyzed. The aerodynamic force is obtained by means of volume and surface integrals within the flow. The theory proposes the decomposition of the aerodynamic force, both lift and drag components, in reversible and irreversible contributions. The former is responsible for the lift and lift-induced drag, and the latter for the viscous and wave drag components. The analysis is here concentrated on the following aspects: 1) link with traditional drag breakdown methods and sensitivity of the force decomposition to the choice of the integration domain, 2) analysis in the limit of inviscid flow, and 3) effects of the Reynolds number. The verification of the analysis is obtained postprocessing viscous and inviscid numerical solutions around airfoils and wings.",57,11

Because the design of the airfoil sections is a multidisciplinary field, involving several aerodynamic and structural parameters, the Simulated Annealing algorithm was used to design the optimized shape of the flatback airfoil sections. Computational fluid dynamics calculations in the optimization process were performed using the commercial Fluent code. The design Reynolds number was and the optimized airfoil sections have 35, 40, 45, and 50% maximum thickness with a trailing edge gap ranging from 12.5 up to 20.0%. The wind tunnel test was performed on the HB-FB-350-150 airfoil at a Reynolds number of . The results show that the optimized flatback airfoils have several benefits compared with currently applied flatback airfoils. The results for these new optimized flatback airfoils are mainly a higher lift coefficient, higher stall angle of attack, higher sectional moment of inertia, and lower sensitivity to leading edge roughness compared with the current flatback airfoils.",57,11

The present study develops a supercritical airfoil optimization design method that takes into account the ice-accretion effects. A multipoint/multiobjective aerodynamic optimization tool based on a response surface-enhanced evolutionary algorithm and a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes analysis is constructed. A modified shear stress transport turbulence model is developed for predicting the stall behavior of an airfoil with a non-streamline leading-edge caused by horn-shaped ice. The aerodynamic coefficients of the design points at high-speed/low-speed/ice-accretion situations are set as the collaborative objectives. Pressure distribution constraints are applied to assure favorable pressure distribution, and they better coordinate these objectives. The results show that the present optimization improves the maximum lift coefficient of an iced airfoil by 16.5% while maintaining the cruise aerodynamic efficiency as well as its robustness. The selection of design objectives is discussed to achieve better design quality and efficiency. The optimized airfoil is analyzed with different ice shapes as well as icing conditions, and it is applied on a wing, which validates the improvement of aerodynamic performance.",57,11

The focus was on understanding the mechanisms for separation reduction and lift enhancement due to the application of the flow control. Activating all the jets resulted in up to increase in the sectional lift, which was measured via an array of surface-mounted pressure ports. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry revealed the presence of trains of pinched, skewed vortical rings that were created by the synthetic jets and that caused flow reattachment over the control surface. The characteristics of the train of these vortical rings varied with the spacing between active jets, where smaller spacing resulted in the largest modification to the flow field. The proposed mechanisms for separation reduction in a swept cross flow via pinched vortex rings are discussed, revealing further potential for how to leverage synthetic jets for separation postponement and lift enhancement over control surfaces.",57,11
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058313,"Accurate and efficient prediction of separated transitional flows is always a big challenge for computational fluid dynamics (CFD), especially in engineering applications. The recently proposed multiple hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation (HRLES) versions (such as DDES, SAS, and LDKM) of the transition model have shown good performance for such flows. But in terms of computational costs, they are still not saving enough. This is mainly because the above closures are driven by nine partial differential equations (PDEs) for a three-dimensional flow. Along with this, a novel hybrid closure is proposed that combines the SA model with BC algebraic transition function and the WALE subgrid model. It only consists of six PDEs and requires less than 30% CPU time per iteration as compared with the aforementioned counterparts. After calibration and basic validation for widely used zero pressure gradient flat plate, decaying isotropic turbulence test cases, and semi-infinite S809 wing, the new hybrid closure is applied to the flow over a circular cylinder from to . The mean drag results are well in line with the HRLES versions of model, but with less computational costs. More detailed simulations are also implemented for the circular cylinder at and rod-airfoil configuration at . The results further indicate that the new closure can capture the physics associated with the mean and fluctuating velocity of shedding vortex, frequency, and power spectral of vortex-induced noise.",57,11

After an assessment of accuracy by comparison with experimental data, mechanisms in the Reynolds-stress transport equation, including production, diffusion, strain, and dissipation are examined. In the upstream boundary layer, these quantities are validated with high confidence against published results from the literature. Concerning the SBLI region, all Reynolds stresses exhibit significant growth, consistent with the enhancement of turbulence in adverse pressure gradients. Of particular note is the pressure strain term, which plays a key role in energy redistribution from to and . The pressure diffusion term, commonly assumed to be negligible or combined with turbulent diffusion in Reynolds-stress models, becomes larger than the production and pressure strain terms in the region where the impinging shock crosses the shear layer above the separation bubble. Power spectra of in this region show links to shear layer flapping and Kelvin–Helmholtz-type instability. In the vicinity of the growth in pressure diffusion, turbulent mass flux also exhibits amplification. Critically, in the budget, pressure diffusion and turbulent mass flux behavior for suggests that there may be a benefit in considering the terms individually in modeling efforts.",57,11

Mach 6 wind tunnel facility at NASA Langley Research Center to investigate unsteadiness in turbulent and transitional shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions at Mach 4.2 edge conditions over a range of Reynolds numbers between and . Separation shock unsteadiness in the transitional interactions was found to exhibit probability density functions with a 50% greater range of streamwise unsteadiness than turbulent interactions, and the mean location of the forward lambda-shock position was found to increase by roughly 25% for the lowest Reynolds number transitional test case compared to the turbulent interactions. Power spectra generated using the dynamic shock position data showed that the energy peak of a representative transitional interaction was shifted toward higher frequencies compared to a turbulent test case. Furthermore, while no obvious trend could be detected when the interaction Strouhal number was plotted vs the Reynolds number, two-dimensional Strouhal number fields were found to be significantly different for transitional interactions compared to turbulent interactions. For a representative test case, it was demonstrated that for a transitional interaction the Strouhal numbers associated with large-scale shock unsteadiness were present in an area roughly four times larger than for a turbulent interaction.",57,11

A portable FLEET system that uses a single laser for production of tracers and a single camera for tracking their motion in real time has been developed and deployed. The system performance for high-speed velocimetry in unseeded nitrogen flow has been evaluated at the AEDC Hypervelocity Wind Tunnel 9. Instantaneous velocity measurements at 1 kHz repetition rate were performed during 21 tunnel runs at Mach 10 and 14, both in freestream and in a turbulent boundary layer. The freestream velocities measured with FLEET displayed excellent agreement with the velocities computed using the standard Tunnel 9 data reduction methodology. The turbulent boundary-layer velocity profiles measured with FLEET also showed good agreement with PIV measurements and boundary-layer computational modeling.",57,11
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058290,"The existing database of transition measurements in hypersonic ground facilities has established that, as the nose-tip bluntness is increased, the onset of boundary-layer transition over a circular cone at zero angle of attack shifts downstream. However, this downstream movement in transition slows down and eventually reverses at sufficiently large values of the nose Reynolds number. Because modal amplification is too weak to initiate the measured frustum transition at moderate to large bluntness values, nonmodal growth is investigated as the potential basis for a physics-based model. The present analysis investigates the nonmodal growth of traveling disturbances initiated within the nose-tip vicinity. Results show that both planar and oblique traveling disturbances that peak within the entropy layer experience appreciable energy amplification for successively higher disturbance frequencies as the nose bluntness is increased. For relatively small bluntness values, the initial nonmodal growth is followed by a partial decay that is overcome by an eventual, modal growth as Mack-mode waves. For larger bluntness values, the Mack-mode waves are not amplified anywhere upstream of the experimentally measured transition location, but the traveling waves still undergo a significant amount of nonmodal growth. These findings do not provide a definitive link between optimal growth and the onset of frustum transition on moderately blunt cones, but they are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations of an initial peak near the nose tip followed by a decay and growth in disturbance energy, as well as the appearance of inclined structures above the boundary-layer edge.",57,11

The formulation is based on the idea that KF-induced dissipative fluxes may lead to the generation of unstable modes in the boundary layer. Fedorov and Tumin (“Receptivity of High-Speed Boundary Layers to Kinetic Fluctuations,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 55, No. 7, 2017, pp. 2335–2348) solved the receptivity problem using an asymptotic matching approach, which used a resonant inner solution in the vicinity of the neutral point. This study adopts a method of multiple scales approach, which requires fewer assumptions about the locus of primary excitation. The approach is modeled after the one taken by Luchini (“Receptivity to Thermal Noise of the Boundary Layer over a Swept Wing,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 55, No. 1, 2017, pp. 121–130) to study low-speed incompressible boundary layers over a swept wing.

12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058391,Dual-mode operation and mode transition are experimentally investigated in optical axisymmetric scramjets in Mach 4.5 flows. The axisymmetric scramjet emphasizes generic combustion and flameholding dynamics without the corner boundary-layer effects that can distort flame propagation in rectangular geometries. Flow and combustion dynamics are characterized by pressure transducers distributed along the combustor and heat flux measurements at the combustor exit. Flame structures are resolved by instantaneous OH planar laser-induced fluorescence and high-speed flame chemiluminescence imaging. The initiation of combustion mode transition depends on the amount of heat addition in relation to the area relief along the flowpath. Mixing enhancement by a cavity enables significant combustion heat addition into the core flow such that thermal choking can be attained in the diverging combustor. Thermal choking initiates at the pressure inflection point where the effects of combustion heat loading and area relief are comparable in the diverging combustor. A steady ramjet combustion is established in flow regions upstream of the diverging combustor after scram-to-ram mode transition and the flow reaccelerates to supersonic speed after the cavity ramp.,57,11
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057908,"Numerical simulations are presented to compare the heat addition, thermodynamic cycle, and mixing efficiency of generic uniform- and nonuniform-compression scramjets. The work builds on previous numerical studies that showed the coupling of nonuniform-inlet compression and thermal compression enhanced the performance of low-inlet compression scramjets. In line with previous work, both engines have the same inlet-fuelling method, inlet contraction ratio, and combustor geometry. The freestream corresponds to a Mach 10 flight condition with a dynamic pressure of 100 kPa. This study shows the mixing, heat addition, and thermodynamic cycle efficiency in the nonuniform-compression engine are higher than the uniform-compression engine. The mixing and heat release efficiency increase by 10 and 20% respectively. Enhancement of these performance parameters in the nonuniform-compression engine is caused by a staged-combustion process. This study offers new insight into how purposely induced nonuniform compression can be used to enhance scramjet engine performance.",57,11

The chemical vapor deposition and thermal chemical ablation processes of pyrolysis gas and fuel gas in the porous structure of a carbonized layer and the erosion process of a fuel gas and particles on a carbonized layer were studied. A thermal–mechanical coupled ablation model of ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) based on the complex physicochemical process of the porous structure of a carbonized layer was established. An Arrhenius formula was used to calculate the carbon deposition and consumption caused by thermochemical reactions and the porosity evolution in the carbon layer. Based on the theory of elastic–plastic indentation fracture, a particle erosion model of the carbon layer was established. The coupling of particle erosion and chemical erosion was completed and applied to the EPDM insulation prediction. The numerical calculation of an EPDM insulation material showed that the maximum error between the experimental results and the numerical results is less than 12%, and the accuracy of the particle erosion model is acceptable. Therefore, the model proposed can be used to predict the erosion rate of an EPDM in a solid rocket motor.",57,11

16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058375,"This work is focused on a hypersonic aeroelastic experiment involving a shock impinging on compliant cantilevered plate at Mach 5.8. The shock induces a pressure differential across the plate thickness that drives its oscillatory behavior. Transition takes place within the separated region, resulting in a fully turbulent boundary layer at the reattachment point, in agreement with previous relevant work. A schlieren system and pressure-sensitive paint are used to measure structural displacement and pressure distribution, respectively. For small deflections, transition results in peak pressure values 15% greater than twoway predictions based on unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. Peak pressure evolution is predicted with the piston theory with good accuracy. The reference enthalpy method is corrected on the basis of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solution, and it is used to estimate the heat-flux distribution downstream of the reattachment point. Görtler-like vortices are observed and measured in the reattachment region, and their magnitude is affected by the plate deflection. Large trailing-edge displacements result in a smaller streamline curvature at the reattachment point and, consequently, in smaller vortices. Finally, the data are used to predict the performance of two-dimensional control surfaces using the conceptual equivalence of oblique shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction and compression corners. This work aims to establish the accuracy of RANS simulations and low-fidelity models in the reconstruction of the peak heating and peak pressure evolution to bridge ground-testing and real-flight conditions in terms of flap-efficiency predictions and to design an experiment that can be simulated using computationally inexpensive two-dimensional solvers.",57,11

A recently proposed semi-analytical model (Yang and Morgans, Journal of Sound and Vibration , Vol. 384, 2016 pp. 294–311) based on the Green’s function method successfully captured this acoustic absorption and generation. The model pointed to the importance of accurately capturing the path followed by the unsteady vorticity shed from the hole inlet edge. In the present work, the effect of the path of the shed vorticity on the hole acoustics is systematically studied. The above model is combined with computational fluid dynamics tools for capturing how the path of the shed vorticity varies for small modifications in the hole inlet edge shape. A chamfered edge, a rounded edge, and two elliptical edge cases are considered to show that a very small change to the shape of the hole inlet edge can give rise to significant differences in the hole acoustic response.",57,11

The exact triggering mechanism of DC shift has not been understood yet; the main idea addressed in this paper is that the chamber pressure oscillations at the fundamental hybrid low frequency are triggered by the heat flux fluctuations occurring at a longitudinal acoustic mode of the chamber, and that those fluctuations are such that a net upward shift of regression rate is produced. A simple heat transfer model combined with the numerical solution of the thermal lag in the solid fuel is presented, which allows simulating the regression rate dynamics under mass and heat fluxes variations at the acoustic frequency. The computational results show that, by stimulating the thermal lag system with mass fluxes oscillating at acoustic frequencies, due to the boundary-layer delay time, the system is unstable, yielding fluctuations with the fundamental low frequency and a significant increase of the baseline steady-state value, whose magnitude depends on the time delay.",57,11

One solution to this is to develop low-cost screening tools that can be implemented earlier in the approval process. Auxiliary power unit combustors historically show the most sensitivity to physical and volatile fuel properties, making it a useful tool in assessing potential alternative jet fuel effects at test conditions representative of operability stability limits. It is hypothesized that these observations can be explained via timescale analysis considering fuel droplet breakup and evaporation, combustor mixing, and chemical reactivity timescales on the progression to lean blowout. This paper combines timescale theory with reduced-order fuel properties and random forest regressions to represent each of the identified timescales. Random forest regressions with only these timescale representative properties account for better than 95% of experimental variance across seven very different test conditions. An additional sensitivity analysis corroborates previous observations in which auxiliary power units are most sensitive to mixing, atomization, and evaporative timescales. Testing of these key timescale representative fuel properties requires 280 mL of fuel and could be used as a new screening tool for alternative jet fuels, reducing the time and cost for their approval.",57,11

This approach computes both of the fluid and structure fields by integrating respective harmonic-balance forms of governing equations in pseudotime, and variables of both fields are converged simultaneously in one shot. Several significant advantages of this code-coupling approach are observed. First, the computational cost is nearly independent of the number of structural modes retained in the analysis, which offers substantial computational efficiency over traditional aeroelastic solution techniques. Second, the solution of the two fields needs not be time synchronized, unlike what is required in traditional dual-time-stepping time-accurate approaches. This allows two solvers to use respective optimal physical time steps (different number of harmonics), different (optimal) pseudotime steps, as well as different integration techniques (explicit or implicit) to achieve the fastest convergence rates. The two operational modes of the one-shot method, which requires either the reduced velocity or the vibration amplitude as the main input, are discussed in detail. Numerical results of the AGARD 445.6 wing model show that the one-shot method can very rapidly predict the flutter boundary as well as the limit-cycle-oscillation response, offering a promising new technique to solve dynamic aeroelasticity problems.",57,11

Discrete material optimization (DMO) is performed to optimize the hybrid composite plates, with the buckling load as the objective and the material cost as the constraint. Because the effectiveness of DMO has been demonstrated to perform the discrete variable optimization of composite structures. Furthermore, an innovative DMO framework based on proper orthogonal decomposition is established to reduce the computational cost, with the aim being to improve the optimization efficiency by reducing the order of the corresponding finite element model, and thus the time needed for the finite element analysis.

For spherical shells subjected to normal tractions on a major surface, the effects are delineated on strain energies (SEs) of the in-plane, out-of-plane, stretching, and bending deformations of the following ratios: span/thickness ; radius of curvature/span ; core to face-sheet thickness ; and face sheet’s elastic modulus along the fiber axis to that of the core , where . It is found that, for fixed values of other parameters, the proportions of SEs of bending to that of the total deformations, as well as of the transverse normal to that of the transverse shear deformations, increase with an increase in or a decrease in the RPS. For , the SE due to bending deformations of the face sheets equals 29%; and, those due to transverse normal and shear deformations of the core are, respectively, 20 and 5% of the total SE. Thus, one should incorporate transverse normal deformations of the core in the shell theory for such problems. For fixed values of other parameters, the core’s in-plane deformations become more significant than its transverse shear deformations, with an increase in or a decrease in the RPS. The SE of the core’s in-plane deformations equals 30% of the total SE for , suggesting a need to account for in-plane deformations of the core for such shells.

27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058311,"This work demonstrates that local nonlinear attachments (stores) can influence the global dynamics of a model airplane under broadband loading by means of nonlinear redistribution of vibrational energy in modal space. Each wing of the model airplane hosts a single store, which is constructed so that, when locked (by a specially designed mechanism), it contributes only mass to the dynamics; when unlocked, it induces nonlinear effects to the system. An experimental study is performed by considering three plane configurations: both stores locked, one store unlocked, and both stores unlocked. The experimental study reveals that, when unlocked, the local stores drastically affect the global dynamical response of the model plane by inducing low- to high-frequency energy transfers in the modal space. These energy transfers significantly enhance the overall dissipative capacity of the plane, without any additional damping. Accordingly, this work promotes a new concept for passively enhancing the inherent dissipative capacity of a complex structure through the addition of local nonlinear attachments. On the other hand, local nonlinearities often arise from the way that stores are attached to wings: for example, clearances. This study shows that such local nonlinearities can induce global effects in the entire aircraft: some of which could be undesired.",57,11

The analysis of the influence of cracks, coupled with the influence of mistuning on the dynamics of bladed disks, is computationally challenging for several reasons: 1) complex geometry of modern turbines results in very high-dimensional computational models; 2) mistuning in these structures breaks the cyclic symmetry in these systems; and 3) cracks further disrupt the symmetry and introduce a piecewise-linear nonlinearity into these systems. Recently, several approaches have been developed to handle these challenges individually. The component mode mistuning approach was developed to efficiently model small mistuning in bladed disks. The method was developed for generating reduced-order models of cyclically symmetric systems with cracks. More recently, the generalized bilinear amplitude approximation technique was created to efficiently approximate the nonlinear vibrational response of a class of piecewise-linear nonlinear systems. This paper modifies and combines these techniques, for the first time, to enable efficient modeling and statistical analysis of bladed disks with mistuning and cracks. The novel method is able to generate the reduced-order model of full-bladed disks using only single-sector models and approximate the nonlinear vibrational response of the system with significantly reduced computational effort. A high-dimensional finite element model of a mistuned bladed disk with a crack is studied using the proposed approach. The influence of mistuning patterns and cracks on the vibrational response of the bladed disk is discussed.",57,11
29,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057797,"Recently, a novel probabilistic method for modeling and quantifying model-form uncertainties in a deterministic high-dimensional computational model was proposed and demonstrated for numerous applications in linear vibrations and nonlinear structural dynamics. The method relies on a stochastic projection-based reduced-order model (SPROM) grounded in a randomized reduced-order basis to accelerate the stochastic computations it incurs, and it accounts for all modeling uncertainties introduced by model reduction. It builds the probability model of the SPROM using a small number of hyperparameters, and it determines them so that the mean value and statistical fluctuations of quantities of interest predicted using the SPROM match target values obtained from available data. Hence, it can be interpreted as a probabilistic model learning or updating method. Unfortunately, even though it is performed using a reduced-order model, the hyperparameter identification process can be cost prohibitive. For this reason, the method is reformulated in this paper around the concept of hyper-reduction. Specifically, a reduced version of the mesh underlying the high-dimensional model is constructed and used to hyper-reduce the SPROM. The feasibility of the resulting approach is demonstrated for the model-form uncertainty quantification of generalized eigencomputations performed during what-if scenarios associated with shape changes of a jet engine nozzle.",57,11
30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058280,"The sensitivity analysis plays a significant role in structural optimization, and repetitive calculations are necessary for the analysis procedure. A reanalysis approach of frequency response functions (FRFs) is proposed based on the Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury (SMW) formula. Multiple perturbations are considered as the change of elements in the dynamic stiffness matrix, and the SMW formula is used as an efficient mathematical tool for solving the problem of repetitive calculations. The perturbed FRFs are directly calculated by the SWM formula, and then the sensitivity of the FRFs is obtained by using the finite difference procedure. The basic theory of the proposed method is illustrated by adopting a mass–spring system, which is extended to truss structures. A five-bay truss and a cantilever plate are adopted to verify the method. The lumped mass, the damping, and the cross-sectional area can be regarded as design variables. Results show that the FRF sensitivity is obtained efficiently by using the initial FRFs and parameter perturbations to avoid repeated finite element analyses, and the FRF sensitivity of simultaneously perturbed multiparameters can be determined by using the proposed method.",57,11
31,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058359,"Several types of uncertainties are encountered in the design of machines and structures. The geometric parameters or dimensions are specified in terms of nominal values and tolerances, the experimentally determined material properties exhibit scatter over a range, and many types of loads are inherently variable (loads due to wind, floods, and earthquakes). It is difficult to develop probability distributions to all such uncertain parameters. Even if probability distributions are developed, their confidence levels need to be established using a t- or chi-squared distribution. However, it is easier and more accurate to model the uncertain quantities/parameters as intervals. Thus, for example, in the interval parameter-based optimization, only the known or expected ranges of the design parameters are used with no need to establish the confidence levels of their intervals. This work presents an interval parameter-based optimum design of structural components. Although the field of interval analysis deals with computation of interval numbers, it suffers from the so-called dependency problem, whereby the computations get more and more inaccurate, resulting in wider intervals of the computed response quantities as compared to the true intervals if multiple arithmetic operations are performed using the same interval number or if complicated expressions are evaluated using interval numbers. Hence, a more accurate method, known as the universal grey number theory, is used in this work for the analysis and computations involved in the optimization procedure. Two numerical optimization problems, which are the design of a stepped bar subjected to an axial load and the design of a welded beam subjected to a transverse load, are presented to illustrate the procedure.",57,11
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058446,"A new structural design method is developed in this paper to improve the surface accuracy and enhance the performance of large deployable mesh reflectors. A self-standing truss with hard points (SSTHP), which is an additive pin-jointed structure, is composed of bar members and has zero internal mechanisms. The nodes of an SSTHP are hard points with little displacements when the stiffness of the structure is high in all directions. Through the implementation of the SSTHP, high surface accuracy, large effective region area, and nearly uniform member tension distribution are simultaneously achieved in the design of the reflecting surface of a deployable mesh reflector. The inclusion of the SSTHP also reduces the shape distortions of the reflecting surface caused by the deformation of the supporting structure. Those reflector performance enhancements obtained by the proposed design method are demonstrated in numerical simulations.",57,11

The knitting form, mesh size, and wire mesh ductility directly affect the accuracy of the reflector. In this paper, a form-finding design method that considers wire mesh properties is proposed for cable–mesh deployable reflector antennas. First, a three-dimensional geometric model of the wire mesh is established. Based on the augmented Lagrange multiplier method, the finite element method model of the wire mesh is derived, and its accuracy is verified by experimental data. Second, to simplify the computation for a large-scale flexible wire mesh structure, the mechanical model is made equivalent to an anisotropy membrane. Third, based on the nonlinear finite element method, the form-finding design method of the cable–membrane composite structure is proposed. The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the significant influence of the mechanical properties of wire mesh and the validity of the proposed design method.",57,11

This paper reviews a novel framing of the problem—precision margin—and introduces a new implementation using the first-order reliability method (FORM) for fast probability integration with principled design margin. This paper demonstrates that our margin in beta (MIB) approach preserves the incentive structure of traditional approaches, can enable lower weight penalties, is computationally tractable for practical engineering problems, and is provably conservative at a user-defined confidence level. This paper demonstrates in the sizing of a cantilever beam, and in the design of a complex, multidisciplinary supersonic nozzle.",57,11
