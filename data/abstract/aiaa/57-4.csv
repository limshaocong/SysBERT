Remarkable performance losses are consequently induced. An innovative concept is here presented that overcomes this limit. Plasma actuators are proposed as a means to stabilize separation in highly overexpanded conventional bell-shaped nozzles. A larger expansion ratio can thus be adopted in boosters and first-stage engines, and their vacuum specific impulse is increased. The concept is here assessed by means of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. The effects of the plasma actuators are described by average body force and heat source terms. The potentialities of this concept, adaptable to any bell-shaped nozzle, are assessed evaluating the possible payload gain for a representative case. The results show that the proposed concept allows for suitable payload growth and engine flexibility.",57,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057994,"A conservative representation of a chemical explosive mode analysis is formulated for flame diagnostics in compressible reactive flows. The flame characteristics are detected by the quantification of individual contributions of chemical reaction, diffusion, and compressibility to chemical explosive modes. The diagnostic method is first applied to analyze one-dimensional representative flames. The analysis shows that compressibility plays the dominant role among the nonchemical effects for chemical explosive modes in high-speed flows. Then, the diagnostic method is further applied to analyze the flame stabilization mechanisms in the Burrows–Kurkov supersonic flames, for which large-eddy simulations have been performed and validated against measurement data. Results show that chemical reaction controls the flame kernel formation, indicating that autoignition governs the flame stabilization. Furthermore, compressibility has the same order of magnitude contribution to chemical explosive modes as the chemical reaction in the surrounding area of the ignited flame kernels, which counteracts chemical reaction for the growth of the flame kernels.",57,4

Despite the fact that the inflow is uniform and steady, the resulting wake is highly asymmetric and unsteady. Two main vortical structures develop from the shear layers of the spheroid, with one being significantly stronger than the other. This asymmetry results in a nonzero side force. The forces acting on the spheroid change dramatically from earlier works at Reynolds number 3000. The pressure inside the vortex cores also change with this moderate increase in Reynolds number. This indicates that the flow is highly transitional. It is also documented that, close to the body, on the side of the weaker vortex, there is a region of negative axial velocity. In this backflow region, fluid enters from behind the spheroid and travels forward against the inflow and then exits the backflow region through one of the main vortical structures. This backflow has not been described before. A distinct Kelvin–Helmholtz shear-layer instability close to this region is also observed and described.",57,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057388,"The application of oil film interferometry (OFI) for the measurement of global skin friction on the surface beneath a complex three-dimensional supersonic flow is explored in this study. The flowfield is produced by a fin-generated oblique shock interacting with a compressible turbulent boundary layer. Measurements were obtained by modifying a comprehensive acquisition and processing software, previously developed for two-dimensional, low-speed flows, to measure skin friction distributions underneath such flows. This approach required the local flow direction on the surface, and therefore traditional oil flow visualization was coupled with OFI measurements. A cross-correlation-based algorithm was incorporated to extract flow direction from sequences of oil flow visualization images. Photogrammetry was used with both surface oil flow and OFI to ensure proper spatial overlap for the two measurements. Results from this study demonstrate the capability of the approach in a complex, supersonic flow field that contains regions of both separation and reattachment concomitant with a wide range of skin friction values. The skin friction results show excellent homogeneity, standard deviation of 5.1% of the mean, in the undisturbed boundary layer upstream of the interaction and capture well-resolved high shear gradients in the interaction region. A comparison to legacy data from a similar interaction shows matching trends within the developed flow.",57,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057814,"Time-resolved particle image velocimetry was conducted at 40 kHz using a pulse-burst laser in the supersonic wake of a wall-mounted hemisphere. Velocity fields suggest a recirculation region with two lobes, in which flow moves away from the wall near the centerline and recirculates back toward the hemisphere off the centerline, contrary to transonic configurations. Spatio-temporal cross-correlations and conditional ensemble averages relate the characteristic behavior of the unsteady shock motion to the flapping of the shear layer. At Mach 1.5, oblique shocks develop, associated with vortical structures in the shear layer and convect downstream in tandem; a weak periodicity is observed. Shock motion at Mach 2.0 appears somewhat different, wherein multiple weak disturbances propagate from shear-layer turbulent structures to form an oblique shock that ripples as these vortices pass by. Bifurcated shock feet coalesce and break apart without evident periodicity. Power spectra show a preferred frequency of shear-layer flapping and shock motion for Mach 1.5, but at Mach 2.0, a weak preferred frequency at the same Strouhal number of 0.32 is found only for oblique shock motion and not shear-layer unsteadiness.",57,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057658,"Laminar separation bubble bursting is a deleterious phenomenon resulting in a loss of lift and an increase of drag at relatively low Reynolds numbers. There are some criteria in vogue in the literature to characterize the onset of the bursting phenomenon. A relatively simple one-parameter criterion that was proposed, based on the work done in the authors’ laboratory in the past, has been found to be quite successful in characterizing bursting and is well cited in the literature, including in unsteady flow contexts. This criterion is revisited, and it is reassessed in the light of recent laminar separation bubble measurements over an Eppler 387 airfoil. Building on these foundations, the pursuit of a more robust bursting criterion that could also be predictive in nature led to a new simple criterion. According to this, bursting is signaled by the ratio of the freestream velocity at reattachment to that at separation reaching a critical value of 0.86. New engineering correlations are also proposed for the length and height of laminar separation bubbles that, along with the new bursting criterion, should be extremely useful in the design of low-Reynolds-number aerodynamic configurations.",57,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057458,"Discrete-vortex methods are a class of low-order methods widely used to study unsteady aerodynamic phenomena. However, these methods demand high computational costs when subject to large number of vortices in the flowfield. This calls for model reduction in discrete-vortex methods. A model-reduction technique is applied to a recently developed discrete-vortex method in which the criticality of the leading-edge suction parameter (LESP) controls the initiation and termination of leading-edge vortices (LEVs). This method, called the LESP-modulated discrete-vortex method (LDVM), has been successfully used in recent work to study unsteady airfoil flows with LEV shedding. In this research, model reduction in the LDVM is achieved by amalgamating suitable pairs of discrete vortices identified through a condition that requires that the velocity at the airfoil leading edge is not affected by amalgamation. The amalgamated vortex is placed at an optimal location to ensure that the bound circulation and the leading-edge suction are conserved. The reduced-order model is able to predict the flow features and the force and moment coefficients in good agreement with the full model while having significantly lower runtimes. Use of physical quantities like leading-edge suction and bound circulation enables the easy implementation of this model-reduction strategy in other computational methods based on discrete-vortex elements.",57,4

In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a low-speed closed-circuit wind tunnel in response to dynamic louver excitation is examined using an experimentally validated method-of-characteristics modeling approach. The model is used to develop and test a method of controlling the louver motions to simulate longitudinal gusts with a von Kármán gust spectrum for length scales from 0.1 to 10 m. Results showing improvement of the wind-tunnel dynamic behavior using a Helmholtz resonator are also presented.",57,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057686,"For helicopters in forward flight at high advance ratios, because of the cyclic variation of the angle of attack, the flow over the retreating blade can stall. This phenomenon, which is known as dynamic stall, limits the maximum airspeed of the helicopter. Physical understanding of the highly complex unsteady flow can serve as a catalyst for the development of novel flow control strategies that counter the detrimental effects of dynamic stall. For the present implicit large-eddy simulations, the complex flow over a rotor blade section with a Sikorsky SCC-A09 airfoil is decomposed into a pitching, surging, and yawing flow (dynamic crossflow). The heaving/plunging motion resulting from the unsteady blade bending under load is disregarded. Instead, the centrifugal and Coriolis accelerations are modeled. Three different combinations of the elementary flows are considered: 1) pitching and surging (baseline); 2) pitching, surging, and rotational accelerations; and 3) pitching, surging, and yawing. Simulations for an outboard blade section at a chord-based Reynolds number and a reduced frequency exhibit all relevant stages of dynamic stall reported in the literature: The bursting of a laminar leading-edge bubble is followed by the emergence of a strong dynamic stall vortex, which is eventually shed. When the harmonic yawing motion is added, the laminar bubble bursts earlier and the dynamic stall vortex is shed sooner. The addition of the rotational accelerations reduces the coherence of the dynamic stall vortex and, as a result, diminishes the cycle-to-cycle variations of the lift coefficient.",57,4

The theory is validated against experimental stability derivative measurements of a total of 13 flat-plate wings. Accurate prediction of is obtained to lift coefficients as high as 0.7. Results indicate that the tip vortex, and its expedited roll-up over thin low-aspect-ratio wings at low Reynolds numbers, is destabilizing in terms of . In addition, leading-edge flow reattachment at low lift coefficients, whether in the form of a separation bubble for wings with unswept leading edges or an elongated separation region on wings with swept leading edges, may be stabilizing or destabilizing in terms of based on whether the wing has forward or backward quarter-chord sweep.",57,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057481,"Junction flows occur when a boundary layer develops on a wall and encounters an obstacle protruding from this surface. When the obstacle generates enough of an adverse pressure gradient to separate the flow, the aerodynamic drag is increased. In this paper, aerodynamic shape optimization (ASO) is employed to optimize a wing/body junction geometry at a chord Reynolds number of , where the wing is the protrusion and the body is represented by a flat plate. In contrast to conventional ASOs, the wing shape is kept fixed and only deformations of the body are allowed in order to study its influence on the junction drag. The obtained optimized design is characterized by a concave shape similar to a dent in the junction area and differentiates itself from the traditional convex fairings. For this reason, it is named the anti-fairing. Wind-tunnel experiments using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry in the wake of the junction area and a new set of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations with a finer mesh than that used in the optimization are performed in order to validate the optimization, estimate the drag reduction with respect to the baseline geometry and two different leading-edge fairings, and investigate the mechanism by which drag is reduced. The anti-fairing is shown to systematically reduce drag and outperform leading-edge fairings thanks to the interaction between the wing and the front part of the concavity, generating a pressure force in the direction opposite to the drag force.",57,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057452,"Multifidelity methods are often used to reduce the cost of parameter space exploration, with applications to design optimization and uncertainty quantification. We present a multifidelity method to construct a reduced-basis representation of spatially (or temporally) varying solution fields and use it to explore the effect of variation in the geometry and angle of attack on the pressure coefficient response of a two-dimensional NACA 4412 airfoil in steady, incompressible flow at . Two low-fidelity simulations use 1) Euler flow and 2) coarse-mesh Spalart–Allmaras Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) with unresolved boundary layers. Each low-fidelity model is paired with a high-fidelity RANS model, to construct two multifidelity models that approximate the high-fidelity response associated with a set of parametric realizations. The predictive capacity and efficiency of both multifidelity models are analyzed and found to perform well for this combination of aerodynamic system and parameter space. In particular, the bifidelity model based on Euler flow predicts high-fidelity RANS results within 1.6% error at a cost that is 50 times less. Such a cost reduction demonstrates the utility of this method for industrial-scale design optimization and uncertainty quantification problems.",57,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057843,"Because reversible fans must be able to provide similar performance in either rotation direction, they need to have completely symmetrical blades. In the present study, an elliptic profile with its maximum thickness of 8% chord length at the middle of the chord line is studied. For verification, the NACA 0012 airfoil was once analyzed two-dimensionally in the isolated formation and once in cascade formation with 0.55 and 0.83 solidities, and the obtained results were compared with numerical and experimental results. Three well-known Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence models including Spalart–Allmaras, realizable , and shear-stress transport were used to find the suitable turbulence method. After making sure of the accuracy of the modeling procedure, lift and drag coefficients were calculated for the elliptic profile for a wide range of velocities, solidities, and angles of attack. A number of issues not previously addressed in detail by previous works, such as the important stall phenomenon at low solidities, were solved, and the obtained aerodynamic coefficients were corrected by considering the occurrence of the stall. Finally, the method of using the colored cube for the design procedure of these blades was also proposed to reduce the gap between the design and the desired outcome.",57,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057704,"This paper addresses the design of swirl recovery vanes for propeller propulsion in tractor configuration at cruise conditions using numerical tools. A multifidelity optimization framework is formulated for the design purpose, which exploits low-fidelity potential flow-based analysis results as input for high-fidelity Euler equation-based simulations. Furthermore, a model alignment procedure between low- and high-fidelity models is established based on a shape-preserving response prediction algorithm. Two cases of swirl recovery are examined. The first is the swirl recovery by the trailing wing, which leads to a reduction of the lift-induced drag. This is achieved by the optimization of the wing twist distribution. The second case is swirl recovery by a set of stationary vanes, which leads to production of additional thrust. In the latter case, four configurations are evaluated by locating the vanes at different azimuthal and axial positions relative to the wing. An optimum configuration is identified where the vanes are positioned on the blade-downgoing side downstream of the wing. For the configuration and conditions examined, the wing twist optimization reduces the induced drag by 3.9 counts (5.9% of wing-induced drag), whereas the optimized 4-bladed SRVs lead to an induced-drag reduction of 6.1 counts (9.2% of wing-induced drag).",57,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057529,"Based on the enhanced Messinger model proposed by Myers, an aircraft icing severity prediction model involving both parameter uncertainties and ontological ambiguity is proposed. In this method, the ice thickness at which glaze ice first appears is employed as the aircraft icing severity index. The random variables and interval variables are used to describe the uncertainties of the input parameters with effects on the icing severity index. In the process of predicting the aircraft icing severity grade, the membership function is introduced to describe ambiguity in how the icing severity grades are defined. To quantitatively measure the icing severity level, the generalized possibility index considering hybrid random and interval parameter uncertainties and ontological ambiguity is defined. Subsequently, the computational algorithm of the generalized possibility index is developed. Finally, the feasibility and rationality of the proposed icing severity analysis model and its solution method are demonstrated by a wind tunnel experiment.",57,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057399,"Based on a three-dimensional rotor icing model and the CLORNS code, aerodynamic characteristics of iced rotors in forward flight are calculated and analyzed. At first, ice accretion on the UH-1H rotor in hover and ice accretion on the spinning rotor blade rotor in forward flight are calculated. The results are used to validate the employed numerical simulation method through comparisons with experimental data. Then, the degradation of the aerodynamic characteristics of the iced SRB rotor is analyzed, and the variation of the pressure coefficients on the rotor blades is discussed in detail. Finally, parameters such as the icing time, the temperature, and the icing position are quantified, and conclusions are obtained. The influence of the ice accretion on the sectional aerodynamic characteristics increases along the spanwise direction, and deicing near the 0.7R blade section should be preferred at the beginning of the ice accretion. Finally, it is concluded that ice will not be removed in time if the deicer is activated based solely on the variation of the rotor aerodynamics.",57,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057010,"This paper investigates the use of point wall pressure measurements for output feedback control of Tollmien–Schlichting waves in Falkner–Skan boundary layers. A new approach is presented for input–output modeling of the linear dynamics of the fluid system and the integration with reduced-order control design. The pressure output at the wall is related with the global perturbation velocity field through the linearized pressure Poisson equation. A Kalman filter is subsequently used to obtain time-resolved estimates of the velocity field using pressure information at discrete points at the wall. The estimated field is in turn used to calculate an optimal state feedback control to suppress the instabilities. The controller is designed in a feedforward, a feedback, and a combined feedforward/feedback actuator/sensor configuration. It is shown that combined feedforward/feedback control gives the best tradeoff between robust performance and robust stability in the presence of uncertainties in the Reynolds number and the pressure gradient. Robust performance in off-design conditions is enhanced compared to feedforward control, whereas robust stability is enhanced compared to feedback control.",57,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057775,"There has been renewed interest in studying supersonic modes in hypersonic boundary layers. Recent computational results have shown supersonic modes in hot-wall flows, upending the notion that they exist only in cold-wall flows. Furthermore, supersonic modes with larger peak growth rates than the second mode have been encountered in a very blunt cone geometry. Therefore, conditions leading to supersonic modes and their dominant amplification must be thoroughly and systematically investigated. Specifically, the impact of wall temperature in high-enthalpy environments is of immediate interest. This work uses thermochemical nonequilibrium direct numerical simulation (DNS) and linear stability theory (LST) to simulate Mach 10 flow over a 1 mm nose radius axisymmetric cone. Despite LST results indicating no supersonic modes in either the hot- or cold-wall flow, DNS results indicate their presence in both cases, with the cold wall exciting the supersonic mode comparably to the second mode. Further fast Fourier transform analyses suggest that this was a result of the nonlinear interaction between an unstable subsonic mode S, stable supersonic mode F1, and the slow acoustic spectrum. Because the supersonic mode in the cold-wall case had a comparable growth rate to the second mode, the supersonic mode could impact transition unexpectedly if not accounted for.",57,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057604,"An investigation of outgassing effects on boundary-layer transition was carried out. This joint computational–experimental work mimicked heat-shield pyrolysis outgassing in atmospheric reentry conditions. A slender 7 deg half-angle cone with air wall blowing through a porous section near the apex was tested in the VKI-H3 Mach 6 hypersonic blowdown noisy wind tunnel. The steady transition onset location was measured using infrared thermography, whereas gaseous-naphthalene-based planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging enabled the visualization and quantification of the spatial characteristics of the instabilities. Linear stability theory, combined with the semiempirical method with , was used to predict the location of transition onset in the same configurations. Studies were performed at different freestream unit Reynolds numbers and blowing rates. Numerical and experimental results agreed within the experimental uncertainties, and they coincided with the previously reported advancement of the transition location due to wall blowing. The wave numbers of the most amplified second-mode instabilities obtained with the linear stability theory matched the observations done with planar laser-induced fluorescence, suggesting it was the growth of such perturbations that led to the transitioning of the boundary layer. The porous section was seen to destabilize the boundary layer for nonblowing configurations. Regarding the upstream advancement of transition associated with wall blowing, the numerical analysis suggested that it is a consequence of the increase in the range of unstable frequencies in the wall-blowing region. Blowing nonuniformities in the cone’s longitudinal direction were observed to have no influence on the local transition location under noisy conditions.",57,4
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057534,"The separation length employed to scale unsteady phenomena in strong (separated) nominally two-dimensional (2-D) shock/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions cannot be directly extended to three-dimensional (3-D) swept interactions, due to the quasi-conical symmetry of 3-D interactions. This paper examines the issue by considering large-eddy simulations of Mach 2 canonical flows arising from plate-mounted swept compression ramps and sharp fins at various interaction strengths, which have been the subject of concurrent experimental campaigns. Several key structural features are discussed that distinguish 3-D interactions from 2-D interactions in the context of free-interaction principles and quasi-conical symmetry, including their relationship to strong crossflow and open separation. The virtual-conical-origin concept is augmented by considering inceptive effects, which motivate the introduction of an inceptive origin. The dependence of the inceptive-origin/virtual-conical-origin relationship with interaction strength yields several insights and provides a more rigorous framework to quantify inception strength than previously available. Finally, examination of the spanwise dependence of the growth of the quasi-conical separated shear layer shows that the outer (main) layer exhibits spanwise-homogeneous symmetry consistent with 2-D free-interaction theory, whereas the inner layer exhibits conical symmetry, consistent with 3-D (conical) free-interaction theory. The ramifications for shear layer and shock unsteadiness, as well as acceleration of the inner layer and secondary separation, are discussed.",57,4
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057275,"The shock/boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs) generated by a negatively curved compression ramp are investigated. The ramp was mounted to the inner surface of a semicircular hollow cylinder, along which a turbulent boundary layer developed. Complementary experimental and computational investigations of the resulting SBLI are performed for ramp angles of 16, 20, and 24 deg at a nominal freestream Mach number of 2.5. Comparisons are made to planar cases with the same ramp angles to elucidate the influence of negative curvature on the separation size and structure. Measurements at the wall show that the negative curvature substantially increases the separation size as compared to the corresponding planar interactions. Off-body investigations reveal the focusing of shock waves originating along the circumference near the model centerline, which causes an elevation of the backpressure ratio beyond the two-dimensional limit. A constriction parameter is introduced to quantify the magnitude of this shock-strengthening effect. An area contraction mechanism results in a larger streamwise adverse pressure gradient downstream of the ramp leading edge and a reduction in outflow area that additionally inflate the negatively curved separations.",57,4

Experiments were conducted in a closed-test-section wind-tunnel, and a conventional beamforming technique combined with DAMAS deconvolution method was employed for the evaluation of the radiated noise. Nine seal positions along the slat cove wall and six different seal cross sections were tested for 3–9 deg angles of attack and freestream speed. Mean static pressure measurements on the airfoil surface indicated that the seals did not impact the airfoil lift but significantly affected the slat noise signature, particularly the low-frequency narrowband peaks. At some positions, the narrowband peaks were increased up to , whereas for other positions, they were virtually suppressed. At the noisiest position, even a seal whose height was 1.33% of the slat chord strongly affected the slat noise signature. Lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations in combination with the Ffowc Williams–Hawkings analogy were conducted for experimental cases selected and revealed the strong effect of the seal on the mean flow and the turbulence recirculation in the slat cove.",57,4

Optical observations provide macroscopic insight into the typical flow structures and reaction zone. The combustor operates in a cavity-stabilized combustion mode, in which a stable flame is anchored in the cavity shear layer and spreads into the jet wake. Particular attention is paid to the effect of turbulence on hydrogen combustion, which is often difficult or impossible to measure experimentally. Therefore, a high-fidelity simulation of sonic hydrogen jet injection into a scramjet combustor is conducted to provide a detailed description of the three-dimensional unsteady reacting flow. Autoignition occurs along the windward jet boundary, but the flame cannot be sustained due to the high local scalar dissipation rate. Two pairs of large-scale recirculation zones are generated in the cavity. Reflux with a long-flow residence time entrains hot intermediate products into the cavity, which continuously ignite the mixture in the jet wake. Then, the steady turbulent diffusion flame governs the combustion downstream of the cavity, and a large amount of chemical heat is released close to the stoichiometric mixture fraction.",57,4

All of the meshes originated from the same coarse mesh, a mixed unstructured mesh, generated through global uniform refinement for the purpose of evaluating the solution dependence on mesh and polynomial order. Because the meshes used for hpMusic and Fluent belong to the same family, useful information about solution accuracy and efficiency can be obtained. Detailed comparisons are made in mean surface loading, heat transfer, power spectral density of pressure at selected monitor points, mean boundary-layer velocity and total temperature profiles, and wake loss.

A point distribution obtained from a Cartesian grid is employed in a solution update, leading to an automated computational fluid dynamics process for point adaptation. An estimate of the local truncation error obtained as a higher-order residual is employed for effecting a solution-based point adaptation. A salient aspect of this methodology is the definition of a local length scale derived from an estimate of the truncation error, which not only provides a criterion for local refinement or coarsening but also can help in evolving an automatic termination criterion for the adaptive cycle.

To handle nondeterministic data, the proposed NDK method uses separate aleatory and epistemic uncertainty processes. In a general situation in which resources are limited in generating random samples, an aleatory variance is assessed via a local regression kernel process. It is often found that a prediction model built with a conventional kriging suffers from the overfitting issue, which becomes worse with noisy and random data. The proposed NDK method can provide physically meaningful insights into both the main trend and the prediction uncertainty of system behaviors by capturing uncertainty in the sample data and suppressing the numerical instability. The predicted uncertainty from the proposed approach can be represented in terms of distinguishable aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, which will be useful in a decision-making process for an adaptive model building and design exploration. The potential benefits of using the proposed NDK method are demonstrated with multiple numerical examples, including mathematical and aircraft concept design problems.",57,4

In the last 10 years, carbon-fiber/polyether-ether-ketone-based composites have become available with desirable combinations of strength, stiffness, and toughness properties. By combining the latest manufacturing techniques with these new materials and with new design methods, cheaper, lighter, and better-performing aircraft structures become a viable prospect. As such, a variable-stiffness unitized integrated-stiffener thermoplastic composite wingbox was developed, which was manufactured by laser-assisted automated tape placement with winding and in situ consolidation. The wingbox loads were determined by assuming its location to be at 85% of the wing semispan of a B737/A320-size aircraft. At this load, the wingbox was designed to buckle elastically. A full-scale structural test using a bespoke testing frame with representative bending moment and shear load was undertaken. Indeed, the wingbox buckled elastically at a load close to that predicted numerically.

30,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056398,"Fluid–thermal–structural interactions in hypersonic flows is an extremely complex coupling problem, which puts forward higher requirements on the coupling calculation method and computational efficiency. It is of great significance to design a fluid–thermal–structural coupled ground test to verify the effectiveness of the coupling analysis tools. However, because of the demanding requirements of testing tools and equipment capabilities, no relevant research on full-coupling test has been reported. This study aims to design a reasonable test model, including the size, material, aerodynamic shape, and structure of the model, for verification of the fluid–thermal–structural coupling analysis tools. Based on existing materials and facilities, as well as coupling test requirements, the exploratory design of the test model is carried out. The feasibility of the model design is preliminarily verified using a stainless-steel model by a 10 s short-time test in the high-temperature hypersonic wind tunnel of China Aerodynamic Research and Development Center (CARDC) and in-house FL-CAPTER (Coupled Analysis Platform for Thermal Environment and Structure Response) platform, which is developed by CARDC. The 60 s long-time test model using superalloy is also calculated, which revealed that the effects of the fluid–thermal–structural coupling problem must be considered during the design of the new generation of airbreathing hypersonic vehicles.",57,4

However, aspects regarding the identification of the kernels associated with the convolution integrals of Volterra series can profoundly affect the quality of the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). An alternative method for their identification based on artificial neural networks is evaluated in this work. This relation between the Volterra kernels and the internal parameters of a time-delay neural network is explored for the application in the reduced-order modeling of nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic loads. An impulse-type Volterra-based ROM is also under consideration for comparison. All aerodynamic data used for the construction of the ROMs are obtained from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the NACA 0012 airfoil using the Euler equations. Prescribed inputs in pitch and in plunge degrees of freedom at different freestream Mach numbers are used to evaluate the range of applicability of the obtained models. For weakly nonlinear test cases, the modeling performance of the neural network Volterra ROM was comparable to the impulse-type ROM. Additional accuracy and adequate modeling of stronger nonlinearities, however, could only be attained with the inclusion of the neural network kernels of higher order in the Volterra ROM. A generic expression is derived for the kernel function of th-order from the internal parameters of a time-delay neural network.",57,4

To ensure a successful mission, predicting the vibrations response of cable-harnessed structures is critical. It is commonplace in industry to account for the added mass of these cables and ignore the stiffness effects; however this leads to inaccurate models. The presented paper studies string-harnessed structures as a means for modeling the mass and stiffness effects of aerospace cables; damping is neglected. As periodic wrapping patterns have been modeled using a homogenization theory and experimentally validated, a natural progression of research is the study of nonperiodic wrapping patterns, which is the focus throughout this paper. A spatially dependent equation of motion is derived for the transverse vibrations of a string-harnessed structure. The equation of motion is similar in form to a spatially dependent Euler–Bernoulli beam model. The Lindstedt–Poincaré method is used to determine the frequencies and mode shapes of the system, which are then used to calculate the frequency response function. It is observed that the frequency response functions of the perturbation theory are in good agreement with experimental results.",57,4

The geometry properties and the vibration transmission characteristics of umbilical cables are crucial for the isolation performance of maglev vibration isolation platforms. The dynamic model of umbilical cables is studied comprehensively based on the nonlinear mechanics of a thin elastic rod, and the model is solved according to a differential quadrature method. A case about a cantilever cable is solved to verify the accuracy, efficiency, and convergence of the solution. The method to obtain an equivalent dynamic model of umbilical cables is analyzed, and the relationship between the excitation parameters and the disturbing forces/moments is obtained, which can be applied in the overall dynamic analysis of maglev vibration isolation systems. Experiments are carried out to verify the dynamic model, the numerical solution, and the equivalent dynamic model. To understand the applicability of the equivalent dynamic model, disturbing forces and moments caused by different frequencies, different amplitudes, and different initial configurations are compared; and the transmission characteristics of umbilical cables are obtained. The research has an important significance on the dynamic analysis of umbilical cables for maglev vibration isolation systems, and the method in establishing an equivalent dynamic model of umbilical cables is applicable.",57,4
