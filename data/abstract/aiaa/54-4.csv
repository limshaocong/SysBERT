0,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052947,"The paper focuses on understanding the mechanism of force production on a hover-capable flapping-wing system by using a combination of direct force measurements and flowfield studies. The experiments were conducted in air at a Reynolds number of approximately 25,000 (based on mean chord and maximum tip speed), which is the typical operating regime of small flapping-wing micro air vehicles. The forces and moments were measured using a miniature six-component force transducer installed at the wing root. The wing was flapped in air and vacuum at the same frequency and wing kinematics, and the vacuum forces were subtracted from the total forces to obtain the pure aerodynamic forces. Flow visualization and particle image velocimetry were used to characterize the formation, strength, and structure of the leading-edge vortex on the flapping wing. A rapid increase in wing lift coefficient was associated with the growth of the leading-edge vortex and a progressive reduction in lift coefficient with the convection of the leading-edge vortex over the chord. The leading-edge vortex was observed to be stable for the spanwise locations closer to the root (i.e., the 25% span location) and burst for locations away from the root (50 and 75% span locations) just after the midstroke. High instantaneous lift coefficient values were measured during the translational phase, clearly showing the role of leading-edge vortex in augmenting lift. However, lift-to-drag ratios were always less than 1. Aerodynamic efficiency during the translational phase was quantified in terms of figure of merit, which improved with decreasing translational wing pitch angle. The maximum figure of merit value measured was 0.36 at 40 deg translational pitch angle.",54,4

The main effect of the ground in pure pitching is to increase separation on the suction side, leading to larger hysteresis. At low frequencies, the airfoil under pitching motion can stall if the flow remains separated for a large part of the cycle. This type of stall is characteristically different from dynamic stall in freestream. Regarding the combined pitching and heaving motion, the pitch mode controls the flow at low frequencies, whereas the heave mode prevails at high frequencies. The interaction between both modes of motion is determined by the phase shift between them, and the modes can interact positively or negatively. The introduction of heaving can help improve the stall characteristics of an isolated pitching motion when flapping at low ground clearances.",54,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054205,"It is well known that structural flexibility enhances the performance of flapping foil propellers. There is, however, much less knowledge about the effect of deformability on the flow energy extraction capacity of flapping foils. Following recent work on an oscillating foil energy harvesting device with prescribed foil deformations (Liu et al., “A Bio-Inspired Study on Tidal Energy Extraction with Flexible Flapping Wings,” Bioinspiration and Biomimetics, Vol. 8, No. 3, 2013, Paper 036011), fully coupled dynamics of a flapping foil energy harvester with a passively deformable foil is investigated. Toward this end, the dynamics of a foil with a realistic internal structure (containing a rigid leading edge and a flexible trailing edge with a stiffener) in an energy harvesting regime through a fluid–structure interaction scheme is computationally studied. To examine the effect of different levels of flexibility, various materials (ranging from metals such as copper to virtual materials with arbitrary elasticity and density) for the stiffener have been tested. With the virtual materials, the effects of Young’s modulus and density ratio have been studied. The simulation results show that flexibility around the trailing edge could enhance the overall energy extraction performance. For example, with a copper stiffener, an increase of 32.2% in efficiency can be reached at high reduced frequency. The performance enhancement is achieved mostly in cases with low Young’s modulus and density ratio. A possible underlying mechanism is that the specific foil deformations in these cases encourage the generation and shedding of vortices from the foil leading edge, which is known to be beneficial to flow energy extraction.",54,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053674,"This paper presents a frequency-domain method to compute noise radiated from the rotating source and scattered by the surface, where both the acoustic pressure and acoustic velocity of the noise radiated from the rotating thickness and loading sources are computed with the frequency-domain numerical method and the surface scattering effect is taken into account by employing the frequency-domain equivalent source method. To validate the above method, the analytical solutions for noise radiated from the rotating monopole and dipole point sources and scattered by a rigid sphere are proposed. A good agreement between the numerical results and the analytical solutions has been achieved. Moreover, the Isom noise consistency test is also carried out to validate the frequency-domain numerical method. The analysis of the computational error is investigated as well.",54,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054363,"Recently, a definition of the lift-induced drag in terms of a field integral of the Lamb vector has been proposed in case of incompressible high-Reynolds-number flow and verified by postprocessing computational-fluid-dynamics solutions around wings. The possibility to extend this definition also to the case of compressible flows is investigated in this paper. An exact expression of the aerodynamic force in three-dimensional flows is discussed; it allows for a breakdown of the aerodynamic force (both drag and lift) in its physical contributions. Its applicability is analyzed in case of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes numerical solutions around an elliptic wing in subsonic and transonic conditions. A rigorous and unambiguous definition of lift-induced drag is obtained. It still depends on the vortex force of the flow (the volume integral of the Lamb vector field), but a compressibility correction term is also to be taken into account. Both viscous and wave drag components can be computed by a surface integral of the Lamb vector field in the body wake.",54,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054343,"This paper presents a novel approach for efficient uncertainty quantification and propagation in multidisciplinary analysis with a large number of coupling variables. The proposed methodology has three elements: Bayesian network, copula-based sampling, and principal component analysis. The Bayesian network represents the joint distribution of multiple variables through marginal distributions and conditional probabilities, and it updates the distributions based on new data. This paper uses this concept to develop a novel approach for probabilistic multidisciplinary analysis, that is, inference of distributions of the coupling variables by enforcing the interdisciplinary compatibility condition (which is treated similar to data for updating). The Bayesian network is built using only a few iterations of the coupled multidisciplinary analysis, without iterating until convergence. A copula-based sampling technique is employed for efficient sampling from the joint and conditional distributions. Further savings are achieved through dimension reduction using principal component analysis. A mathematical example and an aeroelastic analysis of an aircraft wing are used to demonstrate the proposed probabilistic multidisciplinary analysis methodology.",54,4

A coarse-grid direct numerical simulation was carried out to obtain detailed reference data. A laminar separation bubble close to the leading edge causes transition to turbulence of the suction-side boundary layer. The turbulent boundary layer separates near midchord. The considerable computational expense of this simulation provided the motivation for hybrid simulations based on the model and a one-equation renormalization group model. An extension to the turbulence models that “seeds” synthetic turbulence velocity fluctuations in the parts of the flowfield where the grid resolution changes is proposed but was found to have little effect on the mean flow. When the model contribution was too low, the turbulent boundary layer on the airfoil suction surface separated too early. By increasing the model contribution, a reasonable agreement with the reference data was obtained.",54,4

The simplified predictions are found to produce reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured values of burning-rate constants but not with their apparent dependencies on pressure or on the initial droplet diameter. Good agreement is found, however, with newly measured and numerically calculated flame standoff ratios in this droplet combustion supported by cool flames.",54,4

The calculating domains include the driven section (the shock-tube end, about 4.8 m length), the nozzle with about 8.9 m length, and part of the test section (more than 3 m). The characteristics of unsteady nozzle flow, including the shock wave patterns in the nozzle inlet region and inside the nozzle, were analyzed numerically in the viscous and inviscid flow regimes, respectively. The pressure and Mach number results were presented and discussed by comparing with the experimental findings, where the simulated results of the reflected shock wave in the shock tube and the transmitted shock wave inside the nozzle were found to agree well with the test data. Additionally, the case without a contraction section for the throat configuration was also calculated and compared with the case with a contraction section. The effect of the starting flow in these two cases on the flowfield uniformity is discussed in detail in this paper.",54,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054033,"Boundary-layer transition was studied on a sharp 7 deg cone in two hypersonic wind tunnels at Mach numbers of 5, 6, 8, and 14 over a range of freestream Reynolds numbers between 3.3 and . High-speed schlieren measurements visualized the intermittent formation of instabilities and turbulent spots within the transitional boundary layer. Surface pressure and heat-transfer measurements revealed how the intermittent behavior of the boundary layer produces the mean character of these quantities. Transition at Mach 5 appeared to be initiated by a combination of first- and second-mode instabilities. These disturbances were isolated and surrounded by an otherwise smooth boundary layer. At higher Mach numbers, the boundary layer was dominated by second-mode instabilities, which covered most of the model before breakdown into turbulent spots. The spots remain surrounded by second-mode waves throughout the transitional region. These differences alter the pressure fluctuations and heat transfer profiles during transition. Higher frequency pressure measurements peaked upstream of the onset of transition because of the growth of second-mode instabilities. Lower frequency pressure fluctuations and the surface heat transfer did not rise significantly until further downstream where turbulent regions developed.",54,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054137,"Approaches to predict flowfields that display rarefaction effects incur a cost in computational time and memory that is considerably higher than methods commonly employed for continuum flows. For this reason, to simulate flowfields where continuum and rarefied regimes coexist, hybrid techniques have been introduced. In the present work, analytically defined gas-kinetic schemes based on the Shakhov and Rykov models, for monatomic and diatomic gas flows, respectively, are proposed and evaluated, with the aim of being used in the context of hybrid simulations. This should reduce the region where more expensive methods are needed by extending the validity of the continuum formulation. Moreover, because, for rarefied gas flows at high velocities, it is necessary to take into account the nonequilibrium among the internal degrees of freedom, the extension of the approach to employ diatomic gas models with rotational relaxation is a mandatory first step toward realistic simulations. Compared to the previous works the presented scheme is defined directly on the basis of kinetic models that involve a Prandtl number correction. Moreover, the methods are defined fully analytically instead of making use of Taylor expansion for the evaluation of the required derivatives. The scheme has been tested for various test cases and Mach numbers proving to produce reliable predictions in agreement with other approaches for near-continuum flows. Finally, the performance of the scheme, in terms of memory and computational time, compared to discrete velocity methods makes it a compelling alternative in place of more complex methods for hybrid simulations of weakly rarefied flows.",54,4

To implement fast control system response, a new optical position sensor was built and calibrated. The 1.24 kHz synchronous control system, composed of a proportional-integral controller plus a double-phase advancer, made the rise time of a step response 30% faster than the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s existing magnetic suspension and balance system. The frequency characteristics of the magnetic field intensity formed in the test section were measured and improved to achieve faster performance of the control system. The control simulation of the magnetic suspension and balance system for the suction-type supersonic wind tunnel at Tohoku University indicated the appropriate conditions, such as increasing the moment of inertia of the model and setting a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz, and led to successful magnetic suspension tests.",54,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054094,"Large sampling uncertainty is generally introduced in the calculation of a low percentile of fatigue crack growth life due to a small number of coupon tests. It is often desirable to estimate a low percentile (for example, 10th percentile) with a certain coverage probability (for example, 95%) using the confidence bound approach. An equally competing objective is not to have overly conservative bounds.The performance of two bootstrap-based methods are investigated for calculating a one-sided 95% confidence bound on a low percentile of lognormal and gamma fatigue crack growth life distributions. A comparison is also made with the classical tolerance interval method and nonparametric (Hanson–Koopmans) method. These confidence bounds methods are tested to estimate -basis fatigue crack growth design life using material properties estimated from coupon test samples ranging from 8 to 64.",54,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054426,"Two isothermal round jets at a Mach number of 0.9 and a diameter-based Reynolds number of have been computed by compressible large-eddy simulation using high-order finite differences on a grid of 3.1 billion points. At the exit of a straight pipe nozzle in which a trip forcing is applied, the jet flow velocity parameters, including the momentum thickness and the shape factor of the boundary layer, the momentum-thickness-based Reynolds number, and the peak turbulence intensity, roughly match those found in experiments using two nozzles referred to as the ASME and the conical nozzles. The boundary layer is in a highly disturbed laminar state in the first case and in a turbulent state in the second. The exit flow conditions, the shear-layer and jet flowfields, and the far-field noise provided by the large-eddy simulation are described. The jet with the ASME-like initial conditions develops a little more rapidly, with slightly higher turbulence levels than the other. Overall, however, the results obtained for the two jets are very similar, and they are in good agreement with measurements available for Mach 0.9 jets. In particular, this similarity holds for the far-field spectra. Because the ASME nozzle has been reported to yield higher noise levels than the conical nozzle, this suggests that the nozzle-exit conditions in the large-eddy simulation do not adequately reflect those in the experiments and/or that the link between the noise differences and the jet initial conditions using the two nozzles is not as simple as was first thought, and that other parameters, associated for instance with the nozzle geometry such as the presence of pressure gradients, may also play an important role.",54,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054501,"This study investigates the effects of boundary-layer tripping on an oblique shock-wave reflection (, ) by means of particle image velocimetry. Laminar boundary layers are sensitive to adverse pressure gradients, and the interaction with an oblique shock wave results in the formation of a large separation bubble . The bubble can be removed by tripping the boundary layer a short distance upstream of the incident shock wave. Three types of tripping devices were investigated in this study: a stepwise trip, a patch of distributed roughness, and a zigzag strip. The step was found to be least effective at tripping the boundary layer, yielding a turbulent boundary layer downstream of the trip; whereas the other two trips required a distance of only . Consequently, at the same trip–to-shock-wave distance, the step was found to be less effective at removing separation than the other two trips. Although tripping the boundary layer allows for the removal of the separation bubble, it does come at the price of having a substantially thicker boundary layer downstream of the interaction.",54,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054464,"The performance of a multidisciplinary system is ineluctably affected by various sources of uncertainties, which are often categorized as aleatory (e.g., input variability) or epistemic (e.g., model uncertainty). Statistical sensitivity analysis methods allow for studying the impact of different sources of uncertainty on system performance. However, epistemic model uncertainty is seldom taken into consideration in statistical sensitivity analysis. Applying statistical sensitivity analysis for a multidisciplinary system is even more challenging due to the complexity in system analysis as well as the coupling relationships between subsystems. In this paper, a multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis approach is presented to analyze the contributions from various sources of uncertainties. Both global and local sensitivity analyses are conducted; the former examines the impact of variations over the entire range of design inputs, and the latter compares the impacts of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties to facilitate resource allocation decisions for reducing system uncertainty. Two types of sensitivity metrics are proposed for multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis: the extension of traditional variance-based sensitivity indices and relative-entropy-based sensitivity indices for situations with irregular system performance distributions. To overcome the computational challenges in multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis, a multidisciplinary uncertainty analysis technique is employed for handling the complexity associated with coupling among multiple disciplines and propagating uncertainty across multiple levels (component/subsystem/system). An aircraft design problem consisting of three coupled disciplines is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multidisciplinary uncertainty analysis method and multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis approaches.",54,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054532,"When the exhaust plume from a descent engine impinges on the lunar surface, loose regolith can erode and become entrained into a high-velocity spray. These processes are simulated in this work by several integrated models: a hybrid continuum–kinetic solver for the gas flowfield, a coupled two-phase flow model for a polydisperse distribution of grain sizes, and a model for inelastic grain–grain collisions. The continuum regime is modeled with the data-parallel line relaxation code, and the kinetic modeling is done via the direct-simulation Monte Carlo method. Simulation results are first presented for a single-engine lander hovering at different altitudes. Surface stresses and the resulting dust erosion are compared to classical theory, and correction terms are introduced to improve agreement. The velocities of different-sized particles and particle mass fluxes are shown for different hovering altitudes. For a four-engine lander, there are multiple plume–plume and plume–surface interactions that result in complicated gas and dust flow structures. These interactions are discussed for three hovering altitudes, and the resulting dust sprays are compared to those of the equivalent thrust single-engine lander.",54,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054445,"An efficient optimization framework of cylindrical stiffened shells with reinforced cutouts by curvilinear stiffeners is proposed in this study. First, an adaptive method to determine the near field around the cutout and far field away from the cutout is presented. Then, a novel hybrid model is established to reduce the computational efforts of postbuckling analysis; the numerical implementation asymptotic homogenization method is used to smear out the stiffeners in the far field, and curvilinear stiffeners are adopted to improve the loading path and thus local stiffness of the near field, which can provide a type of flexible stiffener configurations for cutout reinforcement. After that, the optimization of curvilinear stiffeners is performed by a novel bilevel strategy based on the hybrid model. In the first level, a stiffener distribution function is used to reduce the number of active variables, and then stiffener layout, stiffener number, and section profile are optimized simultaneously. In the second level, the stiffener number and section profile are held constant, and local optimization is then performed for each curvilinear stiffener location. An illustrative example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework, when compared with traditional optimizations.",54,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054485,"The vortex formation process in a two-dimensional starting jet at Reynolds numbers ranging from 1500 to 3400 has been investigated experimentally. The present results show that the formation of leading vortex pair can be restricted by the growth of secondary vortices from trailing shear-layer instability. The detachment of the leading vortex pair is found to be analogous to the pinchoff process of an axisymmetric vortex ring formation. The critical formation number for the vortex pair is identified to be around 7, higher than the value of 4 for the vortex ring formation. Because of the nonsaturated state of the vortex pair, the main mechanisms responsible for the vortex ring pinchoff (i.e., the Kelvin–Benjamin variational principle) may not be applicable in the two-dimensional cases. As such, the vortex pair pinchoff at higher Reynolds number can be attributed largely to the roll-up and growth of the secondary vortices in the trailing shear layer. The present results suggest that the shear-layer instability appears to be a major physical mechanism for the phenomenon of limited vortex formation in more general vortex-shedding flows, complementary to the existing theory based on the Kelvin–Benjamin variational principle.",54,4
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054580,"The numerical simulation of meso-, convective-, and microscale atmospheric flows requires the solution of the Euler or the Navier–Stokes equations. Nonhydrostatic weather prediction algorithms often solve the equations in terms of derived quantities such as Exner pressure and potential temperature (and are thus not conservative) and/or as perturbations to the hydrostatically balanced equilibrium state. This paper presents a well-balanced, conservative finite difference formulation for the Euler equations with a gravitational source term, where the governing equations are solved as conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy. Preservation of the hydrostatic balance to machine precision by the discretized equations is essential because atmospheric phenomena are often small perturbations to this balance. The proposed algorithm uses the weighted essentially nonoscillatory and compact-reconstruction weighted essentially nonoscillatory schemes for spatial discretization that yields high-order accurate solutions for smooth flows and is essentially nonoscillatory across strong gradients; however, the well-balanced formulation may be used with other conservative finite difference methods. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on test problems as well as benchmark atmospheric flow problems, and the results are verified with those in the literature.",54,4
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054575,"In most practical applications, the structural and material parameters of composite structures vary considerably and are subject to uncertainties, mainly due to the uncontrollable aspects associated with the manufacturing of composite materials. In many cases, the loads acting on a composite structure may not be known precisely. Fuzzy composite structures involve fuzzy uncertainties, which means that the structural and material parameters and the loads, as well as the model of the composite structure, are fuzzy. In these cases, fuzzy set theories, fuzzy finite element analysis, and fuzzy control theory can be used to model, analyze, and control complex fuzzy composite structures. Because the design of efficient and high-performance structural systems is of fundamental interest to engineers, systematic methodologies are to be used for the combined structural and active control system synthesis in many applications. To satisfy any desired structural and control performance characteristics of fuzzy laminated composite structures, the optimum design of the fuzzy system subject to specific structural and control constraints is to be considered as described in this work. The combined structural and control optimum design of both composite beams and composite plates are explored in this work and two numerical applications are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the methodology presented.",54,4
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054577,"A numerical simulation was conducted using the commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT to study the influence of inner flow structures on the motion characteristics of a separation oblique shock train caused by backpressure. Simulation results indicated there was a separation point of the boundary layer at the head of the shock train. The separated flow expanded in the isolator and led to movements of the shock train. With the shock train moving forward in the isolator, the leading edge of the shock train passed through the peaks and valleys of pressure along the forward path. As the pressure gradient at the separation point switched between positive and negative gradients, the state properties of the shock train movements transformed between a slow forward movement and a sudden sharp forward movement. The sudden sharp forward movement of the shock train always occurred when the separation point surmounted reflection points of the background wave system, which implies that the forward motion characteristics of shock train are related to the background flow structures. So, the occurrence of a sharp forward movement of the shock train can be predicted from the flow structures of a fully started state.",54,4
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053756,"A possible way to decrease interaction tone noise of a contra-rotating open rotor is through the application of trailing-edge blowing by reducing the momentum deficit of the front rotor wake, and therefore its interaction with the aft rotor. In this contribution, an assessment of front-rotor trailing-edge blowing is presented for the reduction of contra-rotating open-rotor interaction noise. For this purpose, the German Aerospace Center designed a generic contra-rotating open rotor that has been modified to include trailing-edge blowing at the front rotor blades. With the German Aerospace Center computational fluid dynamics code TAU, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations have been made of the baseline and the trailing-edge blowing configuration. Subsequently, an aeroacoustic analysis has been performed with the Ffowcs-Williams/Hawkings tool APSIM+ for both configurations. The results show negligible differences of the aerodynamic performance, with significantly lower unsteady loading of the aft rotor when the trailing-edge blowing technique is active. The aeroacoustic results illustrate that the interaction tones are notably ameliorated; that is, a reduction over almost the complete polar angle is seen when trailing-edge blowing is active. With respect to the A-weighted overall sound pressure level, a reduction of approximately 2.5 dBA in the maximum level for the trailing-edge blowing configuration is achieved for the considered geometry. Noise reductions up to 5 dBA are displayed in the up- and downstream directions, which mainly arise from reduced interaction tones caused by the trailing-edge blowing technique. The decreased noise radiation with trailing-edge blowing mainly stems from a reduction in the first two interaction tones.",54,4

This is the case posed in the First and Second International Workshops on the high-order computational fluid dynamics method held in 2012 and 2013. The correction function used in the flux reconstruction scheme is the Radau polynomial, which is equivalent to the discontinuous Galerkin scheme. A time-accurate implicit lower/upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel solution algorithm for the application of the flux reconstruction scheme to complex unsteady flows is developed, and it is found to be able to produce comparable results to the explicit Runge–Kutta scheme while achieving better computational efficiency. Simulations are carried out at and 8 deg with polynomials of degree , 2, and 3 resulting in second-, third-, and fourth-order-accurate flux reconstruction schemes, respectively. Two structured hexahedral O-grid domains that differ in the grid resolution in a circumferential direction on the upper surface of the wing are considered, with a maximum of 2,000,000 degrees of freedom for the fourth-order simulations on the finer domain. The results are validated by comparison with many reference data obtained from various high-order schemes using time-accurate explicit/implicit methods. The results agree reasonably well. The developed method with the flux reconstruction scheme can be a reliable tool of implicit large-eddy simulations for low-Reynolds-number flows.",54,4
