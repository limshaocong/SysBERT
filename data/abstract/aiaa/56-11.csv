This methodology, which is valid for all flow conditions, is then applied to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of nonequilibrium flow past a rotating cylinder. This work focuses specifically on the transition flow regime in which an inverse Magnus effect involving a directional change in lift force can be observed. In particular, the Magnus force and the inverse Magnus effect in subsonic flow are investigated by studying the variation in the aerodynamic coefficients and their normal stress, fluid pressure, and shear stress components. Illustrative results studying the aerodynamic force components as a function of flow rarefaction, Reynolds number, and incomplete surface accommodation are presented, which provide fundamental insight into the physics occurring under nonequilibrium flow conditions.",56,11

A realistic geometry with 1.5 stages is assessed using high-fidelity and low-order numerical methods for different clocking positions at approach operating conditions. The compressor efficiency and the acoustic noise emission are found to vary insignificantly between the simulated clocking configurations. Nonetheless, the pressure distribution is altered significantly, right upstream of the inlet guide vanes. Although the cut-on modes exhibit at least 10-dB-higher amplitudes, the cutoff modes contribute decisively to the wave pattern in the near field. An optimal acoustic liner design can expand on the differently evolving interference pattern of acoustic waves at discrete frequencies. The low-order model is found to predict the directionality of the acoustic waves, and the cut-on criteria for the individual modes is in excellent agreement with the high-fidelity simulations. However, the phase cannot be estimated due to the simplicity of the low-order formulation.",56,11

These lift curves were characterized using a two-term decomposition based on the quasi-steady components of the small-perturbation analytical model by von Kármán and Sears. Despite the unsteadiness of these maneuvers, the quasi-steady representation fit well to force histories from most of the tested cases. The amplitude of each term of this decomposition was compared to predictions made by potential flow theory and empirical models. Agreement between potential flow models and the unsteady measurements extended to plunge maneuvers with moderate unsteady to steady velocity ratios.",56,11

This work presents the first step in describing the aerodynamic performance of such materials and focuses on understanding the nature of such materials in aerodynamic applications. Load measurements are conducted in a wind tunnel for acrylic-based membranes supported in a perimeter-reinforced frame at different prestrains to determine which prestrain offers the widest range of controllability. Furthermore, photogrammetry and load measurements are conducted at zero prestrain for no-voltage and constant-voltage conditions. The resulting data show that, from a controllability standpoint as well as from a lift and aerodynamic performance standpoint, lower prestrains are more favorable. The resulting data also show that, at zero prestrain, the membrane damps most fluid–membrane interaction instabilities resulting in low-level membrane vibrations.",56,11

This paper discusses aerodynamic design considerations for the Hyperloop pod. A Hyperloop capsule travels in an unconventional flow regime (very low Reynolds numbers with high Mach numbers), which brings with it unique challenges. This work focuses on the aerodynamic design of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Hyperloop pod. For this design, it is crucial to delay separation over the pod as much as possible by forcing the boundary layer to transition farther upstream, resulting in a droplet shape for the aerodynamic shell. The performance of this design is investigated for nominal flow conditions as well as for flow conditions close to the Kantrowitz limit. The overall design of this team’s Hyperloop pod won the design competition of the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition in January 2016.",56,11
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056781,"Propulsors with boundary layer ingestion (BLI) generate a propulsive force with lower flow power input than conventional engines. This aerodynamic benefit can be traced back to its sources: reductions in jet, surface, and wake dissipation. A framework for BLI analysis is developed based on the power balance method: parametric expressions are derived for the net streamwise force on an aircraft and for the mechanical flow power required, as well as relations for the dissipation components. They illustrate the range of possible comparisons between BLI and non-BLI engine installations, and show how the benefit varies with design choices. Applying the framework to wind tunnel data from powered D8 aircraft model tests, the sources of aerodynamic BLI benefit are quantified for a realistic transport aircraft configuration. With the same propulsors (equal nozzle area) BLI reduces cruise power by 8.2%, of which 5.2% comes from a reduction in jet dissipation, 2.4% from reduced surface dissipation, and 0.6% from reduced wake dissipation. The jet dissipation reduction is equivalent to a 3.4 percentage points increase in propulsive efficiency. If the installations are compared at equal mass flow, the benefit amounts to a 9% lower cruise power.",56,11

The flow conditions of the DNS are representative of the operational conditions of the Purdue Mach 6 quiet tunnel, the Sandia Hypersonic Wind Tunnel at Mach 8, and the AEDC Hypervelocity Tunnel No. 9 at Mach 14. The DNS database is used to gauge the performance of compressibility transformations, including the classical Morkovin’s scaling and strong Reynolds analogy as well as the newly proposed mean velocity and temperature scalings that explicitly account for wall heat flux. Several insights into the effect of direct compressibility are gained by inspecting the thermodynamic fluctuations and the Reynolds stress budget terms.

8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057304,"A zero-dimensional model of nonequilibrium plasma-assisted methane–air ignition at atmospheric pressure is presented to study the effects of vibrationally excited species on ignition enhancement. It is found that the vibrationally excited species , , and especially can be generated efficiently when the reduced electric field strength is below 100 Td in a stoichiometric methane–air mixture. The results show that vibrationally excited species could not effectively enhance ignition via kinetic pathways due to their fast relaxation, but instead via thermal pathways through gas heating. Despite this, the thermal enhancement is much less effective than the kinetic effects due to plasma, indicating that the production of vibrationally excited species consumes the energy deposited in the plasma, and thus limits the production of more active particles, such as O, , and . A sensitivity analysis is conducted to further understand the detailed chemistry of the ignition enhancement involving vibrational excitation. The results show the reactions and have significant inhibitive effects on ignition enhancement in discharge conditions with a fixed plasma energy. The reactions involving the production of O and show promotive effects in enhancing ignition because they accelerate the radical production through chain branching reactions. Finally, the calculated ignition delay times at different temperatures show that the ignition enhancement by nanosecond discharge and the promotive effect of N are more significant at low temperatures.",56,11

The inlet profile is specified by inputting values from the profile specified by Castagna et al. Root-mean-square velocity fluctuations are input using the new variable of gyration from morphing continuum theory. Additional terms introduced by morphing continuum theory lead to a new formulation of the Q criterion, which allows for the visualization of three-dimensional turbulent structures including hairpin vortices. Streamline plots of the separation bubble show a more confined bubble than Castagna et. al. but agree well on the separation and reconnection points. The surface pressure coefficient matches Simpson much more closely than Castagna et al. Morphing continuum theory data were obtained on a cell mesh containing a smaller number of cells by an order of magnitude than that of the direct numerical simulation mesh of by Castagna et al.

10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057042,"A method for estimating the velocity fluctuations, hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations, and far-field acoustic pressure in a planar turbulent wall jet is examined. The Reynolds number based on nozzle height and exit velocity is 25,500. Streamwise-aligned, two-component particle image velocimetry and surface pressure measurements are obtained synchronously along the center line of the wall jet. Modified stochastic estimation is used to estimate a low-dimensional representation of the time-dependent velocity field, and performance metrics for the evaluation of the estimates are presented. The use of proper orthogonal decomposition in the estimation is evaluated against the estimation of individual velocity vectors from the measurements to investigate the filtering effect of using a subset of proper orthogonal decomposition modes in the velocity reconstruction. The velocity estimates are used to solve Poisson’s equation for the time-dependent hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations. Curle’s acoustic analogy is evaluated using the estimated velocity and pressure and compared with far-field acoustic measurements via a phased array of microphones. The estimated acoustic spectrum scaled by spanwise integration width is comparable to scaled measurements of the acoustic spectrum. The estimation method highlights the importance of the interaction between the pressure and velocity fields to the acoustic generation process.",56,11

The emphasis is on deriving a fundamental understanding of three-dimensional unsteadiness due to the different interacting free and wall-bounded shear layers. Simulation results on several grids compare well to data from a companion experiment, including particle image velocimetry measurements, time-resolved Schlieren images, and deck pressure spectra, thereby confirming simulation fidelity for the primary physics of interest. Even at design conditions, the asymmetry induced by the single-sided expansion and the aft-deck results in a complex three-dimensional shock train, whose interactions with the bounding shear layers yield many of the principal observations, including local separation of boundary layers developing on the expansion ramp and aft-deck, as well as plume unsteadiness. The mean transverse deflection of the plume, whether upward or downward, is shown to be related to the nature of the shock train components at the aft-deck trailing edge. As the plume develops downstream, three-dimensional characteristics become prominent, including corner effects and asymmetric entrainment. Spectral analyses and space–time correlations demonstrate that the signature of a shedding instability initiated at the splitter plate trailing edge permeates the entire flowfield, and influences the development of the shock train, deck pressure, and shear layers.",56,11
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056931,"The effect of a chevron on a radiated (acoustic) component of near-field pressure fluctuations in a high-speed compressible jet is experimentally investigated for a nozzle exit Mach number of 0.8. The main focus in the present experimental study is to examine the effect of a chevron on noise sources, their location in the jet flowfield, and the noise radiation pattern in the far-field through simultaneous measurement of near-field and far-field pressure fluctuations using a cross-correlation technique. The formation of lobes in the mixing layer close to the chevron nozzle exit alters the near-field and far-field noise characteristics as compared to the base nozzle. The overall sound pressure level closer to the chevron nozzle exit increases, whereas downstream of the potential core, it reduces in comparison with the base nozzle. Furthermore, the position of the near-field/far-field cross-correlation coefficient peak suggests that the interaction of chevrons with the jet flow moves the dominant noise source upstream and closer to the nozzle exit. The chevron nozzle disintegrates large-scale flow structures, thereby reducing the noise levels radiating at a lower polar angle in the far-field. The near-field/far-field cross-correlations suggest that an acoustic component of the near-field pressure fluctuations, propagating from the jet to the higher polar angles in the far-field, is generated by fine-scale turbulent flow structures in the region close to the nozzle exit, and the chevron nozzle is found to strongly support this mechanism. An increase in the noise levels closer to the nozzle exit in the near-field and at a higher polar angle in the far-field are due to high-frequency noise sources generated by the chevron nozzle.",56,11

One mesh is generated based on available experimental and numerical data, and based on this first mesh, a second one is carefully designed to improve the solutions in regions of strong unsteadiness. Results are presented in terms of steady and unsteady hydrodynamic data as well as noise predictions, which are performed using the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings formulation. Numerical results show good agreement with experimental data available in the literature. A wavelet transform analysis demonstrates that the sound generation in the cavity is an intermittent process that leads to strongly varying amplitudes of the surface pressure and the far-field noise radiation. A proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to identify coherent energetic structures responsible for the cavity tones. Finally, it is shown how the local flow topology affects the impingement of these coherent structures on the cavity.",56,11
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056662,"Recent research is showing growing interest in low-power electromechanical de-icing systems and, in particular, de-icing systems based on piezoelectric actuators. These systems use the vibrations generated by piezoelectric actuators at resonance frequencies to produce shear stress at the interface between the ice and the support or to produce tensile stress in the ice. Many configurations of de-icing systems using piezoelectric actuators have been tested and showed that piezoelectric actuation may be a viable ice removal system. If the many experimental studies already achieved have the advantage to present tests in different configurations, they often lack analysis of the phenomena, which limits the optimization opportunities. This paper proposes a computational method for estimating voltages and currents of a piezoelectric de-icing system to initiate cohesive fractures in the ice or adhesive fractures at the ice/support interface. The computational method is validated by comparing numerical results with experimental results. Other contributions of this paper are the study of the types of mode (extensional or flexural) and of the frequency range with respect to de-icing performances and the proposal of some general rules for designing such systems while limiting their electric power consumption.",56,11

A proof is given that mPOD reproduces identically the modes that would be obtained with the standard POD. mPOD also provides a systematic way to combine POD modes obtained from different simulations and to update POD modes using new data. A numerical algorithm based on mPOD is developed that shows a factor of 10 reduction in computation time compared to snapshot POD. The method is applied to data for fluid flow over a NACA 0015 at with an actuator jet on the top surface of the airfoil, and results are compared to methods such as subsampling, double proper orthogonal decomposition, sequential mode generation methods, recursive singular value decomposition (R-SVD), and partitioned R-SVD.

The result of this effect is that the mesh spacing near curved boundaries may not reflect the spacing prescribed by the user. A number of control functions has been developed over the years to counter this property of the Laplacian; however, these formulations provide only a local improvement of this behavior and often require user intervention. In the work presented here, a differential operator is derived that retains the strong smoothing properties of the Laplacian without the latter’s adverse curvature effects. The fundamental motivation for this new operator is the premise that the mesh curvature everywhere in the field should reflect the curvature of the domain boundaries, without the need for user-defined control functions. A detailed derivation of the new operator is presented, along with a number of applications to demonstrate its properties.",56,11

In many such applications, a functional of the solution is often examined as a proxy for the accuracy of the solution itself. Several measures of time-dependent functionals are used for test cases that have a periodic steady-state solution. The approach is verified by examining unsteady functionals for diffusion and advection model problems, and then the error transport method is applied to the von Kármán vortex shedding test case, a difficult problem to establish accuracy properties on its own. It was found that scalar measures of the unsteady functionals not only give the order of accuracy that would be expected from a primal discretization only but also the expected higher-order accuracy if the functionals were computed using the solutions corrected by this accurate error estimate, all without the otherwise necessary requirement of discretizing to higher order in both time and space for the primal problem. The results are consistent with previous studies on solution error using simple test cases with manufactured solutions.",56,11

High accuracy of the Chebyshev time-spectral operator is demonstrated by simulating the one-dimensional shock motion at constant speed. A space-time lower–upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel (LU-SGS) fully implicit scheme with multigrid acceleration is used to efficiently solve the equations resulting from the Chebyshev TSM. The implicit temporal coupling term is properly split so that the LU-SGS sweeps are extended to the time domain. For cases in which the physical time step is small, a modification to the implicit scheme is suggested to enhance numerical stability. Computational results of nonperiodic flows over a pitching airfoil are presented for different physical time steps and various numbers of Chebyshev collocation points.

However, gradient-based multidisciplinary design optimization is efficient only if the computation of gradients is fast and accurate. To this end, two high-fidelity aerostructural gradient computation techniques are proposed for strongly coupled aeroelastic systems. In the specific context of this work, the focus is on design variables affecting structural stiffness only. Scalar objective functions like aerodynamic performance criteria are considered as well as a field of structural grid forces. The most intrusive technique includes well-established direct and adjoint formulations that require substantial implementation effort. In contrast, an alternative uncoupled nonintrusive approach is proposed that is easier to implement and yet capable of providing accurate gradient approximations. The accuracy of these methods is first demonstrated on the ONERA M6 wing test case. Their efficiency and applicability are then illustrated via a mass minimization problem applied to the Common Research Model. Both methods lead to very similar optimal designs, and the detailed analysis of results promotes the nonintrusive approach as a promising gradient computation alternative.",56,11

In contrast to the majority of studies that focus on water entry of wedge-shaped bodies, this study addresses the hydroelastic impact of cylindrical shells. A cylindrical shape allows for a systematic study of the interplay between bending and stretching during water entry. This study puts forward a mathematically tractable framework to study the rigid body motion and elastic deformation of cylindrical shells, free falling onto a quiescent water surface. Donnel thin shell theory is used to model the shell, and Wagner theory is adopted to determine the hydrodynamic loading as a function of the rigid body motion and structural deformation. Galerkin method is employed to cast the problem into a manageable system of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are then solved numerically. Model predictions are validated against experiments on shells with two thicknesses, detailing both the flow physics and elastic response through the cogent integration of direct acceleration measurement, high-speed imaging, and particle image velocimetry.

Though Digital Thread is gaining traction as a digital communication framework to streamline design, manufacturing, and operation processes in order to more efficiently design, build, and maintain engineering products, a principled mathematical formulation describing the manner in which Digital Thread can be used for critical design decisions remains absent. The contribution of this paper is to present such a formulation from the context of a data-driven design and decision problem under uncertainty. This formulation accounts for the fact that the design process is highly iterative and not all information is available at once. Output design decisions are made not only on what data to collect but also on the costs and benefits involved in experimentation and sensor instrumentation to collect that data.

A requirement of SP is that all constraints and objective functions must have explicit signomial formulas. The SP MDO architecture facilitates the low-cost computation of optimal sensitivities through Lagrange duality. The specific example of commercial aircraft MDO is considered. Using SP, a small-, medium-, and large-scale benchmark problem is solved 16, 39, and 26 times faster, respectively, than Transport Aircraft System Optimization (TASOPT), a comparable and widely used aircraft MDO tool. The SP solution times include computation of all optimal parameter and constraint sensitivities, a feature unique to the presented architecture. The reliability of SP is demonstrated by converging a commercial aircraft MDO problem for a number of different objective functions and evaluating both traditional and nontraditional aircraft configurations.

Independent assumptions are taken for each layer of the laminated beam through a layerwise distribution of the unknowns, and the interlaminar continuity of the transverse stresses is imposed a priori by ensuring piecewise continuous fields in the thickness direction. A set of locally defined, hierarchical Legendre polynomials is chosen for the expansion of the variables over the cross-section surface, enabling the user to refine the model in particular zones of interest and to control the accuracy of the stress analysis through the polynomial order of the theory of structure.

This research proposes a new method to overcome this drawback by introducing the weighted-average and Du Fort–Frankel method into the damage modeling procedure. In the presented two examples, the stability analyses of the proposed two methods are discussed clearly. They show that the weighted-average method is unconditionally stable, whereas the Du Fort–Frankel method has a relaxed stability condition. Moreover, the uncertainties in machining tolerances are considered in two examples, and a stochastic simulation process (namely, the Monte Carlo simulation) is applied to quantify the corresponding uncertainty effects on the system performance. The results from the validation examples clearly show that the proposed method can induce a significant reduction in the computational cost and can be used in structural health monitoring applications.",56,11
