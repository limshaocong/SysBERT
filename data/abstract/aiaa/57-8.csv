2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056587,"A multidisciplinary sensitivity analysis of rotorcraft simulations involving tightly coupled high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics and comprehensive analysis solvers is presented and evaluated. A sensitivity-enabled fluid-dynamics solver and a nonlinear flexible multibody-dynamics solver are coupled to predict aerodynamic loads and structural responses of helicopter rotor blades. A discretely consistent adjoint-based sensitivity analysis available in the fluid-dynamics solver provides sensitivities arising from unsteady turbulent flows and unstructured dynamic overset meshes, whereas a complex-variable approach is used to compute structural sensitivities with respect to aerodynamic loads. The multidisciplinary sensitivity analysis is conducted through integrating the sensitivity components from each discipline of the coupled system. Sensitivities of lift computed by the multidisciplinary sensitivity analysis are verified by comparison with the sensitivities obtained by complex-variable simulations. The multidisciplinary sensitivity analysis is applied to a constrained gradient-based design optimization for a HART-II rotorcraft configuration.",57,8
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056513,"A multifidelity optimization technique is applied to the design of a helicopter rotor blade to improve its performance in forward flight. This optimization technique is based on a surrogate model that replaces the high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD)/computational structural dynamics (CSD) simulations necessary to capture the three-dimensional unsteady effects generated in the flowfield of a complex blade geometry. The single low-fidelity model based on kriging methodology and generated by lifting-line simulations leads to a power benefit of 2.5%, which is not reproducible by an a posteriori high-fidelity CSD/CFD computation. The optimization procedure using cokriging surrogate models based on two levels of fidelity (lifting-line and CSD/CFD simulations) leads to a realistic blade planform, for which the power benefit is estimated at 2.2%. This optimized solution, obtained after a factor-of-six reduction in CPU time, shows the advantages of using a cokriging surrogate model (rather than a single-fidelity kriging model) for aerodynamic optimizations.",57,8
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056486,"The design of helicopter rotor blades is a challenging task. On the one hand, there are the demanding simulations, which are a multidisciplinary endeavor. On the other hand, tools for parametric studies or optimizations require many simulations, making the design process even more costly. In the rotorcraft community, two routes for the numerical optimization task are observed. The first route is based upon local gradient search algorithms, which exploit low-fidelity tools or adjoint-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The second route is surrogate-based optimization in combination with high-fidelity CFD simulations. These surrogate-based optimizations can be further accelerated, when knowledge from low-fidelity models is used. This paper presents a framework that is developed for the multi-objective aerodynamic optimization of helicopter rotor blades including surrogate models based on different fidelities. The individual components necessary for performing a variable-fidelity, multi-objective optimization are reviewed before being applied. A novel technique to deal with unsuccessful simulations referred to as a failure map is additionally presented. The gain of the variable-fidelity optimizations in contrast to the single-fidelity optimizations is quantified, and a reduction in computational resources of up to 69% is observed. The failure map requires 78% less resources in contrast to the classical failure handling.",57,8

The framework is intended to be used for gradient-based design optimization of flexible multibody dynamic systems such as rotorcraft. The formulation of governing equations, the treatment of kinematic constraints, and the evaluation of functionals of interest and their derivatives are addressed. A minimal set of routines needed to implement the discrete adjoint method is proposed. The governing equations are integrated in time using a diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta method for second-order systems of equations. The formulation of the corresponding time-dependent discrete adjoint equations are presented and are numerically verified using the complex-step method. A verification of the dynamics, an assessment of parallel scalability of the analysis and derivative evaluation techniques, and a demonstration of the design capability are presented.",57,8
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056571,"The strand grid approach is a flow solution method where a prismatic like grid using “strands” is grown to a short distance from the body surface to capture the viscous boundary layer and the rest of the domain is covered using an adaptive Cartesian grid. The approach offers a potential for nearly automatic grid generation and adaptation requiring very few input parameters while, at same time, offering the ability to obtain fast and efficient flow solution. This paper explores the sensitivity of rotor hover predictions to various meshing parameters in the strand grid framework. Surface mesh resolution has minimal impact on the predictions, whereas both the outer extent of the strand mesh and the Cartesian mesh resolution have significant effect on rotor performance and wake predictions. A strand mesh extending out to half a chord distance away and a Cartesian mesh spacing of less than two times the outer boundary spacing of the strand mesh are recommended for most rotor blade simulations.",57,8
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056518,"The multidisciplinary design of aircraft typically includes considerations of performance, weight, fuel burn, and noise, among other factors. Objective functions and constraints reflect these considerations to weigh the tradeoff between different designs. Higher-fidelity optimization exercises have used an adjoint approach to reach an optimal set of aerodynamic objective functions, such as increased lift and reduced drag. The adjoint approach significantly reduces the computational time required to find an optimal configuration when there are many design parameters and few objective functions and constraints. Including acoustics in an adjoint-based design optimization requires the sensitivity of acoustic objective functions with respect to design parameters. This paper presents an approach for defining the sensitivity of several acoustic objective functions, including time-integrated metrics, such as effective perceived noise level, and frequency-integrated metrics, such as overall sound-pressure level. A demonstration, validation, and details on the sensitivity analysis implementation in the second-generation Aircraft Noise Prediction Program are also shown.",57,8

Flow is modeled using the Navier–Stokes equations, and wing structures are modeled using plate finite elements. A time-accurate procedure is developed to embed the flexible wing in an overset grid topology along with rotating blades. Results are validated with existing data from wind-tunnel and potential flow computations. Aeroelastic responses are compared for the wing with and without a tip-propeller system.

9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058524,"A modeling strategy to incorporate differential diffusion effects on both filter and subgrid scale in large-eddy simulation (LES)/filtered density function (FDF) method is proposed. Differential diffusion at the filter scale is resolved by the mean drift term in composition equations, whereas subgrid differential diffusion is modeled by the proposed modified Curl differential diffusion model in conjunction with a differential scalar mixing timescale model. LES/FDF simulations for a jet-in-hot-coflow methane-hydrogen flame have been performed to investigate the effects of filter-scale and subgrid-scale differential diffusion on flame characteristics. Results show that the predictions of the mean temperature and species distribution at the upstream improve significantly by accounting for filter-scale differential diffusion in the mean drift term. Meanwhile, the impact of accounting for subgrid-scale differential diffusion is in general not important for the predictions of the mean temperature and species distributions, because for the flame considered the controlling flame initiation process occurs mostly in the low shear region where subgrid nonuniformity is low and the resolved filter-scale molecular diffusion dominates over the subgrid-scale mixing. However, the incorporation of subgrid differential diffusion does improve the prediction of the conditional fluctuation of temperature in region near the shear layer where the subgrid nonuniformity is higher.",57,8
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057836,"This paper presents a strategy for mesh refinement driven by a new indicator that combines two previously investigated indicators: one based on a user-specified engineering output, such as drag or lift coefficient, and the other based on entropy variables. Using the entropy-variable indicator to adapt a mesh is computationally advantageous because it does not require the solution of an auxiliary adjoint equation, which for unsteady problems is particularly costly. However, the entropy-variable indicator targets any region of the domain where spurious entropy is generated, regardless of whether or not this region affects an engineering output of interest. On the other hand, an indicator computed from an engineering output generally targets only those regions important for the chosen output, though it is more computationally taxing because of the required adjoint solution. Approximations in the adjoint calculation reduce this cost, at the expense of indicator accuracy. In combining these indicators, our objective is to maintain the low cost of approximate adjoint solutions while achieving improved indicator accuracy from the entropy variables. This paper demonstrates the potential for this method through several simulations governed by the compressible Navier–Stokes equations using both hanging-node refinement and mesh optimization via error sampling and synthesis. In general, mesh optimization via error sampling and synthesis will provide more optimal meshes, but often it is not a viable option. This demonstrates the need to show that the combined approach benefits are not dependent on the mesh adaptation strategy.",57,8
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058114,"A series of far-field methods based on the momentum balance have been developed recently to predict and decompose the aerodynamic drag in the steady flow past a body. In this work, a far-field approach based on the energy equation is developed to study the aerodynamic drag in compressible flows. A new drag formula expressed solely by a wake-plane integral is derived. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation is solved for flows past the RAE 2822 airfoil and the ONERA M6 wing. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of the present drag formula, and they show that the integrand is compact and positive almost everywhere in the wake. Using the concept of exergy, the drag is further decomposed to a reversible component, an irreversible component, and a minor component related to the viscosity and heat conduction on the wake plane. The behavior of each drag component is discussed.",57,8
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058059,"Unsteady flow separation in rotationally augmented flow fields plays a significant role in the aerodynamic performance of industrial rotors, including wind turbines. Current computational models underestimate the aerodynamic loads due to the inaccurate prediction of the emergence and severity of unsteady flow separation, especially in response to a sudden change in the effective angle of attack. Through the use of time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV), coherent structure formation during the unsteady separation over an experimental wind turbine blade is examined. Time-dependent empirical mode decomposition results during a dynamic pitching cycle give insight into the spatio-temporal scales that influence the transition from attached to separated flow. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) modes are represented as two-dimensional fields and are analyzed together with Lagrangian coherent structures, the spatial distribution of vortices, the location of the separation point, and velocity contours focusing on the role of vortex shedding and shear-layer perturbation in unsteady flow separation, stall, and reattachment. The combination of these analytical techniques provides experimental evidence that the location of the separation point and the stability of the shear layer are directly influenced by the presence of vortices. Within this paper, each of the scales represented by the EMD are directly connected to the size of the vortices present, from the smallest representing a vortex radius to the largest reaching to two full vortex diameters. The velocity scales and spatial scales provided by the EMD modes are also found to supply valuable inputs into the identification of Lagrangian coherent structures within each of the PIV snapshots. This indicates that the scales captured by the EMD can be used to extract important turbulent scales present at the point of flow separation where the vortices are created, providing relenvant insight into the separation dynamics of the airfoil.",57,8
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057546,"The responses of a NACA0012 airfoil and a large-aspect-ratio wing, subjected to gust excitation about high mean angles of attack, close to stall, are presented here. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes turbulent simulations were employed to compare the gust responses at high and low mean angles of attack. It was observed that, for a rigid configuration at incipient stall conditions, the peak aerodynamic loads due to short gust lengths are higher than their counterparts at low angles of attack. However, they decrease asymptotically with increasing gust length. A convolution-based gust analysis methodology that can predict accurate gust loads at incipient stall conditions is also presented. The convolution-based method was employed to perform tuned-gust analysis with varying wing stiffness. The results show that the changes in peak modal displacements with wing flexibility at incipient stall are significantly different from their low-angle-of-attack counterparts, resulting in significantly different critical gust lengths, and 40% lower peak bending moment for a moderately flexible wing. This shows that high-fidelity gust analysis is imperative at incipient stall conditions, and the convolution-based method provides a computationally efficient yet accurate approach to achieve this.",57,8
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057978,"This paper presents a computational method to study a translating flat plate at steady velocity encountering a sudden transverse gust for different gust magnitudes and airfoil angles of incidence at a low Reynolds number . An extended split velocity method (SVM) was used to model flat-plate wing/gust encounters in a three-dimensional Navier–Stokes (N-S) solver. The gust velocity in the flow domain was prescribed to the grid points. Source terms were derived analytically from the N-S equations and added to the solver to account for the full interaction between the airfoil and the gust. The effect of the source terms on the results is evaluated for different gust ratios (, 0.4 and 0.8) at fixed-wing incidence angles of 0 and 45 deg. The results using the SVM were compared with those from the field velocity method: a simplification of the SVM that does not include the gust source terms. Inclusion of these source terms was found to be essential to capture the full interaction, especially when the flow was initially separated. In these cases, the source terms reduced the normal force peak and delayed the response when compared to the results without gust source terms. The computational predictions of the aerodynamic forces obtained from the SVM were then compared to experimental measurements. The validation cases focused on a flat-plate wing at a 0 deg incidence encountering an intermediate transverse gust and a flat-plate wing at 45 deg encountering a large transverse gust .",57,8

The wings have an aspect ratio and a NACA 0012 section. Three values of sweep angle are considered, , and 30°. The flow parameters are freestream Mach number and chord Reynolds numbers . A sinusoidal pitching motion is considered with reduced frequency and minimum and maximum angles of attack of 4° and 22°. The unsteady flow structure is examined in order to provide a model of 3D dynamic stall over finite swept wings. For all configurations, the dynamic stall vortex evolves into an arch-type structure that is shed following its transformation into a ring vortex. For , there is a single and larger arch vortex centered about midspan. For the swept cases, arch vortices are formed on each side of the wing at a spanwise station that moves farther outboard with increasing sweep. For , the outer leg of the arch vortex interacts strongly with the wing tip flow and abrupt tip stall is observed.",57,8
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058232,"This work explores the aerodynamics of an airfoil oscillating in a uniform-shear flow at chord Reynolds number of approximately using complementary two-dimensional Navier–Stokes computations and direct force measurements. A NACA-0012 airfoil is pitched harmonically about its quarter-chord, with 2° amplitude and reduced frequency up to 12, in positive-shear approach flow for nondimensional shear rates in the range 0.0–1.0. The results show that the wake of the airfoil exhibits symmetry breaking that leads to a deflected wake toward the high-speed side as the reduced frequency increases beyond the reduced frequency for an aligned vortex street. The frequency at which the vortex alignment takes place is nearly independent of nondimensional shear rate. Interestingly, the presence of shear seems to have little or no effect on the average drag/thrust and root mean square (rms) of the lift and thrust fluctuation, whereas a prominent influence is seen on the average lift. The latter switches sign from negative to positive at a reduced frequency of approximately 3, and it increases in magnitude with both increasing nondimensional shear rate and reduced frequency.",57,8
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057905,"This paper presents a partial differential equation approach to model the icing front evolution on airfoils via the level-set equation, offering a high-fidelity alternative to common algebraic approaches. Furthermore, the automation of the multilayer icing process is achieved by using B-spline curves to improve the geometry representation, which is usually limited to linear segments. The B-splines are generated using a curve approximation algorithm based on an error-controlled knot insertion together with a least-square minimization process, allowing an adequate shape representation of the ice irregular features. The evolution of the level-set interface depends on the so-called icing velocity, which is computed locally in the field from the propagated surface ice mass accretion rate solution. Additionally, an explicit swept volume tracking method controls actively the global conservation of the ice volume. A verification phase is performed on analytical cases to highlight the characteristics of the methods and discretization schemes. Multilayer icing results are then presented on two cases and compared with experimental data providing a reasonable global mass error level in each case. Overall, the method shows great potential to model the ice geometry evolution in a globally conservative manner while ensuring a smooth geometry representation that improves multilayer automation.",57,8
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057664,"Direct numerical simulations were carried out in order to reproduce the generation and control of transition on a flat plate by means of local dynamic surface modification. The configuration and flow conditions are similar to those of an experimental arrangement that employed piezoelectrically driven actuators to impart small-amplitude local deformation of the plate surface. One actuator was located in the upstream plate region, and it was oscillated at the most unstable frequency of 250 Hz in order to generate small disturbances that amplified Tollmien–Schlichting instabilities. A second actuator, placed downstream, was then oscillated at the same frequency, but with an appropriate phase shift and amplitude in order to mitigate the disturbance growth and delay the transition process. Numerical solutions were obtained for the two-dimensional and three-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations using a high-fidelity numerical scheme and an implicit time-marching approach. Local surface modification of the plate was enforced via grid deformation. An empirical process was developed for determining the optimal phase shift and amplitude of the controlling actuator. Results of the simulations are described, and features of the flowfields are elucidated.",57,8
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057876,"Active flow control (AFC) subscale experiments were conducted at the Lucas Wind Tunnel of the California Institute of Technology. Tests were performed on a generic vertical tail model at low speeds. Fluidic oscillators were used at the trailing edge of the main element (vertical stabilizer) to redirect the flow over the rudder and delay or prevent flow separation. Side force increases in excess of 50% were achieved with a 2% momentum coefficient input. The results indicated that a collective of about 1% could increase the side force by 30–50%. This result is achieved by reducing the spanwise flow on the swept back wings that contributes to early flow separation near their tips. These experiments provided the technical backdrop to test the full-scale Boeing 757 vertical tail model equipped with a fluidic oscillator system at the National Full-scale Aerodynamics Complex 40-by 80-foot Wind Tunnel, NASA Ames Research Center. The is shown to be an important parameter for scaling a fluidic oscillator AFC system from subscale to full-scale wind tunnel tests.

20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058241,"The aircraft deicing and detection tasks are complicated by the revealed existence of a shadow zone behind the wings, which contains no droplets due to the wing shielding effect. The effects of this so-called droplet shadow zone on the droplet distribution along the cylinder and the wing are theoretically and experimentally explored in this study. The computational domain of droplet motion is subdivided into a droplet flow zone and a droplet shadow zone. The interface between the two zones is captured by the level set method. The content of liquid water in the droplet shadow zone is zero. Outside the droplet shadow zone, the droplet trajectories are predicted using the Eulerian two-phase flow model. Fick’s law of diffusion is introduced into the Eulerian and level set equations. On this basis, a method for capturing the droplet trajectories and interface with an account of the diffusion effect is proposed. Besides, a series of experiments is carried out in the icing wind tunnel of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. The calculation and experimental results indicate that the proposed method can accurately predict the droplet shadow, and the calculated values of droplet collection coefficient also agree well with the experimental ones.",57,8
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058301,"This Paper introduces a feedback-type fluidic oscillator design with adjustable frequency at a constant flow rate. Details of the internal and external flowfields were revealed by numerical simulations with the help of frequency measurements and visualizations. Fluidic oscillator’s internal flowfield was manipulated by fluid injection from the islands of the oscillator into the interaction chamber. The interaction between the oscillator’s main jet and the control jets was observed to generate vortices in the mixing shear layers of the jets due to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities. These vortices started to govern the separation bubble characteristics as the control flow rate was increased. After a certain control flow rate threshold was exceeded, the oscillations were no longer controlled by the feedback flow. Instead they were controlled by the vortices generated by the instabilities, resulting in much higher frequencies. These high-frequency oscillations in the supermode control flow rates were determined to be as high as five times the regular frequency of the oscillator. However, a reverse relationship between frequency and sweep angle was also identified. Depending on the amount of control flow at a constant total flow rate, three regions and five cases distributed in these regions are reported.",57,8
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057731,"This paper presents a multidisciplinary framework for a design under uncertainty that leverages surrogate models trained using risk-adaptive statistical learning. The hydrodynamic and structural features of a supercavitating hydrofoil designed to support the displacement of ultrafast vessels are described. Surrogate models predicting superquantile risk of multiple competing quantities of interest are constructed, which adapt to the risk averseness level of a particular design stage. To accurately train surrogate models, simulation data provided by two computational frameworks are leveraged, predicting hydrodynamic and solid mechanics quantities of interest. Each framework provides data at low- and high-fidelity levels through a multiresolution approach for the hydrodynamic quantities (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes at high and low resolutions), and a multifidelity approach for the solid mechanics predictions (full three-dimensional and a simple beam). The framework is demonstrated through the design of a complex supercavitating hydrofoil, but the method is generally applicable to the design of a complex physical system under uncertainty.",57,8

In the present work, an experimental campaign is performed to determine the effectiveness of microramp VGs at shock-induced separation control in an axisymmetric configuration. The baseline flowfield consists of a shock-induced separation generated by a 20 deg axisymmetric ramp mounted within a half-cylindrical duct at and . The near-wall VG flowfield and pressure field are first characterized to ensure consistency with planar microramp configurations. The effects of streamwise placement and single/multiple VGs on the shock-/boundary-layer interaction are subsequently investigated.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057874,"This study investigates the large-scale unsteadiness of the 3D shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction generated by a 22.5° compression ramp with 30° sweep in a Mach 2 flow. This study extends previous work to examine the possible unsteadiness mechanisms of the separation line in differing frequency bands. This is achieved through ensemble averaging and lower-order proper orthogonal decomposition reconstructions that are targeted to extract certain physical processes. Unsteadiness is examined within three frequency bands: low frequency , midfrequency , and high frequency . Each frequency band contains a very similar degree of kinetic energy and likely contributes equally to the movement of the separation line. The low- and midfrequency unsteadiness of the separation line continues to show a strong correlation with the inflowing boundary-layer velocity, with boundary-layer superstructures driving the midfrequency unsteadiness. The high-frequency unsteadiness appears related to coherent structures within the separation region, which form in alternating pairs of high- and low-velocity deficit and appear to cause the separation line to ripple as they travel with the cross-flow. The frequency of this type of unsteadiness is dependent on the cross-flow velocities and the size of the separation structures, a finding that agrees with the literature.",57,8
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057818,"The behavior of oscillation modes in a supersonic flow of a Mach number of 1.58 over a cavity of and was studied using wind-tunnel experiments. Through instantaneous shadowgraph visualization, the leading-edge shock and trailing-edge shock were both found to be at antiphase to one another for the first mode. Simultaneous unsteady pressure measurements were carried out at the front and aft walls of the cavity. From a wavelet analysis, the dominant mode was found to be the second mode, which prevailed for a major duration of the measurement time. Mode switching was observed between the first and second modes of oscillation. The mean velocity of the vortical disturbance convecting downstream and the acoustic disturbance travelling upstream inside the cavity was determined from a cross-correlation analysis. An examination using wavelet coherence revealed the coherence and phase difference existing between the pressure signal at the front and aft walls. The phase difference estimated from the measurements indicated the strong influence of cavity acoustic resonance on the cavity oscillations. However, the phase difference values showed a slight deviation between the acoustic resonance and cavity modes owing to the standoff distance between the trailing-edge shock and the aft wall.",57,8
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057514,"In this paper, the origin and the properties of the oscillation modes in screeching non-ideally expanded rectangular jets are investigated using compressible implicit LES of rectangular supersonic jets. At the exit of a converging diverging rectangular nozzle of aspect ratio 2 and of design Mach number 1.5, the jets are under- and over-expanded. Seven simulations with four different temperature ratios ranging from 1 to 3 and two different nozzle pressure ratios are performed. The geometry of the nozzle and the exit conditions are chosen such that to match the experimental study conducted at the University of Cincinnati. First, the over-expanded jets are studied. It is shown that the total number of shock cells decreases with increased temperature ratio. However, the temperature does not influence the size of the first shock cell and the linear decrease of the shock cell size in the downstream direction. The spreading of the jet is observed to be higher along the minor axis plane than along the major axis plane. The intensity of the screech noise increases with the temperature ratio in the present study although the opposite is observed in the experiments. Moreover, for jet temperature ratios of 2.5 and 3, the strong flapping motion of the jet along the minor axis plane due to the screech feedback mechanism yields to an antisymmetric organization of the Mach wave radiation. Thereafter, the near- and far-field acoustic are studied. In the near-field, screech tones are captured, whose frequencies are consistent with both experimental data and theoretical models. In the far-field, four acoustic components typical of non-ideally expanded supersonic jets are observed, namely the screech noise, the broadband shock-associated noise, the mixing noise and the Mach wave noise. Their directivities and frequencies are in agreement with experimental results and models. The mechanism of the screech noise generation is studied by using a Fourier decomposition of the pressure field. For the four over-expanded jets, a flapping motion along the diagonal or along the minor axis plane of the jet is noted. Finally, the hypothesis that the acoustic waves completing the feedback loop in these jets are linked to the upstream-propagating acoustic wave modes of the equivalent ideally expanded jets is tested. Using a jet vortex sheet model to describe the dispersion relations of these modes, it is found that this hypothesis allows us to explain the antisymmetric jet oscillation observed at the screech frequencies. Based on frequency-wavenumber decomposition of the pressure fluctuations in the jets, it is shown that at the screech frequencies, acoustic waves propagating in the upstream direction at the ambient speed of sound exist also in the jet flow, additionally to the acoustic waves propagating outside of the jet. These acoustic waves belong to the neutral acoustic wave modes of the equivalent ideally expanded jet. These results support the idea that a vortex sheet model of the corresponding 2-D planar ideally expanded jet is capable of predicting the wave modes of a non-ideally expanded rectangular supersonic jet. They also suggest that these waves are involved in the feedback part of the screech mechanism; explaining why, for the simulated screeching rectangular jets, the associated oscillation mode is antisymmetric.",57,8
27,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057674,"The present work uses large-eddy simulations to analyze the effectiveness of a noise reduction strategy on a military-style nozzle based on the GE F400-series engines. The nozzle has a design Mach number of 1.65 and is operated in supersonic overexpanded jet conditions. The characteristics of unheated and heated jets are presented and compared. The noise reduction strategy developed at the Pennsylvania State University is based on injectors blowing air into the diverging section of the nozzle to emulate the effect of interior corrugation. The injection can be activated during takeoff and turned off during other phases of flight so that performance is not adversely affected. The injectors have the potential to break down the shock cells into smaller and weaker structures, affecting the mechanisms that generate broadband shock-associated noise and to weaken the larger-scale turbulent structures. The overall sound pressure levels are reduced along most of the observer angles on a plane in between two injector lines. A maximum noise reduction of about 3 dB is obtained along the direction of maximum sound propagation.",57,8
28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058016,"Noise-source identification using microphone arrays has become well-established in wind-tunnel testing. When the sources are moving, the accepted approach is first to “de-Dopplerize” the microphone signals, producing estimated source signals for subsequent analysis. A straightforward time-domain average of these signals is vulnerable to flow-noise contamination, and so an alternative approach is necessary for wind-tunnel applications. This method is equivalent to the basic, “diagonal-removal,” cross-spectral technique employed with fixed sources, but, unlike the fixed-source case, cannot be generalized to account simultaneously for multiple sources. The alternative presented here, which works with the time-domain cross-correlations between microphones, is not subject to this limitation. It is illustrated using simulated data from an example rotating-source configuration, and the results are compared against a de-Dopplerization-based analysis. For three equal-strength sources, the current method eliminates the contamination evident in de-Dopplerization estimates. Equally, it is able to locate and accurately characterize weak secondary sources that are masked by primary-source contributions in de-Dopplerization beamforming maps. Hence it extends the option of higher-fidelity wind-tunnel beamforming, currently only available for fixed sources, to rotating-source configurations.",57,8

A three-way spectral decomposition quantifies the contribution from each noise type in the sound of a tied-down F-35B aircraft on a linear ground-based array spanning 35–152 deg. This large spatial aperture allows for detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral models used in the decomposition capture the main features of the measured spectra with three exceptions: 1) that the F-35B engine noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) that the nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) that the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The F-35B broadband shock-associated noise has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. However, the peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale broadband shock-associated noise and those recently reported for the F/A-18E aircraft.

In general, the acoustic absorbing properties of liners and the resulting noise mitigation are affected by the presence of the boundary layer. The main goal of this study is to compare the effect of liner attenuation in the far field for different boundary conditions representing the liners, including uniform and shear flows, and consider typical turbofan geometry and operating conditions. For uniform flow cases, a reference solution was obtained from a finite element method code and used to validate the analytical model, which is based on the in-duct mode-matching technique and an analytic radiation model. For shear flow cases, the Brambley boundary condition and the solution to the Pridmore–Brown equation were considered; and the power transmission and modal decay rate along the duct were compared for increasing boundary-layer thickness. The transmitted modes were coupled to the radiation model based on the Kirchhoff integral approximation. The results suggest that the influence of the boundary-layer thickness can lead to a significant reduction on liner attenuation in some conditions. Moreover, it was observed in some cases that modal scattering produced by liner discontinuities results in a complex behavior (with the redistribution of the acoustic energy onto cut-on modes) in terms of noise radiation.",57,8

The thermal nonuniformity is generated by introducing a matched static pressure stream of low-temperature air into the subsonic, converging section of a round contoured supersonic nozzle. The secondary plume, which is offset radially from the geometric centerline of the round jet nozzle, produces a jet with an altered velocity profile, modifying the turbulence throughout the jet plume. On the side of the jet where the cooler stream is introduced, the near-nozzle peak velocity is reduced to 83% of the heated jet exit velocity, which is associated with a reduction in the measured peak turbulent stress levels in the region between three to six jet diameters from the nozzle exit. Several aspects of the mean flow and turbulence structure in the developing plume with temperature nonuniformity are similar to those seen in multistream coannular round jets with offset nozzles, indicating that alternative engineering approaches may be available for generating the characteristics of offset plumes desirable for jet noise reduction.",57,8
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058170,"This short note presents a new approach to estimate coefficients for gaseous jet loads at an inclined flat plate. These load coefficients are derived at the collisionless flow limit. The plate surface can be diffusive or specularly reflective and can have any irregular shapes, but for convenience a rectangular shape was used to demonstrate the work. The coefficients include total pressure, friction, heat flux, moment, and the distances from the pressure force to the plate centers. Direct simulation Monte Carlo simulations are performed to obtain the numerical coefficient results. When the Knudsen number is large, those coefficients are close to the exact solutions; when the number is small there are minor deviations. These coefficient formulas can provide quick references for the loads within a wide range of number, and they can significantly reduce or even completely eliminate simulations and measurements.",57,8
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057940,"Shock-wave–boundary-layer interaction is one of the most important phenomena in hypersonic flights due to its ubiquitous presence and its extreme effects on the aerothermodynamic loads on the aircraft surfaces. Low-frequency oscillations in separated flows in addition to high localized pressure and heat transfer as a result of such interactions make the ability to predict the flow with shock-wave–boundary-layer interaction highly essential in design of any hypersonic aircraft. To further investigate three-dimensional shock-wave–hypersonic-boundary-layer interaction, a cylindrically blunt fin–plate junction with three different sweep angles, 0, 22.5, and 45 deg, of the fin relative to the plate is chosen to numerically simulate. An MPI code written by the authors was used to solve the unsteady Navier–Stokes and ideal gas equations. The blunt fin shock wave with strength depending on the sweep angle of the fin interacts with the boundary layer on the plate and creates a separated region with a complex flow structure. The extent of the separated region decreases with increase in the sweep angle of the fin and decrease in the strength of the blunt fin shock wave. Localized high pressure forms at the reattachment point of the boundary layer by formation of a reattachment shock wave, with its maximum peak decreasing by increase in the sweep angle of the fin. The boundary-layer thickness on the blunt fin reaches its minimum at the reattachment point, where the heat transfer rate reaches its maximum value. Unsteady oscillations are observed in the 0 deg sweep angle configuration. The unsteady oscillations significantly subside with increase in the sweep angle of the fin. Time-averaged normalized heat transfer of the numerical simulations shows good agreement with the experimental data, except for the peak heat transfer for the 0 deg sweep angle case.",57,8
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057877,"This paper investigates the consistency and compatibility of various assumptions and strain measurements in a large displacements/geometric nonlinear analysis of beams and thin-walled structures. For this purpose, a refined beam model with enhanced three-dimensional accuracy is employed in a total Lagrangian scenario. This model is developed in the domain of the Carrera unified formulation, which allows expression of the nonlinear governing equations in terms of fundamental nuclei. These nuclei are independent of the theory approximation order; thus, low- to high-order theories of structures can be implemented with ease. Various numerical problems are addressed, and solutions are provided by using a classical finite element method and a Newton–Raphson linearization scheme. Given the intrinsic scalable nature of Carrera unified formulation, investigating the effects of the various nonlinear strain components is straightforward. It is demonstrated that the full Green–Lagrange strain tensor produces good approximation in case of large rotations, postbuckling, and nonlinear couplings. In contrast, approximations may be reasonable as moderate displacements and simpler problems (for example, slender beams under flexure) are considered.",57,8

From the finite element discretization, the semi-complementary energy is reconstructed in integral form. Analytical expressions for the exact and spurious terms are obtained. Using the elasticity solution for a simply supported plate, it is numerically shown that these spurious contributions do not significantly alter the quality of the approximation of the total level of energy, with overall excellent computational performance. On the other hand, when the starting functional is the strain energy and the principle of virtual displacement is adopted, the finite-element-introduced additional terms and in particular the contributions associated to the transverse shear stresses are demonstrated to add a very large error, which is a priori proven to be eliminated with selective integration. The presented technique could be extended to analyze the performance of other finite elements (e.g., higher-order triangular ones) within Reissner’s Mixed Variational Theorem and Generalized Unified Formulation.",57,8

38,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057777,"Topology optimization tools offer the potential to design novel aerospace structures that are subject to demanding strength and natural frequency requirements. However, algorithms for stress- and frequency-constrained topology optimization are more computationally expensive than compliance-based methods and are especially challenging to apply to large-scale high-resolution problems. To address this issue, stress constraints are formulated using a reconstruction of the displacement field that produces a stress field that is less mesh-sensitive and more amenable to stress-constrained optimization. To address the high computational cost of eigenvalue problems, the natural frequency problem is solved using a Jacobi–Davidson eigenvalue solution method that is compatible with iterative solution techniques. Novel eigenvector recycling strategies, which reuse eigenvector information, are proposed and evaluated. This combination of iterative eigenvalue solution method and recycling strategy enables the solution of high-resolution topology optimization problems with frequency constraints. The effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated by solving mass minimization problems with combined stress and frequency constraints on a cantilever beam problem with 42 million degrees of freedom, and on a new orthogonal bracket problem with 16 million degrees of freedom.",57,8

This study focuses on the frequency control of LaSMP-laminated simply supported thin plate by light-induced actuations. The governing equation of thin plate covered by LaSMP patch with arbitrary distribution is derived. The controlled frequency is solved numerically based on the Rayleigh–Ritz method and degenerates to an analytical solution of the fully laminated plate. The finite element method (FEM) is used to validate numerically solved analytical solutions, and FEM results are compared favorably with those solutions. Based on the numerical results of thin plate with partly covered LaSMP, the influences of LaSMP size and location on frequency control are investigated. The data suggest that the effect of frequency control is best when LaSMP is placed at the peak amplitude of the mode shapes with larger covering area. This study indicates that LaSMP can be a potential smart material for controlling frequency of thin plates by noncontact light actuations.",57,8
40,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058019,"Airborne wind energy (AWE) is a power production technique aiming to harvest energy from high-altitude winds through tethered aircraft. In the ground-based power generation concept, the aircraft flies dynamic trajectories at high flight speeds and lift coefficients, thus creating large lift forces. These forces drive a ground-based generator via a tether, thereby producing energy. The tethered aircraft operates over a wide range of wind speeds, with distinct operating modes. Current rigid-wing AWE aircraft adapt to these conditions by using discrete control surfaces. Morphing wings, in contrast, can adjust to the different flight conditions and operating modes by continuously altering their shape, and thus can increase the power production of AWE systems. This paper presents the modeling of a camber-morphing AWE system, focusing in particular on the coupled aeroelastics and flight dynamics of the aircraft and on the reduced-order structural and aerodynamic model of the morphing wing. The resulting framework allows analysis of the entire AWE system consisting of the aircraft, tether, and ground station. Owing to its high computational efficiency, the model enables comparison of different trajectories and flight control strategies, and it permits identification of optimal aerodynamic- and structural-design parameters of morphing AWE wings.",57,8

Generally, the existing exact methods for static reanalysis are only suitable for low-rank modifications. To combat this drawback, this paper presents a new exact method for structural static reanalysis based on flexibility disassembly perturbation. The proposed method is both exact and computationally efficient, and can be applied to many types of modifications in design, including low-rank modification, high-rank modification, small modification, and large modification.

42,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J058244,"The present work addresses a machine learning approach to study the linkage between deformation processing and microstructural texture evolution. The texture evolution is represented with a one-point probability descriptor, orientation distribution function (ODF) by employing a rate-independent single-crystal plasticity model. The ODF relates to the volume densities of different orientations in a microstructure, and thus it quantifies the texture during processing. First, a database of microstructural textures and deformation processes is built to generate the training dataset. The Latin hypercube sampling method is implemented to create uniformly distributed ODF values that represent the initial texture. Next, the crystal plasticity simulations using the initial ODF samples are performed for different deformation processes such as tension, plane strain compression, shear, shear, and shear; and the final texture information is stored in the database. Transductive learning is employed by using the training data to predict the label (optimum process) that can produce a given unlabeled texture. Two example process design applications are discussed for a galfenol alloy. In the first problem, the transductive learning approach is verified by using the previously optimized ODF solutions for a vibration tuning problem. In the second example, the process design is performed for a multiphysics optimization problem.",57,8
