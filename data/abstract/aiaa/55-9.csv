The result is a generalization of Merkin’s celebrated result on flutter instability in stable potential systems that are subjected to circulatory disturbances. Merkin’s result appears as a special case of the generalization obtained herein.,55,9

Successful design of a test article for a short-duration facility is difficult, especially when trying to guarantee establishment of the flow. Although this study does not detail the design methodologies of a test article, it does aim to provide better understanding of establishment metrics and predictive methods that have emerged from other studies in order to help in the design and assessment of experiments. Experimental and numerical data were taken at Mach 8.9 on an axisymmetric blunt-nosed body with an 8° flare and laminar boundary layer. It was shown that the global applicability of any single metric was poor; hence, an establishment criteria was developed for this study that provided a more global metric of establishment. Furthermore, a framework was provided for when the use of existing establishment metrics was appropriate.",55,9
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055333,"A dataset of normal shock trains in a rectangular cross-section channel has been created from direct numerical simulations in an effort to quantify the impact of inflow confinement ratio on the shock-train structure. To this end, the inlet boundary-layer momentum thickness was varied while the bulk inflow and outflow conditions remained constant. The simulations show that the shock train is displaced upstream as the inflow confinement ratio increases. Also, an increase in boundary-layer momentum thickness results in a reduction of the normal-like portion of the lambda-shock structures in the channel core. This leads to more numerous but weaker bifurcating shocks as well as an increase of the shock-train length. When the inflow boundary-layer thickness is varied temporally, the complex shock-train response depends on the excitation frequency. A resonant frequency is observed when different components of the shock train exhibit the highest amplification in terms of pressure jumps. Further, the domain upstream of the leading shock acts as a low-pass filter, which has the end result of limiting the axial shock-train motion. Nevertheless, even a small oscillation in boundary-layer momentum thickness of 0.45 mm (0.6% of the channel height) is seen to increase the shock-train length by two orders of magnitude (4 cm).",55,9
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055590,"This work is a fundamental investigation of the behavior of precombustion shock trains in the T4 Stalker Tube at the upper end of the dual-mode combustion regime. Experiments were conducted at a condition that represents flight at Mach 8 at an altitude of 26 km. The test model was a simple axisymmetric duct comprising a short diffuser, an isolator , and a constant-area combustor . Gaseous hydrogen was used as the fuel and was injected via six portholes equispaced around the perimeter of the duct. Time histories of the surface pressure in the model showed a pressure rise from stable supersonic combustion up to a fuel equivalence ratio of 0.9. At higher fuel levels, a precombustion shock train formed upstream of the point of fuel injection. Between equivalence ratios of 0.9 and 1.1, the shock train established itself and remained stable over a significant portion of the approximately 3 ms test window. Above an equivalence ratio of 1.1, the pressure time histories continued to rise throughout the test window and a stable flow was not established. These results indicate that short-duration facilities like the T4 Stalker Tube can be used for dual-mode combustion studies at fuel levels below a limit that will depend on the particular flow condition and model geometry.",55,9
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055672,"An experimental methodology for characterizing the available test gas slug is presented for a gas-driven shock tube. The method employs simple models for theoretical and experimental estimates of the available test gas slug at the time of interaction of the contact surface with the reflected shock wave, avoiding any direct measurement of driver gas in the tube. The measure of this interaction length is estimated against the primary shock Mach number over the entire operating range of a large-diameter shock tube. The trends of driver gas mixing show a strong relation to the theoretical predictions. The trends also suggest that mixing of the contact surface gases in the large shock tube is independent of driver gas composition and could depend largely on diaphragm opening times. The same analysis is also used on a smaller-diameter shock tube, in which resulting trends are readily explained by the known behavior of the contact surface from previous studies. The larger tube data also indicate a laminar boundary layer growth proportionality which can be used to reduce data further. This leads to available test gas slug quantification as a function of the produced shock Mach number alone. The experimental measurement requirements for this method are that of a regular shock tube calibration setup with wall-mounted pressure sensors, which makes it very convenient to implement in any shock tube for preliminary analysis.",55,9
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055592,"Shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions occurring in the inlets cause degradation of inlet efficiency. To better control these interactions and improve inlet performance, shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions need to be tested in supersonic wind tunnels in a region of clean, uniform flow. Wind tunnels used to study shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions generally have small rectangular test sections containing corner flow that affect the shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions. It is hypothesized that extending the width of the test section to increase the aspect ratio (test section inlet width to height ) may deter corner flow from influencing the centerline flow. This study uses a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes flow solver (Wind-US 3.0) with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model to investigate a normal shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction at Mach 1.6 in a 4.3-aspect-ratio test section. The analysis is focused on the spanwise composition of the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction, where results show the corner separation generates compression waves and reflected shocks, which disrupt spanwise uniformity. The geometric aspect ratio contributes to the placement and structure of the corner flow phenomena, which affects the intended shock structure across the centerline. A three-dimensional representation of the flowfield is produced, providing a cause-and-effect analysis of the three-dimensionality of the flow, which gives new, physical understanding of the shock and separation behavior in a large-aspect-ratio test section.",55,9
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055585,"Complex engine intakes are susceptible to unsteady flow distortions that may compromise the propulsion system operability. Hence, the need for high spatial and temporal resolution flow information is essential to aid the development of distortion-tolerant closely coupled propulsion systems. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry methods have been successfully applied to these flows, offering synchronous velocity datasets of high spatial resolution across the aerodynamic interface plane. However, the total pressure distortion measurements are still typically provided by low bandwidth intrusive total pressure rakes of low spatial resolution, which results in limited characterization of the total pressure distortion. This limitation can potentially be addressed by pressure field reconstruction from non-intrusive high resolution velocity data. A range of reconstruction methods is assessed based on representative data from steady and unsteady computational simulations of an S-duct configuration. In addition to the reconstructed total pressure field, the impact on the key distortion metrics is assessed. The effect of the Mach number is considered. Overall, the reconstruction methods show that the distortion metrics can be determined with sufficient accuracy to indicate that there is a potential benefit from exploiting high resolution velocity measurements in evaluating total pressure distortion.",55,9
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055735,"The unthrottled flows in curved isolators are studied experimentally and numerically. Wind-tunnel tests are conducted at a freestream Mach number of 4.92. The internal flowfield is visualized and measured. Large-scale separation bubbles in the inlet are observed, and the downstream duct curvature is found to be able to decrease the separation bubble size via lowering the local pressure downstream of the separation bubble. Complex background waves appear in these isolators, and the increase of duct curvature tends to intensify the reflected shocks. Particularly, the strength distributions along the shock direction of the background shocks behave differently under the influence of duct curvature. For the right-running shocks, the strength distribution changes from a descending trend to an ascending trend with the increase of duct curvature, whereas the strength of left-running shocks always descends with an increasing speed. The strength of background shocks is particularly related to the left-running expansion waves, which get intensified and become the dominant expansion waves in the isolators as the duct curvature increases. The schlieren images indicate a significant transverse density gradient and pressure gradient in the curved isolators. The wall pressure distributions further show that the radial pressure gradient in small curvature isolators switches between centripetal and centrifugal repeatedly; whereas it remains centripetal consistently in large curvature isolators, which is also determined by the left-running expansion waves. As a result, the secondary flow gets stronger as the duct curvature increases, resulting in a larger low-momentum flow region near the bottom wall. In general, the compression capability of the isolator gets attenuated with the increase of the duct curvature.",55,9
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055042,"Aircraft morphing provides advantages to traditional flight including drag reduction and maneuverability. Previous research indicates that smooth spanwise transitions in trailing-edge camber, representative of a biological analog, provide aerodynamic benefits at small angles of attack by eliminating vortices at geometric discontinuities but lack nonlinear aerodynamic investigations. This work aims to analyze the adaptability of a spanwise morphing wing concept with respect to nonlinear aerodynamics using an optimized nonlinear extended lifting-line model. In this novel approach, it is shown that adaptation, including stall recovery, can be achieved solely through geometric tailoring as opposed to attitude correction for a range of flight conditions while reducing the drag penalty associated with operating at the unadapted condition. The range of conditions for which the wing can recover are restricted by the limited trailing-edge deflections and the inability of the actuators to substantially shift the stall angle of the section lift curve. These results provide insight into improving morphing wing designs, indicating that, by adding another degree of freedom to the chordwise deformation such as a morphing hinge capable of larger actuation and reflex camber, stall recovery via geometric tailoring may be feasible for an even larger range of conditions.",55,9
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055721,"The single-shooting method is used to identify optimal maneuvers in the lateral dynamics of a partially supported flexible wing. The aim is to identify efficient actuation strategies from a fully coupled nonlinear aeroelastic/flight-dynamics model, which accounts for potentially large wing deflections, to improve vehicle maneuverability. The flexible vehicle dynamics is described using a geometrically exact composite beam on a body-attached frame and an unsteady vortex lattice with arbitrary kinematics of the lifting surfaces. Rolling maneuvers are obtained through optimal control. A flight-dynamics model based on elasticized stability derivatives is used as a reference, and it is shown to capture the relevant dynamics either under slow actuation or for stiff wings. Embedding the full aeroelastic description into the optimization framework expands the space of achievable maneuvers, such as quick wing response with low structural vibrations or large lateral forces with minimal lift losses. It is also seen to provide a general methodology to identify unconventional maneuvers that use large wing geometry changes to meet multiple simultaneous control objectives.",55,9
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055461,"The wing rock induced by forebody vortices was investigated experimentally for a wing–body at high angles of attack, and the emphasis was put on the effects of Reynolds number on motion patterns. The results indicate that, if the boundary layers of the forebody exhibit laminar separation, the wing–body can regularly experience various motion types, as a tip perturbation changes its circumferential positions around the nose tip. After transition separation of boundary layers occurs, however, the effects of the tip perturbation on the motion types are alleviated progressively with increasing Reynolds number. Eventually, the wing-rock motions are independent on the tip perturbation, and the model always exhibits limit-cycle oscillations regardless of where the perturbation is located. In the case of fully turbulent separation, simulated by transition wires, the dominant roles of the tip perturbation on wing-rock types are recovered, in which the motion patterns of wing rock regularly vary with variation of the tip perturbation. Pressure distributions on the forebody and wings during a forced oscillation reveal that forebody and wing vortices apparently exhibit dynamic hysteresis. The associated flow mechanisms for sustaining the wing rock were analyzed based on static particle image velocimetry, and static- and dynamic-pressure measurements.",55,9
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055670,"In this study, the effectiveness of repetitive laser pulse energy deposition over a double-cone model in a Mach 1.92 flow (half-apex angles of 22 and 40 deg) was investigated experimentally. The Reynolds number, based on the model’s outer diameter, was . Because of the shock wave/boundary-layer interaction, the shock wave over the cone’s transition corner exhibited an inherent low-frequency oscillation with a characteristic frequency of 6.3 kHz. Using high-frequency laser deposition of up to 80 kHz, the oscillation of the shock system was suppressed. Although the boundary layer experienced “sweeping” by laser-heated rings with a primary frequency equal to that of the energy deposition, the shock system above the bubble passage experienced frequency modulation to a much lower frequency range, and the shock wave location was stabilized.",55,9
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055700,"This work documents high-speed wind-tunnel experiments conducted on a pitching airfoil equipped with an array of combustion-powered actuators. The main objective of these experiments was to demonstrate the stall-suppression capability of combustion-powered actuators on a high-lift rotorcraft airfoil (the VR-12) at relevant Mach numbers. Through unsteady pressure measurements at the airfoil surface, it was shown that combustion-powered actuators could positively affect the stall behavior of the VR-12 at Mach numbers up to 0.4. Static airfoil results demonstrated 25 and 50% increases in poststall lift at Mach numbers of 0.4 and 0.3, respectively. Deep dynamic stall results showed cycle-averaged lift coefficient increases up to 11% at Mach 0.4. Furthermore, it was shown that these benefits could be achieved with relatively few pulses during the downstroke and with no need to preanticipate the stall event. The flow mechanisms responsible for stall suppression were investigated using particle image velocimetry. The flow structures found at these Mach numbers appeared to be very similar to the flow structures noted previously at very low Mach numbers.",55,9
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055009,"This paper presents the development of an accurate and robust discrete adjoint approach for the optimization of active flow control mechanism. The adjoint solver is developed by applying algorithmic differentiation techniques to an incompressible unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solver. Coupled with a quasi-Newton gradient-search optimization algorithm, its applicability is demonstrated by finding the optimal synthetic jet actuation on the suction side of the NACA 4412 airfoil at a Reynolds number and angle of incidence of 20 deg. Numerical results have shown that the actuation sensitivities based on the unsteady discrete adjoint solver are in excellent agreement with the values obtained from the tangent-linear solver and finite differences. Compared to the stalled baseline flow, optimal actuated flow significantly increased the time-averaged lift by 54%, and the stall is delayed from 16 to 22 deg. A detailed analysis of sensitivities and the effect of optimal actuation on the separation is presented.",55,9
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055824,"An improved immersed boundary method for turbulent flow simulation on Cartesian grids is proposed. To determine the appropriate boundary conditions, near-wall approximation of the mean-flow equation and the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model is investigated. A modified near-wall velocity profile that is linear with respect to the distance from the wall and that can be resolved by a numerical scheme with second-order spatial accuracy is derived. As with the velocity profile, the eddy-viscosity profile is modified to maintain the balance of the shear stress. To obtain the modified profile as a numerical solution, the boundary condition for the tangential velocity and the damping function in the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model is modified. Verification studies defined in the NASA Turbulence Modeling Resource are conducted. In all cases, the results confirm that the modified immersed boundary method produces a more accurate prediction of skin friction than the original immersed boundary method and show a consistent trend of grid convergence.",55,9
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055711,"A single-point transition closure model that incorporates analytical results by stability theory in a reasonably wide range of Mach numbers has been formulated for supersonic/hypersonic boundary-layer flows, which includes two transport equations to specify the transition onset locations: one for the eddy-viscosity coefficient of laminar fluctuations and another for intermittency factor. The effects of compressibility are modeled through solutions of laminar self-similar boundary layer at subsonic and supersonic conditions with a totally local closure. Then, to form a complete transition turbulence model, the proposed transition model is coupled with the compressible shear-stress transport turbulence model. In the end, several sets of well-documented flow cases are chosen to validate the present transition model, and the results are in satisfactory accord with experimental data. Proven by the numerical tests, the present model is capable of predicting well the supersonic/hypersonic transition onset that is dominated by the first and second Mack instability modes and laminar separation mode.",55,9

It is shown that the effect of under- and overtripping is to amplify the wake component of the mean velocity profile and outer-layer turbulence intensity, confirming trends from incompressible flow. Such results indicate that overly aggressive tripping introduces artificial large-scale turbulence that requires longer downstream distances to decay. For the current experiment, adequate tripping was obtained for trip sizes between 1.7 and 2.3 times the laminar boundary-layer displacement thickness at the trip, , with the optimum size approximately 2.3 . The wake strength for the optimally tripped cases followed the correlation of Fernholz and Finley (AGARDograph 253, Neuilly sur Seine, France, 1980) at the same Reynolds number, providing a good indicator for under- or overtripping. These results confirm that compressible boundary layers mimic incompressible trends but require larger trip sizes and have increased sensitivity, making a boundary layer free from initial conditions harder to achieve.",55,9
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055645,"A new method based on reduced-order modeling is presented for the purpose of accelerating the convergence of an iterative solver via solution prediction in the framework of a computational fluid dynamics solver. Using a number of flow solutions as snapshots at preconvergent iterations of the explicit time-marching solver, the reduced-order-modeling-based acceleration technique is used to project to a more accurate solution. The method is first applied to accelerate the convergence of an incompressible Navier–Stokes solver, and the classical two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow case is revisited for this purpose. Next, the proposed convergence acceleration technique is used in the framework of a density-based computational fluid dynamics solver, and subsonic as well as transonic (inviscid) flows over the NACA 0012 airfoil are studied. Additionally, the performance of the proposed convergence acceleration technique is investigated for turbulent transonic flow over the RAE 2822 airfoil.",55,9

This method allows for the generation of near-body and offbody grids in one piece at the same phase to avoid mesh quality problems in transition areas. Different from most curved viscous mesh-generation approaches, this method is direct by using a simple vector-adding approach, which obviates a linear or nonlinear-elasticity analogy but still provides highly probable positive-Jacobian mesh elements. In addition, transformation from linear to curved meshes can be achieved by only deforming the necessary edges of the elements near domain boundaries while retaining the remaining noncurved edges to benefit the numerical simulation solvers.",55,9
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055647,"An accurate prediction of the tip vortex flowfield is required to understand the viscous interactions of the rotor wake and ground prevalent during helicopter brownout. To achieve this goal, a compressible, structured, overset Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based solver is used to simulate a subscale rotor in ground effect. Novel mesh-gridding techniques are used to avoid prohibitive computational costs. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations solved with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model show that a smeared-out flowfield at an early wake ages due to excessive turbulence levels. To further investigate that the source of a smeared rotor wake is the use of turbulence modeling, the computations are performed with laminar flow assumption that show a preserved rotor wake field for longer wake ages. However, an accurate understanding of the cause of brownout requires an accurate prediction of turbulence levels. Therefore, a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes/large-eddy simulation methodology such as delayed detached-eddy simulation is explored. The flowfield obtained from the delayed detached-eddy simulation methodology still does not preserve the rotor wake. Because the wake capturing grids are highly anisotropic, a modified length scaling is used. The delayed detached-eddy simulation-based length scale with correction for anisotropic grids helps in preserving the rotor wake and shows a close agreement with experimental results.",55,9

The turbulence model blends a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-type closure near solid walls with a subgrid model in the freestream based on the ratios of estimated inner and outer turbulent length scales. The cavity geometry is modeled using an immersed boundary method, and an auxiliary flat-plate simulation is performed to replicate the effects of the wind-tunnel boundary layer on the computed optical path difference. Two-dimensional proper orthogonal decomposition modes of the optical wave front are computed; these compare favorably with wind-tunnel data, despite uncertainties about inflow turbulence levels and boundary-layer thicknesses over the wind-tunnel window. Dynamic mode decomposition of a planar wave front spanning the entire cavity reveals that wave-front distortions are driven by shear-layer oscillation at the Rossiter frequencies; these disturbances create eddy shocklets that propagate into the freestream and create additional optical path disturbances.",55,9

The formulation is based on full-conservation laws and accommodates real-fluid thermodynamics and transport theories over the entire range of fluid states of concern. Liquid oxygen at 120 K is injected into a supercritical oxygen environment at 300–600 K. Detailed three-dimensional flow structures are visualized for the first time in the pressure range of 100–200 atm. A smooth fluid transition from the compressed-liquid to light-gas state occurs, which is in contrast to a distinct interface of phase change at subcritical pressure. Dynamic behaviors of the oscillatory flowfield are explored using the spectral analysis and proper orthogonal decomposition technique. Various underlying mechanisms dictating flow evolution, including shear-layer, helical, centrifugal, and acoustic instabilities, are studied in depth. The hydrodynamic wave motions in the liquid-oxygen film are found to propagate in two different modes: one along the axial direction at the local wave speed; the other in the azimuthal direction and convected downstream at the mean flow velocity. Results show good agreement with the analytical prediction of the overall response transfer function of the swirl injector. The dominant mode of the azimuthal wave is triggered by the natural acoustic oscillation within the injector. Compared with the two-dimensional axisymmetric results, the calculated liquid-oxygen film is thicker and the spreading angle smaller due to the momentum loss and vortical dynamics in the azimuthal direction.",55,9
23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J055854,"Helmholtz resonators are commonly used to damp thermoacoustic oscillations in aeroengine and gas turbine combustors. In practice, the Helmholtz resonator is often maintained at a cooler temperature than the combustor, but this tends to be neglected when modeling. In this work, we derive an analytical model for both the acoustic damping and the effect on the combustor thermoacoustics of Helmholtz resonators for which the volume is at a different temperature to the combustor. The energy conservation equation based on stagnation enthalpy, together with the mass and momentum conservation equations, is incorporated into a linear Helmholtz resonator sound-absorption model. These are coupled with linear wave-based models for the plane acoustic waves in the system to which the Helmholtz resonator is attached: here, a combustor. The temperature difference is found to generate an entropy wave that advects downstream of the resonator (and may generate further acoustic waves if accelerated) and to change the acoustic damping near the resonant frequency. This model for the Helmholtz resonator acoustics is then incorporated into a low-order network model for combustor thermoacoustics. The importance of capturing the effect of the Helmholtz resonator temperature difference on the overall thermoacoustic modes is clearly demonstrated.",55,9

The highlight is an analytical uncertainty quantification model via a Gaussian distribution to model propagation of microstructural uncertainties to the properties. A metallic microstructure is represented using a finite element discretized form of the orientation distribution function. A stochastic optimization approach is proposed that employs the analytical model for uncertainty quantification, to maximize the yield strength of Galfenol microstructure in a compliant beam when constrained by uncertainties in the designed natural frequency of vibration.

A strain-actuated solar array enables attitude slewing maneuvers and precision pointing (image acquisition) stares, while simultaneously suppressing structural vibrations. Distributed piezoelectric actuators help achieve higher precision, higher bandwidth, and quieter operation than reaction wheels. To understand the design tradeoffs for this architecture, a framework for the integrated design of distributed structural geometry and distributed control is presented. The physical properties of the array are modeled and designed with respect to a piecewise linear distributed thickness profile. The distributed control is a voltage profile across the array modeled as a spatially continuous function. The dynamics of the system are modeled using a coupled ordinary differential equation–partial differential equation system using extended generalizations for hybrid coordinate systems. The combined physical and control system design, or co-design problem is investigated to understand the optimal performance of the system. Single-axis slew maneuvers of 7.2 milliradians or 1485 arcsec are achieved for a representative spacecraft model without increasing array mass or reducing array planform area. From additional tradeoff studies, a design criteria is revealed for the array structure and control strategy based on the optimal design tradeoff between large array inertia and fast structural dynamics.

However, the current state of the art about pillow distortion have great limitations in practical application, because they are mostly based on the assumptions that the stress applied on the mesh membrane is uniformly distributed and that the reflector is segmented into regular convex polygons by cable net. To improve the applicability and simplicity of the current state of the art, an alternative approach has been developed for the pillow disstortion analysis of space mesh reflector antennas without limiting assumptions in this paper. First of all, the triangular and quadrilateral cable-membrane elements are selected as conventional base units for space mesh reflector antennas. Second, equations and the calculation method were derived to investigate the pillow distortion of space mesh reflector antennas composed of triangular cable-membrane elements, based on the differential equations of membranes and cables, and then extended for that composed of other polygonal elements. To verify the validity and robustness of the proposed analytical method, some cable-membrane elements and a space mesh reflector antenna were taken as numerical examples. Eventually, the surface error distribution, root mean square error, and far-field electrical performance of an antenna influenced by the pillow distortion were conducted.",55,9
