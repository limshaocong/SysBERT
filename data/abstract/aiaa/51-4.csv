A fine description of the buffet characteristics in the uncontrolled configuration is first given as a reference. Various steady and unsteady measurement techniques on the model surface and into the flowfield are used to perform a detailed analysis of the buffet phenomenon. The flow separation between the shock foot and the wing trailing edge being the cause of buffet, mechanical, continuous, and pulsed fluidic vortex generators are located upstream of the shock foot to reduce the extent of this separated area. As far as fluidic actuators are concerned several momentum coefficients, spanwise spacing, and orientations of the jets have been tested, while the effect of the actuation frequency is studied for the pulsed jets. Fluidic actuators, as well as mechanical ones, have been proved to be very efficient to postpone the buffet onset.",51,4
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J050653,"In this work, large-eddy simulation is used to study the flow around a circular cylinder undergoing streamwise sinusoidal oscillations. This benchmark case is a first step toward studying engineering applications related to flow-induced vibrations. Both the flow physics, which correlate the flow development with the time varying loading of the cylinder at two different oscillation frequencies, as well as a validation of the fluid structure interaction methodology through comparison with experimental data for the same configuration are described. With the methodology used, large-eddy simulation based on a finite volume method capable of handling moving meshes gives force predictions that generally agree well with experimentally measured data, both with respect to the overall flow development as with force magnitude.",51,4
2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051545,A hybrid finite-element/finite-volume node-pair discretization of conservation laws is reformulated in terms of a Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook kinetic scheme to address flows from the continuum up to the transitional regime in a seamless fashion. Integrals of the particle distribution function from the kinetic theory of gases are adopted to compute the numerical fluxes along the boundary of each control volume. Flow features typical of the transitional regime like velocity and temperature slip condition at solid walls are automatically assured by the kinetic formulation of the node-pair boundary conditions. Exemplary two-dimensional numerical experiments ranging from continuum flows up to the transitional regime are presented.,51,4
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051607,"A surrogate modeling strategy, using effective interpolation and sampling methods, facilitates a reduction in the number of computational fluid dynamics simulations required to construct an aerodynamic model to a specified accuracy. In this paper, two adaptive sampling strategies are compared for generating surrogate models, based on Kriging and radial basis function interpolation, respectively. The relationships between the two model formulations are discussed, and three test cases are considered, including analytic functions and recovery of aerodynamic coefficients for two example applications: longitudinal flight mechanics analysis for the DLR-F12 aircraft and structural loads analysis of an RAE2822 airfoil. For the airfoil example, models of , , and were constructed with the two sampling strategies using Euler/boundary-layer-coupled computational fluid dynamics and a three-dimensional flight envelope of incidence, Mach, and Reynolds number. The two sampling approaches direct some samples toward exploration of the domain by minimizing model uncertainty and some toward refinement of local nonlinearities, by adapting to model curvature or extrema. The results provide some evidence that, for certain functions, in certain scenarios, each update scheme could be useful. Both methods were at least better than traditional space-filling sampling for all the test cases presented.",51,4
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051620,"A study is presented of the effect of pulsation (100% modulation) of a sonic jet of helium into a supersonic (ducted) crossflow on its mixing. An injector was developed to provide a high-speed high-frequency (up to 13 kHz) pulsed jet. The injector nozzle is formed between fixed internal passages and a three- or four-sided wheel embedded within the device that rotates due to the flow in the nozzle. For a given geometry the pulsation frequency is repeatable, constant above a certain pressure ratio, and scales with the speed of sound of the gas. The pulsed jet in the crossflow was visualized in a side view by schlieren photography. The plume of injected helium was visualized in a cross section, 69 effective jet diameters downstream of injection, by seeding the helium with a small amount of ethanol, which condensed as tiny particles and illuminated with a laser light sheet. Results indicate a modest reduction in mean plume cross-sectional size (and, therefore, reduction of mixing) with pulsation and an increase in mean helium penetration. The visualization results are consistent with a transitional state between the turbulent puffs and vortex rings previously observed in low-speed experiments on subsonic pulsed jets in crossflow.",51,4
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051683,"Unsteady aerodynamic loads were measured on a NACA 0021 airfoil during rapid flap deflections. Typical dynamic-stall effects like an overshoot in lift, drag, and pitching moment have been observed in the absence of active flow control. Final flap-deflection angles and the rate of their deflections were varied at a constant angle of attack. Stall prevention or delay was achieved by fluidic actuators that generated discrete sweeping jets over the upper surface of a deflected simple flap. Static experiments proved the effectiveness of these actuators in preventing flow separation, thus increasing the lift and decreasing the drag of the airfoil. Dynamic tests proved their efficacy in dynamic stall. A significant gain in lift and a substantial reduction in drag were achieved within a short time period, even when the flap deflection was high.",51,4
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051678,"The application of a planar density measurement technique for compressible flowfields based on acetone planar laser-induced fluorescence is presented. An error analysis indicates a minimum inherent uncertainty of in density measurements due to uncertainty in local pressure and a total experimental uncertainty of 8%, primarily driven by shot noise due to low-signal levels. The technique is demonstrated through the visualization of the separated shear layer and turbulent wake of a wall-mounted hemisphere at a freestream Mach number of 0.78 and a Reynolds number of approximately 900,000. The flow is marked by a large-scale flapping motion of the wake and low-density vortex cores, where density drops of up to 50% of the freestream density are detected. In addition, closeup images of the shear layer near the separation point reveal the formation of lambda shocks. The density fields are used to perform aerooptic distortion calculations through spatial integration of the density field. A correlation is found between the spatial scale of the distortion and the features present in the density field. These findings demonstrate the viability of acetone planar laser-induced fluorescence for conducting planar density measurements and providing a new method for the evaluation of aerooptic distortion in compressible flows.",51,4
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051750,"A model of thermal stress field from literature with temperature-dependent thermophysical properties is updated using an appropriate expression of thermal strain due to free thermal expansion. The thermal shock resistance of the ultra-high-temperature ceramic plate under aerodynamic thermal environments is then studied by combining the proposed analytical method of heat for thermal shock. The numerical simulation is conducted to examine the theoretical model. The results from the model agree well with those from the simulation. The study shows that for the given material and thermal shock initial temperature the same heat transfer condition (product of surface heat flux and plate thickness) results in the same critical failure temperature difference. The critical failure time is inversely proportional to the square of the surface heat flux and is proportional to the square of the plate thickness, that is, the ultra-high-temperature ceramic plate has the same critical failure dimensionless time. The thermal shock resistance of ultra-high-temperature ceramics decreases as the heat transfer condition increases. The critical heat transfer condition is introduced to characterize the thermal shock resistance of ultra-high-temperature ceramics similar to using the strength in representing the fracture-resistance ability of the materials.",51,4
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051761,"The modeling of bombardment ejections, as they affect the uplift of dust particles and the formation of a brownout dust cloud generated by a rotorcraft in ground effect operations, is discussed. Bombardment ejections take place when a previously suspended particle in the flow collides with a sediment bed and ejects many more particles, leaving a crater behind. A model, based in part from research in aeolian sediment transport, was developed to better represent the mechanisms of bombardment-induced particle ejections during rotorcraft brownout conditions. This method was then coupled to a Lagrangian solver for the rotor flow and a Lagrangian particle dynamics simulation. It is shown how bombardment can play a critical role in the uplift and entrainment of smaller-sized particles from the underlying bed below a rotor. In particular, it is shown how the rotor blade tip vortices and/or regions of flow recirculation near the rotor can eject many particles by bombardment, resulting in the rapid development of intense dust clouds. The formation of vortex wake bundling ahead of the rotor disk was shown to provide the conditions particularly ripe for the ejection and uplift of large quantities of dust particles by means of bombardment mechanisms.",51,4
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051741,"An -multipole particle-condensation method is proposed to spatially condense the volumetric quadrupole sources based on Lighthill’s acoustic analogy that are extracted from computational-fluid-dynamics data. The purpose of the method is to reduce both the amount of data that must be stored during the computational-fluid-dynamics analysis and the number of acoustic sources driving the subsequent acoustic-propagation analysis, while preserving the accuracy of the predicted sound pressure field. The method uses a particle approximation of the quadrupole source distribution and employs a Taylor series expansion of the harmonic Green’s function to spatially condense the underlying acoustic sources and preserve their multipole moments. Low-Mach-number flow around rigid-walled stationary bodies in a medium at rest at infinity is used to demonstrate the -multipole particle-condensation method. The directivity of the sound pressure field due to the quadrupole sources is presented for the first four harmonics of the vortex-shedding frequency for flow past a circular cylinder with Reynolds number and Mach number . Using the -multipole particle-condensation method, the number of acoustic sources is reduced by a factor of 120 with the associated far-field sound pressure levels within 0.5 dB of the noncondensed results for all four harmonics.",51,4
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051765,"Closed-form algebraic expressions for the energy-release rate and the mode mixity are obtained for a debonded sandwich (trimaterial). The most general case of an “asymmetric” sandwich is considered (i.e., the bottom face sheet not necessarily of the same material or thickness as the top face sheet). The energy-release rate is obtained by use of the J-integral, and the expression is derived in terms of the forces and moments at the debond section. Regarding the mode mixity, a closed-form expression is derived in terms of the geometry, material, and applied loading, and it is proven that, in the trimaterial case, just as in the bimaterial case, the mode mixity can be obtained in terms of a single scalar quantity , which is independent of loading; the value for a particular geometry and material can be extracted from a numerical solution for one loading combination. Thus, this analysis extends the existing formulas in the literature, which are for either a delamination in a homogeneous composite or an interface crack in a bimaterial. These new “trimaterial with a crack” formulas are also proven to yield the formulas for the limits of a bimaterial or for a homogeneous section with a crack.",51,4
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051789,"A compressible, structured, overset Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based solver is used to simulate a microhovering rotor in ground effect to demonstrate the capability of the code to provide accurate tip-vortex-flowfield predictions, and to provide a good understanding of the ground–wake interactions in conditions prevalent in helicopter brownout. The performance validation at different rotor heights above the ground shows good correlation with the experimental thrust and power measurements. A detailed comparison of the predicted tip-vortex flowfield shows good agreement with the vorticity contours and radial-velocity profiles obtained from the particle-image-velocimetry measurements during experiments. The examination of the in ground effect tip-vortex flowfield suggests high degree of instabilities close to the ground. The induced velocities arising from the proximity of the rotor tip vortices cause flow separation at the ground. An analysis of the eddy-viscosity contours near the ground indicates higher turbulence levels in the flowfield at smaller rotor heights above the ground. With a decreasing rotor height, the increased interactions between the tip vortices and the ground boundary layer result in the intermixing of eddy viscosity from the tip vortex to the ground boundary layer.",51,4
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051817,"The extension of the surrogate-based recurrence framework approach to account for time-varying swept flow effects under dynamic stall conditions is described. Using full-order solutions generated by the OVERFLOW computational fluid dynamics code, the surrogate-based recurrence framework reduced-order modeling approach is shown to effectively mimic full-order solutions of unsteady lift, moment, and drag under dynamic stall conditions while maintaining the computational efficiency associated with semiempirical dynamic stall models. This level of functionality represents a new capability for rotary-wing aeroelasticity applications. Furthermore, a generalized kriging formulation based on nonstationary Gaussian process modeling is implemented in a tractable manner by locally optimizing the high-dimensional likelihood function in the vicinity of the stationary solution. The resulting nonstationary covariance structures are shown to significantly improve the accuracy of the surrogate-based recurrence framework predicted moment stall characteristics compared to a stationary model. It is shown that the nonstationary surrogate-based recurrence framework approach is better able to adapt to abrupt changes in airload behavior caused by the underlying dynamic stall vortex dynamics. The results indicate that the surrogate-based recurrence framework approach based on nonstationary Gaussian process models is a promising alternative to widely used semiempirical rotorcraft dynamic stall models that cannot account for the effects of time-varying velocity components associated with forward flight.",51,4
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051853,"Renewed interest in flow-control devices using various forms of plasmas has motivated the design and systematic investigation of localized arc-filament plasma actuators. This newly constructed system creates electric arcs by generating electric fields in the range of between two pin-type electrodes. The potential of the actuator to influence surrounding quiescent air when placed in a cavity was investigated using emission imaging, particle image velocimetry, and current and voltage measurements. The emission imaging showed both temporal and spatial variation. The emission was most intense and variable in the first microsecond after breakdown. The particle-image-velocimetry data were acquired for several plasma currents, on times, and actuation frequencies. The data showed characteristic features of a hot gas expansion from a cavity, such as rapid gas dilatation exemplified through a blast wave, and cavity refilling from postdischarge cooling. The electric measurements were correlated to their respective emission imaging and particle-image-velocimetry measurements. The plasma voltage was found to alternate between two distinct modes: high-voltage and low-voltage. From the emission imaging, it is theorized that this actually may be the plasma alternating between glow and arc discharge modes as a result of the restricted current.",51,4
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051773,"The present paper addresses the issue of direct simulation of complex local failure patterns in laminated composites. A model capable of the discrete modeling of matrix cracking, delamination, and the interaction of these two damage modes is proposed. The analytical technique develops the regularized extended finite element method for the simulation of matrix crack initiation and propagation at initially unknown locations, as well as a cohesive interface model for delamination. The regularized extended finite element method preserves the Gaussian integration schema in each element regardless of the enrichment required to model cracking and is capable of representing the complex kinematics of crack networks in composite laminates. The technique uses independently measured standard ply-level mechanical properties of the unidirectional composite (stiffness, strength, fracture toughness). Failure simulations of composites containing open holes are presented. Although the process of crack initiation is impossible to capture precisely due to local material variations the proposed method exhibits excellent agreement with experimental data for matrix and delamination crack growth in quasi-isotropic open hole graphite-epoxy composites with thick plies, where the composite fails in the delamination failure mode.",51,4
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051877,"Steady and unsteady three-dimensional viscous turbulent aero-icing simulations are computationally expensive, especially for certification campaigns when broad parametric studies are needed. To overcome the computational effort of such investigations, a Reduced Order Modeling approach, based on Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and Kriging interpolation, is proposed. Using a database of high-fidelity numerical simulations, experimental data, or combinations of both, the proposed technique allows approximating solutions by linear combination of a limited number of eigenfunctions. Bayesian Kriging, a recent variant, is used to obtain the scalar coefficients for the expansion. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed against reference solutions from two- and three-dimensional aero-icing simulations as well as against experimental data.",51,4
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052159,"The counteraction of changing environmental conditions (i.e., changes of pressure level and airflow speed) on the resulting plasma-actuator performance is demonstrated in the present work. The impact of these changing (fluctuating and/or transient) airflow conditions on the performance of dielectric-barrier-discharge plasma actuators is suppressed using a novel closed-loop performance-control procedure. The goal of controlling a preset plasma-actuator performance online and in situ is achieved and successfully demonstrated. This novel approach represents the first step toward optimal-discharge-based flow control because, beyond the common purpose of favorably manipulating the airflow, any advanced dielectric-barrier-discharge-based flow-control system will necessarily require an appropriate closed-loop performance control of the discharge device.",51,4
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052213,"Two high-lift mechanisms, namely, convected leading-edge vortices and stable deflected jets, have previously been identified for an airfoil undergoing small-amplitude plunging oscillations. In this paper the effect of geometry is investigated through direct comparison of the forces and flowfields associated with small-amplitude plunging oscillations of a NACA 0012 airfoil and a flat plate for 0 deg and a poststall angle of attack of 15 deg with a Reynolds number of 10,000. For 0 deg at high Strouhal numbers, the NACA airfoil experiences stable deflected jets responsible for very large lift coefficients, whereas the flat plate experiences deflected jets that are prone to periodic oscillation in direction, resulting in oscillation of the lift coefficient with a period on the order of 100 cycles. It is postulated that this jet switching is driven by the leading-edge vortex (LEV). At 15 deg angle of attack, the flat plate is shown to produce a comparable increase in lift up to a Strouhal number of unity, but after this, the lift performance deteriorates. This is due to the leading-edge vortices convecting further from the upper surface. At higher plunge velocities, a new mode of LEV behavior is observed. The upper-surface LEV pairs with the lower-surface LEV to form a dipole that convects against the freestream and is rapidly dissipated. This results in a highly separated time-averaged flow, and thus in low lift and high drag.",51,4
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J052165,"The present work investigates the natural low-frequency flow oscillation phenomenon using large-eddy simulation. Four simulations were carried out for flow around a NACA 0012 airfoil with Reynolds number of 50,000 and Mach number at angles of attack of 9.25, 9.29, 9.4, and 9.6 deg. The results clearly indicate that natural low-frequency flow oscillation is taking place. The oscillations are self-sustained and caused by periodic bubble forming and bubble bursting on the suction side. The low-frequency oscillation phenomenon was found to exist over a range of angles of attack near stall. Computed maximum reverse flow inside the bubble indicates an absolute instability mechanism. The time- and span-averaged flowfield as well as the instantaneous turbulent flowfield illustrated the dynamics of low-frequency oscillation near stall. The location of transition is shown to move downstream during bubble bursting. Spectral analysis of the surrounding acoustic field reveals that the observed phenomenon affects the circulation around the entire airfoil. Analysis of the flowfield led to the proposition of a mechanism for low-frequency flow oscillations near stall in which the separated shear layers from the leading edge and the trailing edge play a major role in driving the separated flow to reattachment.",51,4
