The computation captures a nondelayed development of unsteady structures at the beginning of the separation and accurately resolves the energy cascade in the fully turbulent mixing layer over a large frequency range. A comparison with the experimental data shows that the zonal detached-eddy simulation approach clearly improves the prediction of the mean flow, whereas classical Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes methods usually fail. A spectral analysis of pressure signals highlights the origin and the characteristics of the various unsteady mechanisms involved in this complex flow.",53,11
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J051614,"A partitioned solution framework is developed for time-domain aerothermoelastic simulation of hypersonic vehicles. The motivation for development of such an approach stems from the fact that hypersonic vehicles consist of multiple substructures, each containing different dominant physics. Different model forms are therefore required to capture the main physics of each substructure, and direct coupling of the various substructures of the vehicle is not straightforward. The methodology of this paper is based on a partitioned time-marching formulation, in which individual components of the vehicle are modeled separately, and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the systems within each time step. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the substructures, therefore allowing for the models to be of dissimilar form. The methodology is applied to a representative configuration consisting of an all-movable hypersonic vehicle lifting surface model containing aerothermoelastic effects attached to a single-degree-of-freedom oscillator representing the fuselage. Results from validation cases are first presented. The partitioned solution methodology is then used to investigate the impact of lifting surface–fuselage inertial coupling on overall vehicle dynamics.",53,11

A carbon fiber preform material sample has been investigated in a high-enthalpy airflow corresponding to a Hayabusa reentry condition at a 78 km altitude. The applied photogrammetry uses two digital single lens reflex cameras triggered at to acquire images simultaneously from two different perspectives of the sample exposed to the high-speed flow. The photogrammetric analysis resolves the surface with , approximately 400 dpi, allowing the in situ analysis of the recession phenomena of ablators. Material inhomogeneities are identified during the ablation process, and surface recession is derived with an accuracy of .

3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053785,"Freejet experiments have been conducted in a shock tunnel with a small airframe-integrated three-dimensional scramjet engine. The goal of the investigation was to examine the influence of airframe integration on the engine operation. The tests were conducted at a condition replicating flight at Mach 10.4 and a dynamic pressure of 48 kPa. The internal flowpath featured a rectangular-to-elliptical shape transition inlet designed for flight at Mach 12, an elliptical combustor with a constant area and diverging section, and a three-dimensional thrust nozzle. This flowpath was integrated with a forebody and streamlined external geometry similar to what would be expected on a flight vehicle. Gaseous hydrogen fuel was injected either through portholes on the inlet or a combination of inlet injection with a series of portholes behind a rearward-facing step at the combustor entrance. Experiments at a range of fuel equivalence ratios indicated that both fuel-injection schemes produced robust combustion without the use of ignition aids. Comparison with semifreejet tests of a three-times scale engine with a truncated forebody showed a slight reduction in the overall combustion generated pressure rise in the current experiments. These results indicate that airframe integration does not lead to significant degradation in the performance of this engine.",53,11
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053744,"This paper presents an application of the pressure-sensitive paint technique to investigate two-dimensional unsteady flow in a transonic channel. This work is a contribution to the study of the transonic interaction between an oscillating shock wave and a separated boundary layer in a channel flow. The shock-wave oscillation is forced by the periodic variation of the section of a second throat by means of a rotating elliptical shaft located in its section. The channel’s lower wall is equipped with a contour profile, or bump, allowing for flow separation. To achieve a reduced response time for surface pressure measurements, we use anodized-aluminum coating as pressure-sensitive paint instead of usual paint. An aluminum insert including the bump was manufactured and coated with anodized-aluminum pressure-sensitive paint. Images were acquired by using a high-speed camera, and pressure-sensitive paint results were compared with pressure tap and Kulite sensor measurements implemented in the insert. Spectral analysis was carried out to assess the ability of anodized-aluminum pressure-sensitive paint for understanding unsteady aspects of such a complex channel flow.",53,11

The measurement includes bending and torsion stiffnesses, section geometric offsets, and mass and inertia properties. Several Second Higher-Harmonic Aeroacoustic Rotor Test blades, including the original instrumented blade used for the wind-tunnel test campaign in 2001, as stated by Yu et al. (The HART-II Test: Rotor Wakes and Aeroacoustics with Higher-Harmonic Pitch Control (HHC) Inputs—The Joint German/French/Dutch/US Project, Proceedings of the 58th American Helicopter Society (AHS) Annual Forum, American Helicopter Soc., Montreal, June 2002) are used for the activity. A finite element-based cross-section analysis combined with an x-ray computer tomography technique is employed for the cases where no mechanical measurement is available or attempted. The resulting structural properties are correlated against the earlier estimated values, which have extensively been used in the literature for the validation of the Second Higher-Harmonic Aeroacoustic Rotor Test rotor. A substantial deviation is observed between the present measurement and the earlier property result. The comprehensive rotor dynamics analysis is performed to quantify the impact of the measured blade properties on the aeromechanics behavior of the rotor. The location of the center of gravity is demonstrated to be the most influential factor affecting the deviation and the sensitivity of the aeroelastic response of the rotor.",53,11

Although the linear equations are formulated in the frequency domain for best combined efficiency, accuracy, and robustness in industrial environment, the nonlinear feedback loops are modeled in the time domain to provide maximal flexibility in adding nonlinear effects in all the involved disciplines. The linear equations are solved first to provide a baseline response to deterministic or stochastic gusts, maneuver commands, or direct-force excitations using fast Fourier transform techniques. Nonlinear effects are then added in a time-marching process that modifies the linear solution using convolution integrals. The numerical process was used in the Dynresp code that was recently developed as a framework for industrial applications and research in the area of nonlinear structural dynamics. The procedure is outlined with emphasis on structural nonlinearities using a fictitious-mass technique. The numerical example exhibits limit-cycle oscillations due to actuator nonlinearities.",53,11
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053834,"An experimental investigation was conducted into the nature of the vortex shedding generated by truncated and nonflat serrated trailing edges of a NACA 0012 wing section as well as the aerodynamic performance of such trailing edges. In line with previous findings, the truncated trailing edge generates a significant amount of vortex shedding, while increasing both the maximum lift and drag coefficients, resulting in an overall reduction in the maximum lift-to-drag ratio compared to a plain NACA 0012 wing section. By decreasing the chevron angle of the nonflat trailing-edge serrations (i.e., by making them sharper), the energy of the vortex shedding significantly decreases, and the lift-to-drag ratios increase compared to a plain NACA 0012 wing section. Fractal/multiscale patterns made of scaled-down repetitions of these serrations were also investigated with a view to further improve performance. It was found that the energy of the vortex shedding increases with an increasing fractal iteration if the chevron is broad but decreases for sharper chevrons . It is believed that if is too big, the multiscale trailing edges are too far away from each other to interact and break down the vortex shedding mechanism. Fractal/multiscale trailing edges are also able to improve aerodynamic performance compared to the NACA 0012 wing section.",53,11
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053846,"Large-eddy simulation is used to investigate steady-state mass flow injection into a supersonic jet stream with and without flapping motion of the microjets. The results are validated with particle image velocimetry and acoustic measurements. The effect of microjet penetration on the far-field acoustics is studied by altering the number of injectors, the cross-sectional area of each injector, and the injection mass flow. The injectors are evenly distributed around the nozzle exit. The injection angle is 90 deg relative to the main jet flow. This research is a continuation of a previous large-eddy simulation study of pulsed injection that showed that the unsteady injection-induced pressure pulses in the jet caused increased tonal noise for far-field observers at low angles. Flapping jet injection was shown to minimize the creation of the pressure pulses, except for high-amplitude flapping angles and high injection mass flows, where the injections divert out of the shear layer and introduce periodic superposition of the double shock-cell structure. Furthermore, the flapping injection did not show improved noise reduction compared with the steady injection, which is essentially promising because steady injection proves to be a more practical solution for implementation in real jet engine applications.",53,11
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053838,"Several reduced-order modeling strategies have been developed to create low-order models of geometrically nonlinear structures from detailed finite element models, allowing one to compute the dynamic response of the structure at a dramatically reduced cost. However, the parameters of these reduced-order models are estimated by applying a series of static loads to the finite element model, and the quality of the reduced-order model can be highly sensitive to the amplitudes of the static load cases used and to the type/number of modes used in the basis. This paper proposes to combine reduced-order modeling and numerical continuation to estimate the nonlinear normal modes of geometrically nonlinear finite element models. Not only does this make it possible to compute the nonlinear normal modes far more quickly than existing approaches, but the nonlinear normal modes are also shown to be an excellent metric by which the quality of the reduced-order model can be assessed. Hence, the second contribution of this work is to demonstrate how nonlinear normal modes can be used as a metric by which nonlinear reduced-order models can be compared. Various reduced-order models with hardening nonlinearities are compared for two different structures to demonstrate these concepts: a clamped–clamped beam model, and a more complicated finite element model of an exhaust panel cover.",53,11
10,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053837,"Ongoing research toward the reduction of environmental noise from aircraft is investigating the possible shielding of engine-noise sources by novel airframe configurations. To assess the noise-reduction benefits attainable from such configurations, it is necessary to develop appropriate acoustic evaluation tools. In this paper, a jet-noise-shielding-prediction methodology is described. The Tam–Auriault ( “ Jet Mixing Noise from Fine-Scale Turbulence ,” AIAA Journal , Vol.  37 , No.  2 , 1999 , pp.  145 – 153 ) jet-noise model with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes solution input, together with a Fresnel–Kirchhoff diffraction method ( Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics , Wiley-Interscience , New York , 2000 , pp.  472 – 494 ), is used to make isolated and shielded far-field jet-noise predictions. This methodology is employed as a sensitivity-analysis tool to establish the relative importance of the source location, spatial extent, and directivity in jet-noise-shielding predictions. Predictions have been made for a shielded single-stream Mach 0.9 jet, and compared with experimental data. Good qualitative agreement is observed, and the disagreement in the shielding levels is most likely due to underestimation of the source axial extent by the jet-noise model.",53,11

This effect may lead to instability or large vibration response. Aiming at this problem, a virtual mass model based on three-dimensional potential flow theory is used to characterize the interaction between propellant and tank wall, reflecting the flow characteristics of propellant more accurately. Also axial symmetry is used to decrease the degree of freedom of the structure system. For each component of propulsion system, the time-domain relationship between pressure and flux is deduced. At last, governing equations of a propulsion-structure coupled system in the form of second-order system of ordinary differential equations are established. On this basis, characteristic properties and sensitivity of the coupled system can be calculated easily, making easy the optimal design of the system.",53,11
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053946,"An experimental study of the spatial distribution of integral eddy speeds in heated, supersonic free jets is presented. The physics of such jets are of immediate interest to noise-reduction approaches for tactical aircraft jet noise. In these flows, the noise produced has a strong influence from eddy speeds, particularly for radiation in peak noise directions, due to Mach wave contributions. The measurements obtained using a time-resolved Doppler global velocimetry instrument experimentally indicate a key mechanism of the role of heating in jet noise reduction relative to the classical Lighthill scaling. Measurements are presented in jets issuing from an axisymmetric biconic nozzle at two conditions: total temperatures of 1.6 and 2.0 times that of the ambient and both at approximately diameter Reynolds number and pressure-matched exit conditions. For the higher total temperature case, the scaled streamwise eddy convective velocities within the shear layer were measurably reduced compared to the lower total temperature case, especially as the axial distance from the nozzle exit increased. These findings confirm that core plume heating results in additional shear layer spreading and reduction of scaled eddy convective speeds, making acoustic radiation less efficient with heating. To accompany the eddy convection results, data obtained in the same facility using laser Doppler velocimetry are analyzed for second- and fourth-order moments, indicating the importance of the fourth-order correlation in the region of immediate interface between the potential core and the shear layer.",53,11
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053950,"Power extraction from wind and water streams using flapping wings is known to be an alternative method to harvest renewable energy. The vortical flow structures around and in the wake of a NACA0012 airfoil oscillating with non-sinusoidal pitching and plunging motions are investigated using digital particle image velocimetry and compared with Navier–Stokes computations to give insight into the physics that determine the performance of an oscillating-wing power generator for a plunge amplitude of 1.05 chords, reduced frequency of 0.8, pitch amplitude of 73 deg, pivot points at quarter and mid-chords, phase angles of 90 and 110 deg, and stroke reversal times of 0.1 (rapid reversal) to 0.5 (sinusoidal reversal) at a Reynolds number of . As the airfoil rotation speed during pitch reversals is increased, vortex shedding occurs earlier with higher strength. As the phase angle by which the pitching motion leads the plunging motion is increased, the shed vortex convection distance is also increased. There is good agreement between the flow structures obtained using 2_D Navier–Stokes simulations and those from particle image velocimetry measurements in terms of the formation, evolution and the timing of shedding of the leading edge and trailing edge vortices. Time-averaged vorticity results reveal that power producing oscillating-airfoils generate a time-averaged wake flow whereas an inner-jet like flow is present for all the cases with negative time averaged power output. Both particle image velocimetry measurements and Navier–Stokes simulations show that the time averaged power output is primarily determined by the timing of the formation of the leading edge vortex, its convection, and its interaction with the airfoil.",53,11

For simulations that may have large relative motion between multiple bodies, overset grid methods have demonstrated distinct advantages over mesh movement strategies. Combining these approaches offers the ability to accurately resolve the flow phenomena and interaction that may occur during unsteady moving boundary simulations. Additionally, overset grid techniques when used within a finite element setting mitigate many of the difficulties encountered in finite volume implementations. This paper presents the development of an overset grid methodology for use within a streamline/upwind Petrov–Galerkin formulation for unsteady, viscous, moving boundary simulations. Furthermore, a novel hole cutting procedure based on solutions to Poisson equations is introduced and compared with existing techniques. Order of accuracy is examined via the method of manufactured solutions and the extent of the overlapped region is studied. Overset grid results are presented for several steady-state and time-dependent moving boundary simulations with linear, quadratic, and cubic elements.",53,11
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053970,"The interaction of wakes generated by a fan with the outlet guide vanes occurring at the blade-passing frequency and its harmonics is mainly responsible for aeroengine tonal noise emission in approach conditions. Conventional rotor–stator interaction models assume axisymmetric rows and quasi-annular ducts. However, the stator of new engines is characterized by nonidentical vanes (so-called heterogeneous outlet guide vane) and integrates two internal bifurcations up to the nacelle outlet. These new technologies invalidate the existing tools adopted by engine manufacturers at the design stage. For this reason, hybrid methodologies based on a three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation considering the complete geometry of a modern Snecma engine model are investigated in this paper. Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation output data are postprocessed using different integral methods to assess the impact of the heterogeneity on angular mode distribution (compared to an idealized homogeneous stator) and the effect of bifurcations on downstream propagation. In particular, the Goldstein formulation is extended to loading sources distributed over nonidentical vanes. The harmonic sound power predictions derived from loading noise equations are also compared to a direct calculation of the acoustic intensity obtained by extracting the perturbation fields over prescribed cross sections behind the outlet guide vanes. This method requires a suited spatial filtering process in order to reduce the contribution of vortical waves known for polluting the acoustic field. A modal decomposition of the extracted perturbations on a Fourier–Bessel basis is also proposed to avoid this difficulty. Finally, computational fluid dynamics solutions and acoustic predictions compare reasonably with the available experimental data issued from a half-scale turbofan test.",53,11
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053711,"Computational solutions of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations have been used to understand the performance of thrust-augmenting ejectors for vertical and short takeoff and landing aircraft. These solutions show how ejector performance depends on the principle ejector design parameters, including the ejector inlet area, the diffuser exit area, and the length of the ejector duct, as well as the type and configuration of the primary jet nozzles. It is concluded that there is a relatively sharp peak in ejector performance that occurs over a relatively narrow range of inlet area ratios where the character of the flow changes from duct flow to free jet flow. Both the peak performance and the optimum inlet area ratio are seen to increase with the length of the ejector duct. Both increasing the jet entrainment rate and the addition of wall jets are shown to enhance the performance of short aircraft ejectors.",53,11
18,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053983,"This paper represents the continuation of the works previously published in Chong et al. (“Self-Noise Produced by an Airfoil with Nonflat Plate Trailing-Edge Serrations,” AIAA Journal, Vol. 51, No. 11, 2013, pp. 2665–2677), who used several nonflat plate serrated trailing edges for the reduction of airfoil self-noise. The poro-serrated concept developed in the current work improves substantially the overall noise performance of the nonflat plate trailing-edge serration type. The use of porous metal, synthetic foams, or thin brush bundles to fill the gaps between adjacent members of the sawtooth can completely suppress the bluntness-induced vortex shedding tonal noise. Most important, up to 7 dB turbulent boundary layer–trailing-edge broadband noise reduction can simultaneously be achieved without compromising the aerodynamic performances in lift and drag. The poro-serrated trailing edges do not cause any noise increase throughout the frequency range investigated here. The reduction of the turbulent broadband noise is primarily caused by the serration effect, but under a condition that the sawtooth surface must be solid and nonporous. The primary role of the porous metal foams in a poro-serrated trailing edge is to suppress the vortex shedding tonal noise. However, an optimum selection of the porous material is also found to be able to further reduce the broadband noise level. The new serrated trailing-edge concept developed here has the potential to improve the industrial worthiness of the serration technology in achieving low noise radiation in fan and turbine blades.",53,11
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053992,"The propellant microstructure is addressed for the interpretation and the prediction of agglomerate size distribution in aluminized composite solid rocket propellants. Although the mixing process of a propellant is intrinsically random, repetitive fuel-rich local structures (pockets) are generated in the bulk. Pockets are privileged locations for agglomerate generation. In the present work, second-order spatial statistics are applied to model propellants for the characterization of the microstructure and for the definition of an agglomeration model. The model propellants used in this work are generated by a packing code on the basis of real formulations, which are experimentally characterized for validation purposes. The average size and the metal content of the pockets are derived from the interpretation of the radial distribution function. The model is capable of predicting the size distribution of the incipient agglomerates for given propellant microstructures, using one free parameter for the tuning. The fitting of experimental agglomeration data from four different industrial propellants suggests that the free parameter can be expressed as a power function of the combustion pressure and that the microstructure agglomeration model produces particle distributions that reasonably match with the experimental data.",53,11
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053997,"An experimental investigation into the mechanism of streamwise vorticity generation in an array of plasma streamwise vortex generators is presented. The array is flush mounted to a flat plate on which a nominally zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer develops upstream. The investigation is focused on characterization of the influence of freestream velocity, applied peak-to-peak voltage, length of the active electrode, and spanwise interelectrode spacing on streamwise vorticity generation. It is shown that the actuator creates wall-normal vorticity and reorients it into the streamwise direction. In addition, spanwise boundary-layer vorticity is reoriented into the streamwise direction. Scaling relations based on the vorticity transport equation are obtained and experimentally validated. These provide guidance for optimizing the actuators for particular flow control applications.",53,11

A decomposition into components linked to shock waves, viscous interactions, and lift-induced vortices is straightforward for steady flows. A formulation based on thermodynamic considerations is used at ONERA–The French Aerospace Lab and by its partners but is restricted to steady cases. Another team made a first attempt in generalizing it to time-dependent flows, but their decomposition still holds terms that cannot be matched with physical phenomena. This paper presents another generalization to unsteady flows of the steady formulation. The proposed method relies on a strong theoretical background and allows the breakdown of drag into the three usual components only. This new unsteady formulation is applied to an OAT15A profile under a buffet condition, then to a NACA0012 profile at a high angle of attack with natural vortex shedding, and finally to a pitching profile. The results are analyzed and compared to the only other formulation available to break down the drag of unsteady configurations.",53,11

Currently employed predictive capabilities to model the complex turbulent plume physics are too dissipative to accurately resolve the propagation of acoustic waves throughout the launch environment. Higher fidelity liftoff acoustic analysis tools to design mitigation measures are critically needed to optimize launch pads for the Space Launch System and commercial launch vehicles. To this end, a new coupled two-field simulation capability has been developed to enable accurate prediction of liftoff acoustic physics. Established unstructured computational fluid dynamics algorithms are used for simulation of acoustic generation physics and a high-order-accurate discontinuous Galerkin nonlinear Euler solver is employed to accurately propagate acoustic waves across large distances. An innovative hybrid computational fluid dynamics/computational aeroacoustics coupling method is used to transmit the computational fluid dynamics-predicted acoustic field to the computational aeroacoustics domain for accurate propagation throughout the launch environment. Implementation of the coupling procedure is described in detail, and results are presented that demonstrate the accuracy of the capability for aeroacoustics predictions.

23,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J053952,"The paper presents a multifidelity robust optimization technique with application to the design of rotor blade airfoils in hover. A genetic algorithm is coupled with a non-intrusive uncertainty propagation technique based on polynomial chaos expansion to determine the robust optimal airfoils that maximize the mean value of the lift-to-drag ratio while minimizing the variance, under uncertain operating conditions. Uncertainties on the blade pitch angle and induced velocity are considered. To deal with the variable operating conditions induced by the considered uncertainties and to alleviate the computational cost of the optimization procedure, a multifidelity strategy is developed that exploits two aerodynamic models of different fidelity. The two models correspond to different physical descriptions of the flowfield around the airfoil; thus, the multifidelity method employs the low-fidelity model in regions of the stochastic space where the physics of the problem is well captured by the model, and it switches to high-fidelity estimates only where needed. The proposed robust optimization technique is compared with the robust optimization based on the high-fidelity aerodynamic model and the deterministic optimization, to assess the capability of finding a consistent Pareto set and to evaluate the numerical efficiency. The results obtained show how the robust multifidelity approach is effective in reducing the sensitivity of the designed airfoils with respect to variation in the operating conditions.",53,11
24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054007,"Whereas the sound radiated from the inlet of turbofans is mainly due to rotor–stator interactions in approach flight, the shock waves (or N-waves) emitted by the rotor at transonic rotation speeds can be a dominant noise source during takeoff and climb. The study of N-waves needs to take account of two main processes: 1) the generation of N-waves for a perfect rotor (in which all blades are identical) and for a real rotor (considering small geometrical blade dispersion), and 2) The N-wave propagation through the inlet duct producing the blade passing harmonics for a perfect rotor, and the multiple pure tones (harmonics of the rotation frequency) for a real rotor. Several approaches have been investigated for the past 40 years. This paper intends to cross-check the main methods by applying them to two modern turbofan demonstrators. Moreover, a prospective way of N-wave generation based on geometrical considerations is investigated thanks to test data related to near-field pressure signatures and blade stagger angle measurements during the engine operation. This prediction overcomes some drawbacks of other methods. Moreover, it appears to be very efficient to build rotor blade arrangements that reduce the sound pressure level of the multiple pure tones.",53,11
