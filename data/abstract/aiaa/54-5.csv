In the present study, a two-dimensional direct numerical simulation is used to establish a benchmark for supercritical flow at a high Reynolds number and high-density ratio at conditions typically encountered in liquid rocket engines. Emphasis has been placed on maintaining the flow characteristics of actual systems with simple boundary conditions, grid spacing, and geometry. Results from two different state-of-the-art codes, with markedly different numerical formalisms, are compared using this benchmark. The strong similarity between the two numerical predictions lends confidence to the physical accuracy of the results. The established database can be used for solver benchmarking and model development at conditions relevant to many propulsion and power systems.",54,5
1,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054176,"Large-eddy simulations are performed for a Mach 0.5 flow over a cylindrical turret with turbulent separation over a flat optical window. Optical wave-front distortions induced by the separated shear layer are calculated based on the computed fluctuating-density field, the Gladstone–Dale relation, and ray tracing. The statistical properties of the flowfield and optical distortions are compared with experimental measurements, and reasonable agreement is obtained. It is found that pressure fluctuations in the separated shear layer are the dominate mechanism of optical distortions. The magnitude and correlation length scales of wave-front distortions increase with streamwise aperture size, and the frequency spectra of distortions exhibit a slope in the inertial subrange of the turbulent flow. Very little difference in the flow and optical statistics is observed at two different Reynolds numbers, indicating Reynolds number insensitivity. The similarities and differences of the aero-optical characteristics of the separated shear layer and the upstream boundary layer are also discussed.",54,5

Theoretical results were compared to numerical simulation (performed by solving three-dimensional inviscid Euler equations with an non-oscillatory and non-free-parameters dissipative finite difference scheme) and analyzed thoroughly. The effects of inflow Mach number, sweep angle, and wedge angle on flowfield parameters and wave configurations were also considered. The influence of sweep angle is negligible, but the effects of Mach number and wedge angle are significant.",54,5

The subgrid terms in large-eddy simulations are modeled using a combination of the dynamic Smagorinsky (“ General Circulation Experiments with the Primitive Equations. Part I, Basic Experiments ,” Monthly Weather Review , Vol.  54 , No.  1 , 1963 , pp.  99 – 164 ) and Yoshizawa (“ Statistical Theory for Compressible Turbulent Shear Flows, with the Application to Subgrid Modelling ,” Physics of Fluids , Vol.  54 , No.  1 , 1986 , pp.  2152 – 2164 ) models. Simulations are performed for supersonic jets having Reynolds numbers of 1500, 3700, and 7900, and Mach numbers of 1.4 and 2.1. Two of the simulations are validated with experimental data. The Reynolds number value is observed to play a role in the transition to turbulence but, once transition is achieved, it has a subdued effect above a threshold value; that is, as seen experimentally for supersonic flows, a similarity is found here. This similarity occurs for Reynolds number values that are relatively small compared to those typical of the fully turbulent regime. The turbulent structures in the transition region are more coherent, and the potential core is longer when the Mach number is larger, which leads to a slower downstream velocity decay. The root-mean-square velocities are biased in the axial direction, as expected. In the fully turbulent regions, the computed Reynolds stress is higher for a larger-Mach-number jet. Peak pressure fluctuations occur at about half a jet diameter, radially away from the centerline of the jet, and this location is independent of both the Reynolds number and Mach number values. The pressure–velocity correlations and the turbulent kinetic energy profiles are investigated along the centerline and radial directions, and it is found that the peak turbulent kinetic energy occurs at the same location as the maximum pressure fluctuations.",54,5
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054440,"A hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian approach was used to develop a model for predicting the penetration of a liquid jet in a subsonic gaseous crossflow. This was achieved by taking into account the effect of all forces acting on the jet, including drag, gravitation, and surface tension, as well as the mass shedding from the liquid column. The effect of mass shedding from the liquid column and jet Reynolds number on the spray penetration height was also studied. It was found that, although the momentum flux ratio plays a predominant role in the prediction of a liquid jet column, the liquid jet penetration can be affected when changing the ambient temperature and pressure (or gas to liquid density and viscosity ratio), especially when holding constant and jet velocity . Two correlations were developed in the form of sinusoidal-exponential and logarithmic function for the prediction of liquid column and droplets’ plume regions, respectively. The proposed correlations are capable of predicting jet penetration of different liquids in a subsonic crossflow at different operating conditions and injection angles. The predictions showed reasonable agreement with published experimental data and empirical correlations.",54,5

The proposed methodology was applied to the estimation of the parameter in the modified Menter shear-stress transport turbulence model. For this purpose, a fundamental turbulent flow, namely, the flow over a two-dimensional backward-facing step, was employed. The estimated value of (1.0) differed from its original value (i.e., 0.31). The modified Menter shear-stress transport turbulence model with was validated on several turbulent flow calculations; flows over a two-dimensional backward-facing step and a two-dimensional flat-plate boundary layer, two-dimensional transonic flows around the RAE 2822 airfoil, and three-dimensional transonic flows around the ONERA M6 wing. In simulations, the modified Menter shear-stress transport turbulence model with better modeled the separated and adverse pressure gradient flows than the original modified Menter shear-stress transport turbulence model with . Furthermore, in the absence of separation and adverse pressure gradient flows, the proposed and original modified Menter shear-stress transport turbulence models computed almost the same results. These observations suggest that the proposed data assimilation methodology effectively estimates the optimal parameter values of turbulence models and that the estimated (1.0) improves the performance of the modified Menter shear-stress transport turbulence model over the original value (i.e., 0.31).",54,5

The model’s predictive capabilities are also assessed based on four basic and three extended validation cases, involving attached and separated boundary-layer flows, effects of streamline curvature, and secondary flow.

7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054505,"This paper reports on the SIMPLE-like solution algorithm that significantly improves velocity–pressure coupling, leading to the accelerated convergence. The algorithm is applicable to both incompressible and compressible flows. It is implemented within the framework of a cell centered finite volume method using colocated storage of flow variables on unstructured grids. The convergence acceleration is an outcome of the novel treatment of the pressure correction equation that accounts for two commonly neglected terms appearing in a general pressure correction equation. These terms, namely, the neighbor and nonorthogonal corrections, represent velocity corrections from neighboring cells and the cell-face pressure correction gradient associated with the grid nonorthogonality, respectively. Reminiscent of the PISO method, both neighbor and nonorthogonal corrections are taken into account by performing two or more correction steps. However, the full inclusion of neighbor velocity corrections can prevent the solution convergence. Following an analogy between time marching and a steady-state iterative approach, this problem has been resolved by introducing a pseudounsteady term into discretized velocity correction equations. Using this term, the contribution of neighbor corrections is underrelaxed, enabling a satisfactory convergence rate. The algorithm is applied to several benchmark test cases, covering laminar and turbulent, as well as incompressible and compressible, flows. For all test cases, the convergence rate can be significantly improved by performing two or more pressure correction steps. An optimal number of pressure corrections exists for which a meaningful reduction of computing time is possible.",54,5

Time-scaled single-point (auto)correlation functions show that, to the side of the nozzle exit, the temporal-correlation envelope decays rapidly, whereas the envelope decays more slowly in the maximum radiation region and farther downstream. This type of spatial variation has been previously attributed to a transition from fine- to large-scale mixing noise in laboratory-scale jets. Two-point space–time (cross) correlation functions demonstrate that noise from a single engine operating at intermediate power is similar to that from a heated, convectively subsonic laboratory-scale jet, whereas additional features are seen at afterburner, relative to supersonic laboratory jets. A complementary coherence analysis provides estimates of coherence lengths as a function of frequency and location. Acoustic coherence lengths across the ground microphone array are used to analyze one-dimensional, equivalent-source-coherence lengths obtained from the DAMAS-C beamforming algorithm. The source coherence reaches its maximum downstream of the maximum source level, suggesting that uncorrelated sources meaningfully contribute to the dominant source region. In addition to revealing further the nature of the sound field near an advanced tactical engine, the characteristics seen should be useful as a phenomenological comparison point for those trying to model military-scale results both experimentally and numerically.",54,5
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054741,"In engineering applications, resolution is often low. In these underresolved regions, the truncation error of the underlying numerical schemes strongly affects the solution. If the truncation error functions as a physically consistent subgrid-scale model (that is, it models the evolution of otherwise resolved scales), resolution may remain low. Thereby, computational efficiency is improved. The sixth-order adaptive central-upwind weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme with implicit scale separation, denoted as WENO-CU6-M1, potentially allows for physically consistent implicit subgrid-scale modeling, when shaped accordingly. In this work, finding an optimal formulation of WENO-CU6-M1 is considered within a deterministic design optimization framework. Possible surrogate modeling and sampling strategies are considered. Design optimization is based on evaluating the potential of a WENO-CU6-M1 scheme formulation to reproduce Kolmogorov scaling for a Taylor–Green vortex in its quasi-isotropic state. As in the absence of physical viscosity, kinetic energy dissipates exclusively due to the subgrid-scales, the Reynolds number is infinite, and the evolution of the flow is determined by proper subgrid-scale modeling. To complete the work, the effective numerical dissipation rate of the WENO-CU6-M1 model optimized for artificially compressible fluid flows is quantified, and it is compared to the original one. Not only is the zero viscosity limit considered, but the model behavior is benchmarked offdesign, for low to high Reynolds numbers. A comparison to an alternative explicit and implicit subgrid-scale model demonstrates its superior behavior for the chosen test flow.",54,5

The cost function for each tetrahedron is based on the element condition number. This condition number incorporates a weight matrix that transforms the element from physical space to a reference space. The condition number is a measure of the conformity of the physical element with respect to the reference element. Feature-based adaptation is incorporated into the element weight matrix to influence the node perturbation scheme to favor nonunit aspect ratio elements.

It was shown that, with an appropriate finite volume scheme, a matched layer (or absorbing layer) can be automatically captured as a discontinuity across the absorbing boundary, rendering an extremely simple yet robust absorbing boundary condition. This new absorbing boundary condition is attributed to the shock-capturing capability of the finite volume scheme, with no direct relation to any existing nonreflecting boundary condition. As a sequel, the present paper focuses on application of the new absorbing boundary condition. Several more non-trivial benchmark examples are demonstrated to further show its robustness and versatility for various types of continuous and discontinuous waves in domain of different shapes. Then it is examined in practical problems with experimental data, rendering a viable tool for compressible flow and aeroacoustics computation.",54,5

One-dimensional Euler equations are solved inside the duct using a finite volume formulation in which the advective fluxes are calculated using the advection upwind splitting method. The model was developed as a fast design tool for helicopter rotor blades with internal spanwise flow. To this end, centrifugal as well as Coriolis effects, frictional losses, duct sweep, and time-dependent duct boundary conditions are modeled, and a spanwise flow control valve can be included. The model is used to explore the behavior of a 2-m-long duct with a circular cross section, rotating at tip speeds of up to . The effects of centrifugal pumping, duct friction, duct sweep, and a flow control valve on the spanwise pressure and velocity distribution, mass flow rate of air through the duct, and torque required to spin the duct are discussed.",54,5
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054321,"A large-amplitude low-frequency oscillation has been reported in the literature for some airfoils in a small range of angles of attack before stall. In the current study, the same low-frequency oscillations are shown to be triggered by two methods of active flow control at poststall angles. Active control is applied in the form of external acoustic excitation or a row of discrete jets that are operated in a pulsed or steady mode. Conditionally averaged particle image velocimetry and time-resolved surface pressure measurements are used to evaluate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the oscillation. By systematically increasing forcing amplitude, each flow control technique is shown to first excite low-frequency oscillation up to a maximum lift increase, after which subsequent increases in forcing amplitude attenuate and ultimately eliminate low-frequency oscillation altogether. At maximum oscillation amplitude, the behavior is highly periodic in the case of acoustic forcing and intermittent in the case of pulsed or steady jets. The dynamics associated with the oscillation are shown to include the shedding of a large vortex structure, with noted similarity to the dynamic stall vortex seen on pitching or plunging airfoils.",54,5

Force measurements reveal that lift is close to unsteady theory while advancing into the freestream, if the angle of attack permits attached flow. Lift is augmented at large angles of attack, where the flow is separated under steady conditions, and does not become appreciatively negative in flow reversal for either attached or separated flow, contrary to one unsteady theory but supported by another. Dye flow visualization reveals a coherent vortical structure upstream of the leading edge before flow reversal, which is believed to attenuate negative lift.",54,5

Acoustic measurements have been taken in the Stability Wind Tunnel at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with a microphone array at a range of Reynolds numbers (, based on chord), angles of attack , and for a variety of airfoil aspect ratios (airfoil length-to-chord ratio of ). Spectral data show the dominant noise sources are airfoil trailing-edge noise and tip-vortex-formation noise. Acoustic data are also used to evaluate semi-empirical prediction of wall-mounted finite airfoil trailing edge and tip noise with the so-called Brooks, Pope, and Marcolini model.

The combustion chamber is accelerated as a rigid body using a prescribed acceleration time history; it is found that accelerations of proper magnitude, duration, and frequency induce a pressure wave inside the combustion chamber that grows to a screeching acoustic wave limit cycle. For a rectangular rocket motor, a reciprocating transverse acceleration leads to the development of a transverse pressure wave limit cycle; for a cylindrical rocket motor, the limit cycle may be either a standing wave, for a transverse reciprocating acceleration, or a spinning wave, for a transverse rotating acceleration. It is found that a limit cycle may be induced by either a large acceleration pulse of short duration or a smaller acceleration pulse of a longer duration. The polynomial chaos expansion method is used to study the probability of growth to a limit-cycle oscillation when the amplitude and frequency of the transverse acceleration pulse are random.",54,5

Both nozzles exhibit free-shock separated flow, restricted-shock separated flow, and an end-effects regime before flowing full. Transient (startup) operations of the nozzles are studied, with the primary focus being the pulsations that form during the end-effects regime. This occurs at a pressure ratio of 37 for these nozzles and is associated with elevated sound levels in the immediate vicinity of the nozzles and vehicle. The shadowgraphy images reveal the formation of turbulent large-scale structures, on the order of the nozzle diameter, during the end-effects regime.

We focus specifically on high-speed flow conditions and consider a wide range of Mach numbers near the high subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes. Various flow parameters such as the coefficients of lift and drag as well as the coefficients of pressure, skin friction, and wall heat transfer have been investigated as a function of both the Mach number and the Knudsen number to gain insight into the flow physics in the different regimes. The flow characteristics in the transonic regime have been found to be substantially different from those in the supersonic regime. In particular, an inverse Magnus effect involving a change in the direction of the lift force occurs in the supersonic regime. In contrast, subsonic flows in the early slip-flow regime experience the conventional direction for the Magnus lift force. This paper demonstrates that there is a subtle interplay between the Mach number and Knudsen number for the occurrence of the inverse Magnus effect.",54,5
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054118,"A parametric numerical study was performed to study effects of the nonuniform premixing of a hydrogen–air mixture on the structures of oblique detonation and shock-induced combustion formed on the surface of a hypersonic spherical projectile. Axisymmetric two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations were solved with a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism involving nine species. A smooth-front oblique detonation formed on the hypersonic projectile at a Mach number of 6.46 under a uniformly stoichiometric condition was taken as the completely premixed case. For nonuniform cases, hydrogen mole fraction was distributed at the inlet boundary based on the Gaussian function. As the nonuniformity was increased, the following occurred: 1) deformed oblique detonation, 2) oscillating shock-induced combustions with nonuniform corrugated structures, 3) steady shock-induced combustions with (and without) the minimum induction length located outside the centerline, and 4) nose-confined combustion.

In this study, the contribution of near-wall chemical reactions to heat flux is investigated and quantified by suitable numerical analyses. Numerical results are first compared to literature experimental data of wall heat flux in subscale calorimetric thrust chambers for both oxygen/methane and oxygen/hydrogen propellant combination. Then, a parametric analysis is carried out varying chamber pressure, wall temperature, and propellant combination. This study highlights that oxygen/methane combustion products are more subject to near-wall recombination phenomena. They provide an increase of wall heat flux between 20 and 30% with respect to the frozen flow model evaluation, whereas in the case of oxygen/hydrogen, the wall heat flux increase due to recombination reactions is between 7 and 14%.",54,5

The Ritz method is used to compute a preliminary estimate of the natural frequencies for the desired modes. These estimates are then used as initial guesses by SUPORE, which employs superposition and reorthonormalization to accurately solve the governing boundary value problem. Compared to a high-fidelity Ritz approximation or a highly refined finite element modeling procedure, this is a simple, computationally less expensive, and yet highly accurate method to compute mode shapes for applications that require higher modes.

A theoretical model is first developed to describe the coupled system, which consists of an multiple-flywheel system and a multi-axis isolator. The rotating wheels in multiple-flywheel system, which introduce gyroscopic effects, are modeled as rigid rotors supported by resilient isolation struts mounted on a fixed spacecraft. Next, the optimization problem of multiple-flywheel system isolation is formulated by a constrained nonlinear multi-objective function. The objective function is used to minimize the transmitted disturbances to the spacecraft and simultaneously obtain the most favorable modal characteristics for the integrated system of multiple-flywheel system and an isolator under the constraints of spacecraft application. The mass properties of multiple-flywheel system, stiffness coefficients and mounting configuration of isolation struts, which play important roles in the dynamic characteristics and isolation performance of isolators, are chosen as the design variables. A hybrid algorithm combining both genetic algorithms and sequential quadratic programming methods has been adopted to calculate optimum solutions.

The role of multidisciplinary design optimization considering system uncertainty is increasingly being recognized in improving satellite performance, safety, and reliability. However, high-dimensional uncertainty hampers the efficiency and accuracy of reliability-based robust design optimization. In this study, a novel multidisciplinary optimization methodology suitable for high-dimensional uncertainty is established and verified. The in-loop uncertainty quantification employing active subspace identification makes the uncertainty propagation and management much easier. Based on the discovered active subspace and a system decoupling strategy, a multiobjective alliance algorithm is presented for the complex constrained design optimization. Typical uncertain factors in small satellites are characterized and interdisciplinary relations are analyzed. A standard test example of speed reducer design first proves the methodology, and then an Earth observation satellite fully illustrates the efficacy. Through 23-dimensional uncertainty represented by one dimension, the multiobjective alliance algorithm gives well-distributed Pareto-optimal (PO) solutions, providing a fruitful reference for decision makers compromising different design targets, like satellite mass, total cost, and ground resolution.

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054529,"Parameter uncertainty is a fact of life for engineering design. Historically, uncertainty has been treated by a factor of safet, worse-case analysis, or Monte Carlo methods. More recently, the field of robust optimization has arisen to treat parameter uncertainty more precisely. These new methods balance objective function values with desired uncertainty distributions or intervals for the chosen parameters. A standard feature of current methods is that they require information about the uncertain variables to be known before the method can be applied. This paper seeks to take an alternate viewpoint to the treatment of uncertainty. Rather than begin with a known parameter distribution, it was decided to let the problem itself resolve information regarding the inherent model flexibility that may already exist. This provides additional model insight and can inform engineering decisions regarding the final design early in the design process. A modified approach to robust design is presented first, where a revised form of the original model can be used to determine existing parameter flexibility. Then, this approach is applied to a simple geometric example and a traditional optimization problem, which is called the Golinski speed reducer.",54,5

Examples include panels in airframes that are exposed to high temperatures and sensors used for vibration tuning. This paper addresses the techniques to optimize the microstructure design for polycrystalline metals. The microstructure is quantified with the orientation distribution function that determines the volume densities of crystals that make up the polycrystal microstructure. The orientation distribution function of polycrystalline alloys (e.g., hexagonal close-packed titanium) is represented in a discrete form, and the volume-averaged properties are computed through the orientation distribution function. The optimization is performed using the space of all possible volume-averaged macroproperties (stiffness and thermal expansion). A direct linear solver is employed to find the optimal orientation distribution functions. The direct solver is capable of finding exact solutions even for problems with multiple or infinite solutions. It is first applied to the optimization of the panel-buckling problem. The objective of the buckling optimization problem is to find the best microstructure design that maximizes the critical buckling temperature. The optimum solution computed with this approach is found to be same as the optimum solution of a global approach that uses a genetic algorithm. The linear solver methodology is extended to plastic properties and applied to explore the design of a Galfenol beam microstructure for vibration tuning with a yielding objective. The design approach is shown to lead to multiple optimum solutions.",54,5

The design is parametrized using a fiber angle and fictitious density distribution for each ply. The solution proceeds using a successive conservative convex approximations strategy. Starting from a feasible point, the algorithm converges to a local minimum. The structural responses are approximated separately in terms of the angle and fictitious density distributions of each ply. Explicit penalization of intermediate densities is used to force the densities to either one for ply coverage or zero for no coverage. Ply drop locations are identified as the boundary between regions having densities near one and those near zero. The ply drop optimization is combined with fiber angle optimization by alternating the optimization between the corresponding sets of variables. Optimized variable-stiffness variable-thickness composite laminates, with a prespecified ply drop order, are obtained.

28,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J054648,"Analytical and experimental results are presented regarding the nonlinear temperature-curvature relationship displayed by composite bimorph shells. Snap-through action, driven solely by temperature change, is demonstrated using fiber–metal hybrid laminates. These laminates exploit the high coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between composites and metals to yield thermal bimorphs with tailorable properties. To predict the potentially nonlinear response of these laminates, an energy-based multistability model is developed and made available online. The model utilizes experimentally measured one-dimensional thermally induced curvatures as input parameters to predict a corresponding shell’s two-dimensional flexural behavior. Initial curvature is found to be a critical component in enabling snap-through behavior, especially when partnered with highly orthotropic internal moments. Interestingly, the class of unsymmetric laminates popular in the study of thermally induced bistability are shown to be inherently incapable of displaying thermally driven snap-through behavior, regardless of initial curvature. Modeling results compare well with experiments for a square-planform hybrid laminate. The potential impact of this work is the realization of passively controlled, variable geometry structures that can be triggered to change shape at certain temperatures or within specified temperature ranges. Applications include flow and cooling control of gas turbine engines, spacecraft passive thermal control systems, and bimorph-based micro-electromechanical systems.",54,5
