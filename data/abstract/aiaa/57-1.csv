2,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057487,"Building on the well-known Prandtl lifting line, this work proposes an extended framework for mollified lifting lines, which is valid for multidimensional Gaussian smoothings. The smoothing length scale can be taken as constant or variable across the span. In this framework, a slender lifting device and its wake are represented by a mollified vortex tube and a mollified vortex sheet. Although the resulting formulation is similar to the original one, it is shown that a sectional mean downwash must be used in the integrodifferential equation from which the circulation distribution is obtained. Interestingly, it is also shown that this equation is unaffected by the presence of mollification in the streamwise direction. As an application, the case of the elliptical wing is revisited with several smoothing configurations. The results are consistent with the original singular lifting line, and the peculiarities of the circulation and downwash distributions are investigated. A uniform downwash is also recovered for a specific configuration. Finally, the constant and the variable regularizations are found to yield similar results. Overall, the proposed method provides accurate results that can be compared with those from numerical methods, such as the actuator line model, immersed lifting lines, or other similar methods.",57,1
3,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057544,"In this numerical–theoretical study, a linear BiGlobal stability analysis of the steady massively separated flow around a NACA 4415 airfoil was performed at a low Reynolds number and a high angle of attack close to a wavy ground, with a focus on the effect of three different types of stationary roughness: 1) a perfectly flat ground, 2) a wavy ground with small-amplitude undulations, and 3) a wavy ground with large-amplitude undulations. On increasing the undulation amplitude of the ground but keeping the mean ground clearance constant, it was found that the lift coefficient increased owing to an increase in the static pressure under the airfoil, which is reminiscent of the conventional ground effect over a flat surface. However, it was also found that the leading flow perturbation was the three-dimensional stationary global mode and not the two-dimensional traveling Kelvin–Helmholtz mode, contrary to the results of previous analogous studies of linear global instability of massively separated flow away from the ground. This study provides new insight into the stability of airfoil–ground flow systems at a low Reynolds number and a high angle of attack, contributing to a better understanding of the ground-effect aerodynamics of small insects and micro air vehicles flying over rough waters or complex terrain.",57,1
4,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056876,"This survey paper consists of a review of flow-control applications using numerical simulations, where the goal is to provide guidance to the developers of flow-control approaches. The computational methods are described with the focus on practical simulations of flow control for flight vehicles. One approach uses the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes formulation, and the other method is based on the lattice Boltzmann method. Special boundary conditions used to model a set of flow-control techniques and to guide the development of new actuation methods are highlighted. Results of studies aimed at solving a broad set of aerodynamic and propulsion flow problems through computational simulations are presented. The flow-control techniques are used for the control of flow separation as well as manipulating vortical flow structures for achieving a desired objective. The results include flow-control implementations for aircraft and rotorcraft targeting commercial and military applications. In cases where experimental data are available, selected flow-control scenarios are used to illustrate the validity of the computational methods in predicting realistic flows.",57,1
5,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056521,"This paper reviews recent work on several flow control actuators, as well as a new hybrid actuator, and their interaction with a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate. The focus is on 1) a finite-span synthetic jet, where the effects of the jet orifice aspect ratio and its skew and pitch angles relative to the flow are presented; 2) a finite-span low-aspect-ratio static or dynamic pin (with similar height to the local boundary layer), where the effect of the pin’s aspect ratio is discussed; and 3) a hybrid actuator, which incorporates the previous two actuators. First, the formation and evolution of flow structures associated with a synthetic jet issued into a laminar boundary layer, where the effect of the orifice’s aspect ratio, as well as its pitch and skew angles, are explored. Next, the effects of the pin’s aspect ratio and its dynamic motion are shown. Finally, the interaction of the hybrid actuator with the flow has shown that the combined effects of the synthetic jet and the pin resulted in alteration of the vortical structures with minimal penalty. This suggests that the hybrid actuator might be efficient for controlling different types of flowfields. An example of controlling separation over a flapped airfoil was also included, where an array of passive cylindrical pins yielded delayed or complete mitigation of separation. This was mostly due to the introduction of streamwise vortices, which redirected the flow toward the surface and energized the boundary layer. Moreover, the effect of a single dynamic pin on flow separation was larger than that of a single static pin.",57,1
6,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056258,"This paper describes unconventional techniques to manipulate the pressures, forces, and moments acting on an airfoil without movable control surfaces. The method relies on active flow control (AFC), a versatile tool for modifying flowfields to create innovative flow effectors. By the generation of unsteady vortices emanating from suction and oscillatory blowing (SaOB) actuators, attached or incipiently separated flows are forced to be separate or become more attached. In this way, pressures, forces, and moments acting on an airfoil can be altered in a desired and controlled manner. Wind-tunnel tests performed on the Israel Aerospace Industries AR2 low-Reynolds-number airfoil included baseline and AFC configurations. The airfoil was instrumented with two independent SaOB actuator arrays. If eventually the concept can be transferrable to finite wings it would create an alternative maneuvering system, with no moving parts. It was found that the current AFC system is capable of increasing the lift (as a virtual flap system) or increasing the drag (as a virtual spoiler) while only weakly altering the other parameter, over a wide range of incidence angles from zero lift to stall. The system has an effect that is deemed minor on the airfoil pitching moment, again to be evaluated on a specific three-dimensional configuration. The effects of the mass and momentum transfer on the estimated forces and moments are discussed as well.",57,1
7,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057012,"This paper presents an investigation of the flow physics and control of cavity flow oscillations using a three-dimensional (3-D) array of steady jets located near the cavity leading edge. The array injects 3-D, steady flow normal to the freestream to suppress the fluctuating surface pressure in a rectangular cavity with a length-to-depth ratio of 6 for Mach 0.3 to 0.7. Sixteen configurations are assessed for their suppression as a function of the aggregate momentum coefficient , spatial duty cycle , and dimensionless wavelength . Significant reductions of fluctuating surface pressure are observed. Schlieren and particle image velocimetry are performed to investigate the baseline and controlled flows. Companion large-eddy simulations with spanwise periodic boundary conditions at Mach 0.6 generally agree with the experiments, despite a significant difference in the Reynolds numbers. The simulations show that control reduces the pressure fluctuations inside the entire cavity, albeit at a higher level of . Spanwise wavelike structures produced by the control input distort the shear layer, inhibit the growth of large-scale vortical structures, and reduce the strength and length scale of turbulent fluctuations near the impingement region. A slot-configuration design guide is provided, which compares favorably with the limited available data in the literature.",57,1
8,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057413,"The present work investigates sidewall effects on the characteristics of three-dimensional (3-D) compressible flows over a rectangular cavity with aspect ratios of and at using large-eddy simulations. For the spanwise-periodic cavity flow, large pressure fluctuations are present in the shear layer and on the cavity aft wall due to spanwise vortex roll-ups and flow impingement. For the finite-span cavity with sidewalls, pressure fluctuations are reduced due to interference to the vortex roll-ups from the sidewalls. Flow oscillations are also reduced by increasing the Mach number from 0.6 to 1.4. Furthermore, secondary flow inside the cavity enhances kinetic energy transport in the spanwise direction. Moreover, 3-D slotted jets are placed along the cavity leading edge with the objective of reducing flow oscillations. Steady blowing into the boundary layer is considered with momentum coefficient and 0.0194 for and 1.4 cases, respectively. The three-dimensionality introduced to the flow by the jets inhibits large coherent roll-ups of the spanwise vortices in the shear layer, yielding 9–40% reductions in root mean square (rms) pressure and rms velocity for both spanwise-periodic and finite-span cavities.",57,1
9,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057274,"Passive flow control devices for a fully turbulent backward-facing step flow were investigated experimentally with particle image velocimetry and dynamic pressure transducers in the Trisonic Wind Tunnel Munich at Mach numbers of 0.80 and 2.00, as well as at Reynolds numbers of and 210,000, respectively. The results showed that these flow control devices, which are comprised of circular and square convoluted trailing edges on the backward-facing step, were a far more effective alternative to active flow control. The mean reattachment length was reduced by over 80% for the most effective configuration: so-called square lobes with a protrusion height of 0.4 step heights. This geometry also reduced the root mean square of the pressure fluctuations experienced by the reattachment surface by nearly 50% in transonic conditions. It was shown that the harmful step mode was weakened by forcing streamwise vorticity onto the flow through the presence of the lobes. The square lobes were more effective in diffusing this mode when compared to the circular lobes. Similarly, with increasing lobe sizes, the effectiveness of the flow control devices increased. Thus, a simple passive solution was determined for reducing the buffeting effects experienced by space launchers in transonic flight, for instance.",57,1

The investigated model represents a swept 2.5D section of the pylon-wing junction in landing configuration. A flow control system employing periodic excitation is integrated into the unprotected leading edge inboard of the pylon. Tuft visualization as well as pressure and force measurements are used to investigate the vortex-dominated base flow and the effect of active flow control. It is shown that the flow control effect is governed by the normalized parameters of flow control, the momentum coefficient, and the velocity ratio, and is largely independent of the free-stream Mach and Reynolds number within the investigated range. The influence of a variation of the momentum coefficient on the lift gain is investigated. At the highest Reynolds number of an application of active flow control with fully eliminates local separation and increases total lift by approximately 2% of the respective baseline value across a range of 5 deg in angle of attack.",57,1
11,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057215,"In this Paper, the effect of herringbone riblets as a means of suppressing shockwave-induced flow separation is investigated. A spanwise array of ribleted strips is applied behind the leading edge of a double ramp model placed in a Mach 5 freestream. The high-speed schlieren technique is used to examine the shockwave pattern and the state of the boundary layer developing along the surface of the model. Both pressure-sensitive paints and temperature-sensitive paints are employed to assess the impact of riblets on the interaction between the shockwave and the boundary layer. The results from this experiment show that herringbone riblets are capable of suppressing shock-induced flow separation and hence improving pressure recovery. Furthermore, it is also revealed that these microscale riblets induce large-scale streamwise vortical structures within the boundary layer similar to those observed in incompressible flows. It is believed that these vortices promote momentum transfer within the boundary layer, hence providing the dominant mechanism for suppressing flow separation.",57,1
12,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057056,"Turbine blades operating in transonic–supersonic regime develop a complex shock wave system at the trailing edge: a phenomenon that leads to unfavorable pressure perturbations downstream and can interact with other turbine stages. Understanding the fluid behavior of the area adjacent to the trailing edge is essential in order to determine the parameters that have influence on these pressure fluctuations. Colder flow, bled from the high-pressure compressor, is often purged at the trailing edge to cool the thin blade edges, affecting the flow behavior and modulating the intensity and angle of the shock waves system. However, this purge flow can sometimes generate nonsymmetrical configurations due to a pressure difference that is provoked by the injected flow. In this work, a combination of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations and a global stability analysis is employed to explain the physical reasons of this flow bifurcation. By analyzing the features that naturally appear in the flow and become dominant for some value of the parameters involved in the problem, an antisymmetrical global mode, which is related to the sudden geometrical expansion of the trailing-edge slot, is identified as the main mechanism that forces the changes in the flow topology.",57,1
13,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057257,"A series of wind-tunnel experiments was conducted on a dynamically pitching NACA 0012 airfoil in order to understand the unsteady flow physics associated with dynamic stall at a transitional Reynolds number of . The airfoil was pitched about the quarter-chord axis following a linear ramp maneuver at . A series of high-frequency unsteady surface pressure measurements were acquired in order to investigate the time-dependent behavior of the flow in the immediate vicinity of the airfoil. These surface pressure measurements actively displayed the evolution of the airfoil boundary layer, leading-edge laminar separation bubble, and dynamic stall vortex. A detailed time-frequency analysis of surface pressure measurements was performed in order to identify the dominant frequencies associated with the unsteady laminar separation bubble. This analysis was also used to study the evolution of the length scales associated with flow structures near the airfoil leading edge, which emerged before the formation of the dynamic stall vortex. Finally, time-resolved particle image velocimetry measurements were acquired to study the evolution of the off-body flowfield during the development of dynamic stall.",57,1
14,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057077,"The chordwise, unsteady pressure difference field for harmonically oscillating airfoils operating in the attached flow, light dynamic stall, and deep dynamic stall regimes has been modally decomposed to identify well-defined modal structures that persist across a vast parameter space of pitching parameters (i.e., reduced frequency, mean angle of attack, and oscillation amplitude). The pressure difference fields were acquired at a chord Reynolds number and Mach number of and , respectively, demonstrating results applicable to rotorcraft flight conditions. Notably, only four mode shapes were required to reconstruct the aerodynamic loads anywhere within the parameter space. Likewise, the same mode shapes showed a remarkable ability to reconstruct the aerodynamic loads of other (non-native) airfoil geometries with a similar precision. The parametric modal decomposition outlined provides a foundation to elucidate the physics of the dynamic stall phenomenon as well as reduced-order modeling techniques for the aerodynamic loading.",57,1
15,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057132,"Computational and experimental results for pitching and plunging airfoils were used to study the time lag associated with boundary-layer convection and to develop a model that can be used to augment inviscid theoretical methods for unsteady airfoil flows to include the effects of trailing-edge separation and unsteady stall. Computations using an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes code were used to obtain results for airfoils in steady flow and for several pitch and plunge motions. The motions were selected such that stall occurred only due to trailing-edge separation without leading-edge vortex formation. Viscous corrections to inviscid airfoil theory are first calculated in steady flow by implementing a nonlinear decambering flap to model the effect of the separated boundary layer. A leading-edge suction parameter, from earlier research, is used to connect the aerodynamic state in unsteady motion with a steady-state condition. Computational results showed that the differences in aerodynamic loads between steady and unsteady flows can be attributed to the boundary-layer convection lag, which can be modeled by choosing an appropriate value of a time-lag parameter . To provide appropriate viscous corrections to inviscid unsteady calculations, the nonlinear decambering flap is applied with a time lag determined by the value, which was found to be essentially independent of motion kinematics for a given airfoil and Reynolds number. The predictions of the aerodynamic loads, unsteady stall, hysteresis loops, and flow reattachment from the low-order model agree well with computational fluid dynamics and experimental results, both for individual cases and for trends between motions. The model was also found to perform as well as existing semi-empirical models while using only a single empirically defined parameter.",57,1
16,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057634,"To simulate the effects of gusts and maneuvers, lift, moment, and flow measurements are presented for a periodically plunging airfoil at a Reynolds number of 20,000 over a wide range of reduced frequency , amplitude , and mean angle of attack (0–20 deg). For this parameter range, the maximum lift in the cycle is determined by the circulatory lift, regardless of whether a leading-edge vortex (LEV) is formed or not, whereas the maximum nose-down moment is determined by the competition between the added mass and the arrival of the LEV near the trailing edge. The LEV generally increases the mean lift and decreases the mean moment. This increase, which is not predicted well by the reduced-order models, correlates with the maximum effective angle of attack of the motion, rather than the Strouhal number. In contrast, the amplitude and phase of lift are predicted well by the Theodorsen theory (Theodorsen, T., “General Theory of Aerodynamic Instability and the Mechanics of Flutter,” NACA TR 496, 1949), whether LEVs are present or not. Hence, LEVs have a minimal effect on the fluctuating lift. However, the amplitude of the pitching moment is not predicted well by the Theodorsen theory, if LEVs are present. The competition between the added mass and the LEV causes the nonmonotonic variation of the moment amplitude as a function of reduced frequency.",57,1
17,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057383,"Lagrangian saddles, identified as nonparallel intersections of finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) ridges, have previously been shown to indicate the timing of von Kármán vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder using two-dimensional simulation data. To expand the application of this method, two-dimensional, two-component velocity data were collected in the wake of a circular cylinder using particle image velocimetry at a Reynolds number of 19,000. This experimental data, as well as three-dimensional simulation data at a Reynolds number of 400, were used to calculate FTLE fields. The Lagrangian saddle found upstream of a forming vortex was shown to accelerate away from the cylinder surface as the vortex begins to shed for both cases, in agreement with the previous work. These saddles are impossible to track in real time, however, because future flowfield data are needed for the computation of the FTLE fields. To detect the Lagrangian saddle acceleration without using FTLE, the saddle dynamics are connected to physical quantities measurable in real time. The acceleration of the Lagrangian saddle occurs simultaneously with a maximum in lift in the numerical case and with a minimum in the static pressure at a location slightly upstream of the mean separation location in both cases, albeit with a lag time in the experimental case. This allows the time at which the von Kármán vortex sheds, determined objectively by the acceleration of the Lagrangian saddle away from the circular cylinder, to be identified by distinct signatures in the spatiotemporal evolution of the pressure distribution on the cylinder surface.",57,1

In this work, a three-dimensional planar overexpanded nozzle, characterized by an internal flow separation, has been simulated by means of the delayed detached-eddy simulation (DDES) method. The unsteady pressure signals have been analyzed by the wavelet decomposition to characterize their spectral content. The results indicate that the DDES approach is able to capture the shock oscillations, and the computed characteristic frequency is close to the ones available from literature for the same test case. The fundamental frequency computed in this work is lower than the one predicted by the model of the longitudinal acoustic frequency. The self-sustained oscillation is driven by a pressure imbalance between the pressure level downstream of the recompression shock and the ambient. Different nozzle pressure ratios (NPRs) have been simulated, all showing the same qualitative behavior, even if the test case with the highest NPR seems to be heavily influenced by the presence of a large region with reversed flow.",57,1
19,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057036,"Laminar-turbulent boundary-layer transition is investigated on the suction side of Mach-scaled helicopter rotor blades in climb and analyzed in view of the effect of rotational forces. Transition positions are detected with temperature-sensitive paint and complemented by surface pressure measurements at two radial blade sections. The effect of rotational forces is investigated by systematic variation of the Rossby number from to at and . The findings do not show a significant effect on boundary-layer transition in the investigated parameter range and suggest predominantly two-dimensional flow behavior. The result is supported by subsequent validation with two-dimensional numerical tools. Based on quantitative agreement between measured and calculated surface pressures, measured transition positions are predicted to within chord if a critical amplification factor of is used in the coupled Euler/boundary equation solver MSES for transition prediction in the rotor test facility of the DLR, German Aerospace Center in Göttingen, Germany. The measured transition onset positions are also correlated with integral growth rates, obtained from separate two-dimensional compressible boundary-layer computations and subsequent local linear stability analysis to get transition factors of . Differences in factors are discussed in view of the different approaches used. Overall, transition -factor correlations are independent of relative chord Reynolds number and incompressible shape factor at the detected transition onset. The findings underline the capability of two-dimensional numerical techniques based on linear stability theory to model boundary-layer transition in the investigated parameter range.",57,1
20,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057437,"Experimental measurements were performed on a swept flat-plate model with an airfoil leading edge and imposed chordwise pressure gradient to determine the effects of a backward-facing step on transition in a low-speed stationary crossflow-dominated boundary layer. Detailed hot-wire measurements were performed for three step heights ranging from 36 to 49% of the boundary-layer thickness at the step and corresponding to subcritical, nearly critical, and critical cases. In general, the step had a small localized effect on the growth of the stationary crossflow vortex, whereas the unsteady disturbance amplitudes increased with increasing step height. Intermittent spikes in instantaneous velocity began to appear for the two larger step heights. A physical explanation was provided for the mechanism leading to transition and the sudden movement in the transition front due to the critical steps. The large localized velocity spikes, which ultimately led to an intermittent breakdown of the boundary layer, were the result of nonlinear interactions of the different types of unsteady instabilities with each other and with the stationary crossflow vortices. Thus, the unsteady disturbances played the most important role in transition, but the stationary crossflow vortices also had a significant role via the modulation and the increased amplitude of the unsteady disturbances.",57,1
21,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057079,"The results obtained from a priori channel-flow tests show that the dissipation terms of some tested low-Reynolds-number models possess correct near-wall behaviors, whereas those obtained from a posteriori full computations by the same tested models do not. Such a contradiction is clarified comparing the behaviors extracted from exact analysis and particular models. Solutions of approximate near-wall equations show that the models produce overprediction in the viscous sublayer due to lower orders of leading turbulent-stress terms than in conventional expansions depending on a wall-normal coordinate. The modifications of dissipation-tensor and pressure-containing term approximations using a new geometry-independent “near-wall” tensor are proposed. This corrects the near-wall behaviors for the lowest-order Reynolds-stress expansion terms and improves prediction accuracy, particularly in the secondary recirculation zone of a turbulent flow behind a backward-facing step.",57,1
22,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057411,"The performance of countless engineering systems usually depends on various physical phenomena belonging to different disciplines, such as solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Such problems are normally referred to as multiphysics. Topology optimization provides a promising approach to systematically solve multiphysics problems, which are often dominated by nonlinear phenomena and are not well suited to intuitive design strategies. Topology optimization methods have been extensively developed and applied to problems that are dominated by single phenomena, such as compliance minimization in structural mechanics and pressure drop minimization in fluid mechanics. However, significantly less research has been applied to topology optimization of multiphysics problems. In this paper, the design of transpiration-cooled porous structures will be performed using topology optimization. The design domain is the porous material that the coolant penetrates in transpiration-cooling systems. This is a coupled problem for which the interaction of multiple physical phenomena (namely, fluid mechanics and heat transfer) needs to be accounted for. This is achieved through coupled numerical simulations of porous media and pure fluid flow using a two-domain approach. To the best of our knowledge, topology optimization has not yet been applied to the design of transpiration-cooling systems.",57,1

24,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056818,"The objective of this numerical study is to analyze the excitation mechanisms of high-frequency thermoacoustic instabilities. Two distinct acoustic wave/flame interaction scenarios are considered, which can arise in a technical combustion system. First, an acoustic oscillation is enforced with the pressure antinode at the burner centerline, termed as pressure forcing. Second, a transverse acoustic oscillation is enforced with the velocity antinode at the burner centerline, termed as velocity forcing. The excitations are created by the interaction of two incident acoustic waves for a range of excitation frequencies of practical relevance. The susceptibility of the flame to acoustic oscillations is quantified using the Rayleigh index. Detailed postprocessing is performed to investigate the underlying thermoacoustic mechanisms and to quantify the contributions of each possible mechanism to the total Rayleigh index of the system as a function of different excitation frequencies. It is observed that the main driving mechanism with pressure forcing can be related to the density oscillation and that the main driving mechanism with velocity forcing can be related to the flame surface oscillation relative to the position of the acoustic pressure node. For both forcing cases, the laminar flame speed is varied to change the length of the flame. With pressure forcing, the highest Rayleigh index is found for a specific flame length, associated to a specific laminar flame speed. With velocity forcing, the Rayleigh index increases when the flame speed is reduced and the flame length is increased, respectively.",57,1
25,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056341,"High-order computational fluid dynamics is gathering a broadening interest as a future industrial tool, with one such approach being flux reconstruction (FR). However, due to the need to mesh complex geometries if FR is to displace current lower–order methods, FR will likely have to be applied to stretched and warped meshes. Therefore, it is proposed that the analytical and numerical behaviors of FR on deformed meshes for both the one-dimensional linear advection and the two-dimensional Euler equations are investigated. The analytical foundation of this work is based on a modified von Neumann analysis for linearly deformed grids, which is presented. The temporal stability limits for linear advection on such grids are also explored analytically and numerically, with Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) limits set out for several Runge–Kutta schemes, with the primary trend being that contracting mesh regions give rise to higher CFL limits, whereas expansion leads to lower CFL limits. Lastly, the benchmarks of FR are compared to finite difference and finite volumes schemes, as are common in industry, with the comparison showing the increased wave propagating ability on warped and stretched meshes, and hence FR’s increased resilience to mesh deformation.",57,1
26,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057014,"The convergence to the steady state of an implicit unstructured density-based compressible Navier-Stokes flow solver shows many cases exhibiting stalling or slower convergence in the later part mainly due to fluctuation in the local error. This causes a delay in convergence and often prevents machine zero convergence from being achieved. This paper presents the use of local error control for acceleration of later convergence. This method is tested against standard benchmark problems, and then on a more complex case of flow over an airfoil taken from recent published work. The results show that the method is capable of very rapid acceleration to machine zero convergence. The acceleration has been found to be of an order of 500–1000% faster in comparison to the same implicit scheme with Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy-based time stepping and no local error control. The present method acts on top of the implicit solver, and thus its implementation requires very little modification to an existing code.",57,1

A comprehensive statistical analysis, with a sufficiently large number of samples, remains elusive. Statistical learning is an approach that allows for extracting more information using fewer samples. Such procedures, if successful, will greatly enhance the predictability of models in the sense of improving exploration and characterization of uncertainty due to model error and input dependencies, all while being constrained by the size of the associated statistical samples. In this paper, it is shown how a recently developed procedure for probabilistic learning on manifolds can serve to improve the predictability in a probabilistic framework of a scramjet simulation.

It consists of a shock oscillation that induces pressure and notably lift fluctuations, thus limiting the flight envelope of civil aircraft. The aim of the present Paper is to improve the understanding of the flow physics of the three-dimensional transonic buffet over swept wings through the analysis and comparison of four different experimental databases. In particular, the objective is to identify characteristic values of the phenomenon such as Strouhal numbers, convection velocities, buffet onset, etc. It is shown that some dimensionless numbers are kept constant among the different databases and consequently can be considered as characteristics, whereas others change. The key factors in the understanding of the three-dimensional transonic buffet phenomenon lie in explaining common features but also the variability of transonic buffet characteristics in different configurations. In particular, it is shown that three-dimensional buffet is characterized by a Strouhal number in the range 0.2–0.3 and a spanwise convection velocity of , where denotes the freestream velocity. These characteristic ranges of frequencies are larger than those of the two-dimensional buffet phenomenon, which suggests different physical mechanisms.",57,1

A structural model based on the Rayleigh–Ritz method, combined with the aerodynamic piston theory, is derived to represent the aeroelastic behavior of rectangular plates under different boundary conditions. In this model, the classical lamination theory, considering a symmetric stacking sequence and fiber trajectories described by Lagrange polynomials of different orders, is used. In addition, manufacturing constraints, which impose limitations to the feasible fiber trajectories, and the effect of in-plane loads are considered in the model. Using a multicriteria differential evolution algorithm, numerical optimization is performed for a variety of scenarios and aimed at increasing the flutter and linear buckling stability margins of tow-steered plates, considering the geometrical parameters defining the fiber trajectories on the layers as design variables. The results obtained for the different optimization scenarios are compared, having a composite plate with unidirectional fibers as the baseline and aimed at evaluating the benefits achieved by the optimum tow-steered plates.

This comprehensive analysis tool couples the variational asymptotic beam sections, geometrically exact fully intrinsic beam equations, and the circuit equation for smart materials. It takes into account the electromechanical coupling behavior of smart materials both in the cross-sectional analysis and in the one-dimensional generalized beam theory.",57,1

The accurate response and life predictions of such structures require methods that enable direct time integration over long portions of flight trajectories, and also require the ability to resolve local stress concentrations. The approach proposed here takes root in displacement-based reduced order modeling to allow for direct time integration. The reduced order models (ROMs) are built using first a ROM constructed over the uncracked structure, whose global basis is augmented with localized enrichment basis functions that are constructed to capture the localized impact of a crack on the displacement field of the structure. The enrichment bases are built using a 3D generalized finite element model defined only in the region of the crack itself. Detailed stress information can also be extracted from the 3D fracture model. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a cracked flat cantilevered blade model, and the benefits of coupling the global basis functions and the localized enrichment bases are demonstrated.",57,1
32,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J056519,"The present paper aims to study the random static behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates using nonpolynomial zigzag theories. The nonpolynomial zigzag theories are proposed earlier by the authors, which satisfy the transverse shear-stress continuity conditions at the layer interfaces including the traction-free boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces of the plate. These theories incorporate the realistic nonlinear distribution of transverse shear stresses across the thickness of the plate. A probabilistic procedure is developed using a stochastic finite element method that is in the conjunction of finite element method with a mean-centered first-order perturbation technique, to obtain the second-order statistics of deflections of the laminate. The problem is analyzed considering the material properties of laminated composite and sandwich structures to be random in nature while the other system properties are assumed to be deterministic. The stochastic results in terms of mean as well as standard deviation of the responses have been obtained for various combinations of geometric parameters, stacking sequences, span–thickness ratios, and boundary conditions and compared with those existing in the literature and Monte Carlo simulation approach.",57,1
33,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057377,"Microstructure design can have a substantial effect on the performance of critical components in numerous aerospace applications. However, the stochastic nature of metallic microstructures leads to deviations in material properties from the design point and alters the performance of these critical components. In this paper, a novel stochastic linear programming (LP) methodology is developed for microstructure design accounting for uncertainties in desired properties. The metallic microstructure is represented using a finite element discretized form of the orientation distribution function (ODF). The inverse LP problem solves the mean values and covariance matrix of the ODFs to maximize the mean values of a property, given the statistical constraints on other properties. The highlight is an analytical uncertainty quantification model via a Gaussian distribution to model propagation of microstructural uncertainties to the properties. Examples illustrate maximization of the yield strength and magnetostriction of a galfenol alloy when constrained by uncertainties in a set of stiffness constants.",57,1
34,https://doi.org/10.2514/1.J057608,"The laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process has been used to fabricate unique specimens with inherent damping capability for suppressing vibratory responses associated with high cycle fatigue. The innovative concept of the unique specimen is that it is manufactured with internal geometries, densely packed with unfused powder, and during vibration, the powder interaction dissipates energy via friction. Studies of this manufacturing and design approach have demonstrated the capability of suppressing vibration by 10X of a fully fused part. A particle motion mechanism has been identified, and association with vibratory behavior produces a criterion for damping optimization. Despite the accuracy of the criterion, the sustainability (or degradation) of initial/inherent damping performance after subjection to millions of cycles at high strain amplitudes has not been extensively scrutinized. This Paper investigates damping performance sustainment by assessing the endurance, repeatability, and recovery of the inherent damping provided by unfused powder within a uniquely designed specimen. Endurance and repeatability assessments, respectively, identify a limitation in achieving optimal damping and a steady-state damping performance after millions of duty cycles at high strain amplitudes. Though the optimal damping performance recovery attempt is negligible, the inherent damping of the unique specimen after rigorous usage is greater than the results from fully fused parts.",57,1
