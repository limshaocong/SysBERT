KeePass Password Safe is an OSI Certified Open Source Software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 2 or under. The system gives resolution to memorizing passwords problem. Its purpose is to keep all of the user’s passwords, data, email accounts, usernames and URLs stored in a very secure, encrypted database, protected by a Master Password. The system is very small so it can be easily transferred from one computer to another. It provides several functionalities on the already encrypted data and the new ones to be inserted. The database produced, is protected by a Master Password only known by its inventor with no backup if lost.',\n",
              " '· When writing this document it was inherited that all requirements have the same priority. · First there is presented an overall view about KeePass and then all features and functions are analyzed in detail.',\n",
              " 'This requirement document contains general information about KeePass, main classes and use cases, functions, features and special technologies. It describes in detail all that KeePass needs to work properly and with safety. The rest of the document is divided into chapters for better understanding. In chapter 2 an overall description of KeePass is provided. First product perspective is presented with product features and main functions. Then follow user classes and characteristics, operating environments that KeePass supports as well as design and implementation constraints. After all that user documentation is presented and will provide you with more details about each feature’s technology. In chapter 3 most important features are presented with detailed description, use cases and requirements. In chapter 4 user and communication interfaces are described. In chapter 5 requirements about safety and performance are presented. This document is intended for Developers: in order to be sure they are developing the right project that fulfills requirements provided in this document. Testers: in order to have an exact list of the features and functions that have to respond according to requirements and provided diagrams. Users: in order to get familiar with the idea of the project and suggest other features that would make it even more functional. Documentation writers: to know what features and in what way they have to explain. What security technologies are required, how the system will response in each user’s action etc. Advanced end users, end users/desktop and system administrators: in order to know exactly what they have to expect from the system, right inputs and outputs and response in error situations.',\n",
              " 'KeePass Password Safe is a small system that can be easily transferred from computer to computer by a simple USB stick. Its purpose is to solve a problem that really bothers many people today when they have to choose from memorizing a lot of passwords to be secure or to use every time the same one so they won’t forget it but risk be found out by others. So it provides you a very secure, encrypted database where you can keep inside all your passwords, usernames, email accounts, URLs, notes without any risk for others to find them. That is because KeePass Password Safe can lock every database with only one Master Password and/or key file. There are no duplicates, anywhere in your computer, of this Master Password and/or key file so in case of lost database cannot be opened by anyone. Not even by you and that is because there is no recovery password or back door. KeePass Password Safe beside security also provides you with several functionalities in order to keep your database organized and up to date. Those are analyzed in the following pages. More about KeePass you can find out at http://keepass.info/',\n",
              " 'More about KeePass can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/keepass/ In this website you can find out more about the project and discuss any questions in the forums. You can go back and look at previous releases, code and problems that have been solved. There you can also find information about the developers as well as the project’s main characteristics such as programming language and algorithms http://keepass.info/ This is project’s official website where you can find links to all above and also find features available for downloading such as language translations and plug-ins.',\n",
              " 'KeePass consists of a database which contains data for one or more users. Each user’s data are divided into groups and subgroups so that they are organized in a form that serves right the user. Every user has a unique Master Key which can be simple or composite and its combination opens uniquely the database. If lost there is no recovery. Groups and subgroups contain entries with usernames, passwords URLs etc that can be sent or copied to websites, application and accounts. There is also the ability for a onetime key creation to be used once in a transaction without the risk of reused by others for any reason. In the diagram below there are the main components of the system, subsystem interconnections and external interfaces to help you understand the main idea of KeePass. All of them are analyzed with more details in this document.',\n",
              " 'KeePass Password Safe provides the user with the following functions: Database – New, Open, Close, Save, Print, Search, Import, Export User can create a new database locked by a Master Key. The database can be opened and closed whenever user wants it. Changes on the data are permitted and the changes can be saved. The user also can print all data in order to keep them with him even when a computer is not available. Also the user can search the database using key words through a search engine provided with the software. Last but not least, the database can be imported and/or exported from/to the Internet. Group/Subgroup – Add, Modify, Delete, Find Data are organized in groups and subgroups in the order that user wants and finds effective. Those groups can be modified whenever. New groups and subgroups can be added easily and can be deleted the same way. The feature of searching can be applied in just one group and not in the whole database if wanted. Entry – Add, View/Edit, Duplicate, Delete A new entry can be added in any group or subgroup and it contains title, username, password, URL and notes. Not all fields are required for an entry. An entry can be duplicated and deleted in the click of a button. Change Language At KeePass website there are available language translations that can be downloaded and applied easily. Auto-Type The user can select a sequence of keypresses that KeePass will be able to perform and send them to any window or browser. Command Line Options The user can pass a file path in the command line in order for KeePass to open this file at startup. Composite Master Key To open a database you must use all key sources such as password, key file and/or Windows account details that were used when the Master Key was created. All these together form the Composite Master Key and are all required in order to open the database. So the user cannot use a combination of them to unlock the database. Configuration This feature is used to explain how KeePass store its configuration and where. · Import/Export KeePass can support importing data from CSV files, Code Wallet, Password Safe and Personal Vault. Integration KeePass uses Global Hot Key to restore KeePass main window and Limit to single instance option to run only one instance of KeePass at a time. Password Generator There are available generations based on character sets and based on patterns the first for generating random passwords and the second for creating passwords which require specific patterns. There is also available generating passwords that follow rules which are determined further down on this document. Then there are security-reducing options which reduce the security of the passwords they are applied to. Finally there are configuring settings of automatically generated passwords for new entries so that a random password will automatically be created by KeePass when a new entry is wanted. Secure Edit Controls KeePass offers the ability for passwords and data to be appeared behind asterisks when the user wants it. When this option is turned on, secure edit controls stronger than the ones of Windows are protecting your data and no one can access them, see them or steal them. TAN Support KeePass uses TAN-Transaction Authentication Numbers for even more security. This feature can be used for generating one time passwords so that there won’t be any chance, for anyone to access e.g. your bank account even if he finds out that password. That is because when the password is entered one time it becomes useless. TANs can be added using the TANs wizard. URL Field The URL field supports various special protocols and placeholders and can be used for Standard capabilities where URL field can execute valid URLs for which a protocol handler is defined. In addition to that, KeePass supports all registered protocols that Internet Explorer supports. URL field also offers the ability of executed command lines instead of URLs. Also, placeholders can be used that will be automatically replaced when the URL is executed. Using Stored Passwords Passwords that are stored in the database can be copied to website accounts and applications with security and without retyping them again. This can be done by several methods such us Context-Sensitive Password List, Drag and Drop, Auto-Type and KeeForm. All of them are explained better further down. Lock Workspace Last but not least at all is the locking workspace feature. This feature is turned on and locks the database when minimized. So to unlock it the Master Key is required again. The workspace can be locked manually as well by selecting this option from File menu.',\n",
              " 'Advanced end users: users that are familiar with programming and can personalize their database by creating auto-types, using command line options and generally can use features and maybe expand their use by adding more functions. End users/Desktop: users with no particular knowledge on computer programming. They just use the database for organizing their data and to keep them safe. System administrators: administrators working on computers that support a lot of accounts and personal data for other users. Using KeePass the administrator can save all data with no risk of leak to third persons. Science/Research Telecommunications: for organizing data that have to do with lots of people and applications Industry: for one-time passwords that can be used for testing controls or for expired entries to gain access in particular systems and programs.

After 10 seconds pass there is nothing to paste and you have to recopy again. That provides security in a case a password is copied and not pasted anywhere so no one can find it out by pasting later. Language Requirements in KeePass Password Safe: Not in all translations translated help files and tutorials are available. Specific Technologies used in KeePass Password Safe: In order to keep the user’s data fully protected, 2 very secure algorithms are used: Cipher Block Size Key Size Advanced Encryption Standard (AES / Rijndael) 128 bits 256 bits Twofish 128 bits 256 bits In both algorithms every time the user saves a database, a random 128-bit initialization vector is generated. For the creation of the 256-bit key the Cipher uses, the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-256 is used. All the bytes needed for the Initialization Vector, the master key salt, etc are generated via pseudorandom sources: current tick count, performance counter, system date/time, mouse cursor position, memory status, active window focus handles, window message stack, process heap status, process startup information and several system information structures. When the KeePass is active, all passwords are stored encrypted in process memory so in order for them to be completely safe the ARC4 encryption algorithm is used, using a random 12 bytes long key.',\n",
